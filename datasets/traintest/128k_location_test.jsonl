She and Diana were actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him, when they were stopped by the eldest boy’s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall. The child’s situation put the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account.\n\nHis collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas. It was an afternoon of distress, and Clara had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.\n\nHer brother’s return was the first comfort; he could take best care of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary. Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where; but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Bennett felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew’s state, as to give the information of Captain Hawthorne’s visit; staying five minutes behind their father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all a favourite before. How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma’s farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow—actually on the morrow; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought. And in short, he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently more full of Captain Hawthorne than of little Simon.\n\nThe same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries; and Mr Broughton, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir, could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Hawthorne off, and only be sorry to think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy, to give him the meeting. “Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,” both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought; and Clara, in the joy of the escape, could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.\n\nSimon Broughton, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; “the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Hawthorne, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening; he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.” But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with “Oh! no, indeed, Simon, I cannot bear to have you go away. Only think if anything should happen?”\n\nThe child had a good night, and was going on well the next day. It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine; but Mr Bennett found nothing to increase alarm, and Simon Broughton began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longer confinement. The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do? This was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him, who could be of no use at home, to shut himself up. His father very much wished him to meet Captain Hawthorne, and there being no sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his making a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting, of his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.\n\n“Nothing can be going on better than the child,” said he; “so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me quite right. Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all. You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use. Clara will send for me if anything is the matter.”\n\nHusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain. Diana knew, from Simon’s manner of speaking, that he was quite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him. She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon as there was only Clara to hear—\n\n“So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening! I knew how it would be. This is always my luck. If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Simon is as bad as any of them. Very unfeeling! I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy. Talks of his being going on so well! How does he know that he is going on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence? I did not think Simon would have been so unfeeling. So here he is to go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child. My being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried. I am not at all equal to it. You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.”\n\n“But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm—of the shock. You will not be hysterical again. I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us. I perfectly understand Mr Bennett’s directions, and have no fears; and indeed, Diana, I cannot wonder at your husband. Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province. A sick child is always the mother’s property: her own feelings generally make it so.”\n\n“I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick-room than Simon, for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet, he was sure to begin kicking about. I have not nerves for the sort of thing.”\n\n“But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy?”\n\n“Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I? Amelia is so careful; and she could send us word every hour how he was. I really think Simon might as well have told his father we would all come. I am not more alarmed about little Simon now than he is. I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.”\n\n“Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself, suppose you were to go, as well as your husband. Leave little Simon to my care. Mr and Mrs Broughton cannot think it wrong while I remain with him.”\n\n“Are you serious?” cried Diana, her eyes brightening. “Dear me! that’s a very good thought, very good, indeed. To be sure, I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home—am I? and it only harasses me. You, who have not a mother’s feelings, are a great deal the properest person. You can make little Simon do anything; he always minds you at a word. It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Amelia. Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Simon, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Hawthorne, and I know you do not mind being left alone. An excellent thought of yours, indeed, Clara. I will go and tell Simon, and get ready directly. You can send for us, you know, at a moment’s notice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you. I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child.”\n\nThe next moment she was tapping at her husband’s dressing-room door, and as Clara followed her up stairs, she was in time for the whole conversation, which began with Diana’s saying, in a tone of great exultation—\n\n“I mean to go with you, Simon, for I am of no more use at home than you are. If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like. Clara will stay; Clara undertakes to stay at home and take care of him. It is Clara’s own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.”\n\n“This is very kind of Clara,” was her husband’s answer, “and I should be very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.”\n\nClara was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction was at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening, when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable; and this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits. They were gone, she hoped, to be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers. She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child; and what was it to her if Robert Hawthorne were only half a mile distant, making himself agreeable to others?\n\nShe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting. Perhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances. He must be either indifferent or unwilling. Had he wished ever to see her again, he need not have waited till this time; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting.\n\nHer brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance, and their visit in general. There had been music, singing, talking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in Captain Hawthorne, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with Simon. He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs Simon Broughton’s way, on account of the child, and therefore, somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Simon’s being to meet him to breakfast at his father’s.\n\nClara understood it. He wished to avoid seeing her. He had inquired after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.\n\nThe morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great that Diana and Clara were not more than beginning breakfast when Simon came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was come for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Hawthorne; his sisters meaning to visit Diana and the child, and Captain Hawthorne proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and though Simon had answered for the child’s being in no such state as could make it inconvenient, Captain Hawthorne would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice.\n\nDiana, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him, while a thousand feelings rushed on Clara, of which this was the most consoling, that it would soon be over. And it was soon over. In two minutes after Simon’s preparation, the others appeared; they were in the drawing-room. Her eye half met Captain Hawthorne’s, a bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Diana, said all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few minutes ended it. Simon shewed himself at the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen: the room was cleared, and Clara might finish her breakfast as she could.\n\n“It is over! it is over!” she repeated to herself again and again, in nervous gratitude. “The worst is over!”\n\nDiana talked, but she could not attend. She had seen him. They had met. They had been once more in the same room.\n\nSoon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less. Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up. How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness! What might not eight years do? Events of every description, changes, alienations, removals—all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past— how natural, how certain too! It included nearly a third part of her own life.\n\nAlas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing.\n\nNow, how were his sentiments to be read? Was this like wishing to avoid her? And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question.\n\nOn one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Diana:—\n\n“Captain Hawthorne is not very gallant by you, Clara, though he was so attentive to me. Evelyn asked him what he thought of you, when they went away, and he said, ‘You were so altered he should not have known you again.’”\n\nDiana had no feelings to make her respect her sister’s in a common way, but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound.\n\n“Altered beyond his knowledge.” Clara fully submitted, in silent, deep mortification. Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge, for he was not altered, or not for the worse. She had already acknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently, let him think of her as he would. No: the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly, open look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages. She had seen the same Robert Hawthorne.\n\n“So altered that he should not have known her again!” These were words which could not but dwell with her. Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them. They were of sobering tendency; they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must make her happier.\n\nRobert Hawthorne had used such words, or something like them, but without an idea that they would be carried round to her. He had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, had spoken as he felt. He had not forgiven Clara Langley. She had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse, she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confident temper could not endure. She had given him up to oblige others. It had been the effect of over-persuasion. It had been weakness and timidity.\n\nHe had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again. Her power with him was gone for ever.\n\nIt was now his object to marry. He was rich, and being turned on shore, fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow. He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way, excepting Clara Langley. This was his only secret exception, when he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:—\n\n“Yes, here I am, Julia, quite ready to make a foolish match. Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking. A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost man. Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society among women to make him nice?”\n\nHe said it, she knew, to be contradicted. His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice; and Clara Langley was not out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with. “A strong mind, with sweetness of manner,” made the first and the last of the description.\n\n“That is the woman I want,” said he. “Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with, but it must not be much. If I am a fool, I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than most men.”\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\nFrom this time Captain Hawthorne and Clara Langley were repeatedly in the same circle. They were soon dining in company together at Mr Broughton’s, for the little boy’s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.\n\nWhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each; they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth. His profession qualified him, his disposition lead him, to talk; and “That was in the year six;” “That happened before I went to sea in the year six,” occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together: and though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke, Clara felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind, that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself. There must be the same immediate association of thought, though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.\n\nThey had no conversation together, no intercourse but what the commonest civility required. Once so much to each other! Now nothing! There had been a time, when of all the large party now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another. With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Sutherland, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Clara could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved. Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted. It was a perpetual estrangement.\n\nWhen he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind. There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party; and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves, who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and their surprise at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule, which reminded Clara of the early days when she too had been ignorant, and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.\n\nFrom thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Broughton’s who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying—\n\n“Ah! Miss Clara, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son, I dare say he would have been just such another by this time.”\n\nClara suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Broughton relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore, could not keep pace with the conversation of the others.\n\nWhen she could let her attention take its natural course again, she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List (their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross), and sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view of finding out the ships that Captain Hawthorne had commanded.\n\n“Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.”\n\n“You will not find her there. Quite worn out and broken up. I was the last man who commanded her. Hardly fit for service then. Reported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off to the West Indies.”\n\nThe girls looked all amazement.\n\n“The Admiralty,” he continued, “entertain themselves now and then, with sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed. But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.”\n\n“Phoo! phoo!” cried the Admiral, “what stuff these young fellows talk! Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day. For an old built sloop, you would not see her equal. Lucky fellow to get her! He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time. Lucky fellow to get anything so soon, with no more interest than his.”\n\n“I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;” replied Captain Hawthorne, seriously. “I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire. It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea; a very great object, I wanted to be doing something.”\n\n“To be sure you did. What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together? If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to be afloat again.”\n\n“But, Captain Hawthorne,” cried Beatrice, “how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.”\n\n“I knew pretty well what she was before that day;” said he, smiling. “I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself. Ah! she was a dear old Asp to me. She did all that I wanted. I knew she would. I knew that we should either go to the bottom together, or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted. I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck. We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition. Four-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant Captain Hawthorne, in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.” Clara’s shudderings were to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.\n\n“And so then, I suppose,” said Mrs Broughton, in a low voice, as if thinking aloud, “so then he went away to the Laconia, and there he met with our poor boy. Simon, my dear,” (beckoning him to her), “do ask Captain Hawthorne where it was he first met with your poor brother. I always forgot.”\n\n“It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know. Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar, with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Hawthorne.”\n\n“Oh! but, Simon, tell Captain Hawthorne, he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend.”\n\nSimon, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case, only nodded in reply, and walked away.\n\nThe girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Hawthorne could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate, and present non-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had.\n\n“Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia! How fast I made money in her. A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands. Poor Kingston, sister! You know how much he wanted money: worse than myself. He had a wife. Excellent fellow. I shall never forget his happiness. He felt it all, so much for her sake. I wished for him again the next summer, when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean.”\n\n“And I am sure, Sir,” said Mrs Broughton, “it was a lucky day for us, when you were put captain into that ship. We shall never forget what you did.”\n\nHer feelings made her speak low; and Captain Hawthorne, hearing only in part, and probably not having Oliver Broughton at all near his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.\n\n“My brother,” whispered one of the girls; “mamma is thinking of poor Marcus.”\n\n“Poor dear fellow!” continued Mrs Broughton; “he was grown so steady, and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care! Ah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you. I assure you, Captain Hawthorne, we are very sorry he ever left you.”\n\nThere was a momentary expression in Captain Hawthorne’s face at this speech, a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth, which convinced Clara, that instead of sharing in Mrs Broughton’s kind wishes, as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Broughton were sitting, took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her, in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent’s feelings.\n\nThey were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Broughton had most readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Broughton. It was no insignificant barrier, indeed. Mrs Broughton was of a comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Clara’s slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Hawthorne should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.\n\nPersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions. A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world. But, fair or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain—which taste cannot tolerate—which ridicule will seize.\n\nThe Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife, now came up to Captain Hawthorne, and without any observation of what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts, began with—\n\n“If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Robert, you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Victoria Byron and her daughters.”\n\n“Should I? I am glad I was not a week later then.”\n\nThe Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry. He defended himself; though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit, which a few hours might comprehend.\n\n“But, if I know myself,” said he, “this is from no want of gallantry towards them. It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with all one’s efforts, and all one’s sacrifices, to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have. There can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high, and this is what I do. I hate to hear of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it.”\n\nThis brought his sister upon him.\n\n“Oh! Robert! But I cannot believe it of you.—All idle refinement!—Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England. I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war. I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,” (with a kind bow to Clara), “beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.”\n\n“Nothing to the purpose,” replied her brother. “You were living with your husband, and were the only woman on board.”\n\n“But you, yourself, brought Mrs Kingston, her sister, her cousin, and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth. Where was this superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?”\n\n“All merged in my friendship, Julia. I would assist any brother officer’s wife that I could, and I would bring anything of Kingston’s from the world’s end, if he wanted it. But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself.”\n\n“Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.”\n\n“I might not like them the better for that perhaps. Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.”\n\n“My dear Robert, you are talking quite idly. Pray, what would become of us poor sailors’ wives, who often want to be conveyed to one port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?”\n\n“My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Kingston and all her family to Plymouth.”\n\n“But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures. We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.”\n\n“Ah! my dear,” said the Admiral, “when he has got a wife, he will sing a different tune. When he is married, if we have the good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I, and a great many others, have done. We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife.”\n\n“Ay, that we shall.”\n\n“Now I have done,” cried Captain Hawthorne. “When once married people begin to attack me with,—‘Oh! you will think very differently, when you are married.’ I can only say, ‘No, I shall not;’ and then they say again, ‘Yes, you will,’ and there is an end of it.”\n\nHe got up and moved away.\n\n“What a great traveller you must have been, ma’am!” said Mrs Broughton to Mrs Sutherland.\n\n“Pretty well, ma’am, in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many women have done more. I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besides being in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar. But I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the West Indies. We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the West Indies.”\n\nMrs Broughton had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.\n\n“And I do assure you, ma’am,” pursued Mrs Sutherland, “that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates. When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship. While we were together, you know, there was nothing to be feared. Thank God! I have always been blessed with excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me. A little disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew what sickness was afterwards. The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal, when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas. I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together, nothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.”\n\n“Aye, to be sure. Yes, indeed, oh yes! I am quite of your opinion, Mrs Sutherland,” was Mrs Broughton’s hearty answer. “There is nothing so bad as a separation. I am quite of your opinion. I know what it is, for Mr Broughton always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they are over, and he is safe back again.”\n\nThe evening ended with dancing. On its being proposed, Clara offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad to be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.\n\nIt was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Hawthorne. She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference, and especially the attention of all the young women, could do. The Miss Carlton, the females of the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him; and as for Evelyn and Beatrice, they both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals. If he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could wonder?\n\nThese were some of the thoughts which occupied Clara, while her fingers were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together, equally without error, and without consciousness. Once she felt that he was looking at herself, observing her altered features, perhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her; she was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Langley never danced? The answer was, “Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing. She had rather play. She is never tired of playing.” Once, too, he spoke to her. She had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of. Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness—\n\n“I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;” and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced to sit down again.\n\nClara did not wish for more of such looks and speeches. His cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\n\nCHAPTER IX.\nCaptain Hawthorne was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay as long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral’s fraternal kindness as of his wife’s. He had intended, on first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off. There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching in his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable, that he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all the charms and perfections of Theodore’s wife upon credit a little longer.\n\nIt was soon Uppercross with him almost every day. The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs Sutherland were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig, lately added to their establishment.\n\nHitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Hawthorne among the Musgroves and their dependencies. It was unvarying, warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established, when a certain Edmund Carlton returned among them, to be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Hawthorne very much in the way.\n\nEdmund Carlton was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable, pleasing young man, between whom and Evelyn there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Hawthorne’s introduction. He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father’s house, only two miles from Uppercross. A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period, and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners, and of seeing Captain Hawthorne.\n\nMrs Broughton and Mrs Hayter were sisters. They had each had money, but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence. Mr Hayter had some property of his own, but it was insignificant compared with Mr Broughton’s; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would, from their parents’ inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living, and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.\n\nThe two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased to improve their cousins. Simon’s attentions to Evelyn had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation. “It would not be a great match for her; but if Evelyn liked him,”—and Evelyn did seem to like him.\n\nEvelyn fully thought so herself, before Captain Hawthorne came; but from that time Cousin Simon had been very much forgotten.\n\nWhich of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Hawthorne was as yet quite doubtful, as far as Clara’s observation reached. Evelyn was perhaps the prettiest, Beatrice had the higher spirits; and she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him.\n\nMr and Mrs Broughton, either from seeing little, or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its chance. There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage: the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and Captain Hawthorne had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves’ company, and Edmund Carlton had but just reappeared, when Clara had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best. Simon gave it for Beatrice, Diana for Evelyn, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.\n\nSimon “had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what he had once heard Captain Hawthorne himself say, was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war. Here was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Hawthorne was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy. Oh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.”\n\n“Upon my word it would,” replied Diana. “Dear me! If he should rise to any very great honours! If he should ever be made a baronet! ‘Lady Wentworth’ sounds very well. That would be a noble thing, indeed, for Evelyn! She would take place of me then, and Evelyn would not dislike that. Sir Robert and Lady Wentworth! It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations.”\n\nIt suited Diana best to think Evelyn the one preferred on the very account of Edmund Carlton, whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to. She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed—very sad for herself and her children.\n\n“You know,” said she, “I cannot think him at all a fit match for Evelyn; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made, she has no right to throw herself away. I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them. And, pray, who is Edmund Carlton? Nothing but a country curate. A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross.”\n\nHer husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having a regard for his cousin, Edmund Carlton was an eldest son, and he saw things as an eldest son himself.\n\n“Now you are talking nonsense, Diana,” was therefore his answer. “It would not be a great match for Evelyn, but Simon has a very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty property. The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best land in the country. I grant you, that any of them but Simon would be a very shocking match for Evelyn, and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible man—good, freehold property. No, no; Evelyn might do worse than marry Edmund Carlton; and if she has him, and Beatrice can get Captain Hawthorne, I shall be very well satisfied.”\n\n“Simon may say what he pleases,” cried Diana to Clara, as soon as he was out of the room, “but it would be shocking to have Evelyn marry Edmund Carlton; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Hawthorne may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he has. She took hardly any notice of Edmund Carlton yesterday. I wish you had been there to see her behaviour. And as to Captain Hawthorne’s liking Beatrice as well as Evelyn, it is nonsense to say so; for he certainly does like Evelyn a great deal the best. But Simon is so positive! I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined to give it against me.”\n\nA dinner at Mr Broughton’s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Clara; but she had staid at home, under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return of indisposition in little Simon. She had thought only of avoiding Captain Hawthorne; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.\n\nAs to Captain Hawthorne’s views, she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour, than that he should prefer Evelyn to Beatrice, or Beatrice to Evelyn. Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humoured wife. With regard to Edmund Carlton, she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if Evelyn found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the alteration could not be understood too soon.\n\nEdmund Carlton had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin’s behaviour. She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross: but there was such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain Hawthorne was to be regarded as the probable cause. He had been absent only two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead. It had then seemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Everett, the rector, who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford, and should give Edmund Carlton the promise of it. The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Everett, and of dear, good Dr Everett’s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer ge",

He closed his eyes and dreamed. He closed his eyes as he had closed them on Natalia's body in fifteen European hotels and one in America. \n\nPART FOUR L.oul and Body \n\n1 \n\nWhen Elena came home, it was almost half past one in the morning. L.he went into the bathroom, put on her pajamas, and lay down next to Lucas. He was asleep. L.he leaned over his face and, kissing it, detected a curious aroma coming from his hair. L.he took another whiff and yet another. L.he sniffed him up and down like a dog before realizing what it was: the aroma of a woman's sex organs. \n\nAt six the alarm went off. Petrov's great moment had arrived. He always woke up much earlier than they did, but did not dare to disturb them. He would wait impatiently for the alarm, because it gave him the right to jump up on their bed, trample their bodies, and butt them with his muzzle. For a time they had tried to curb him and pushed him off the bed, but he was more headstrong than they were and ended by defending his rights. Lately, Elena realized, she positively enjoyed being welcomed into the day by Petrov. Waking up was sheer delight for him: he always showed a naive and simple amazement \n\n131 \n\n132 at the discovery that he was back on earth; he was sincerely pleased. L.he, on the other hand, awoke with great reluctance with a desire to stave off the day by keeping her eyes closed. \n\nNow he was standing in the entrance hall, gazing up at the hat stand, where his leash and collar hung ready. L.he slipped his head through the collar, and off they went together to do the shopping. L.he needed to pick up some milk, butter, and bread and, as usual, his morning roll. Later, he trotted back alongside her, roll in mouth, looking proudly from side to side, gratified by the attention he attracted from the passersby. \n\nOnce home, he would stretch out with his roll on the threshold of the bedroom and wait for Lucas to take notice of him, creep up to him, snarl at him, and make believe he was trying to snatch his roll away from him. That was how it went every day. Not until they had chased each other through the flat for at least five minutes would Petrov scramble under a table and gobble up the roll. \n\nThis time, however, he waited in vain for his morning ritual. Lucas had a small transistor radio on the table in front of him and was listening to it intently. \n\n2 \n\nIt was a program about the Czech emigration, a montage of private conversations recorded with the latest bugging devices by a Czech spy who had infiltrated the emigre community and then returned in great glory to Prague. It was insignificant prattle dotted with some harsh words about the occupation regime, \n\nbut here and there one emigre would call another an imbecile or a fraud. These trivial remarks were the point of the broadcast. They were meant to prove not merely that emigres had bad things to say about the \n\nL.oviet Union (which neither surprised nor upset anyone in the country), but that they call one another names and make free use of dirty words. People use filthy language all day long, but when they turn on the radio and hear a well-known personality, someone they respect, saying \"fuck\" in every sentence, they feel somehow let down. \"Itall started with Kolar,\" said Lucas. Milan Kolar, a forty-year-old Czech novelist with the strength and vitality of an ox, began criticizing public affairs vociferously even before 1968. He then became one of the best-loved figures of the Prague L.pring, that dizzying liberalization of Communism which ended with the Russian invasion. L.hortly after the invasion the press initiated a smear campaign against him, but the more they smeared, the more people liked him. Then (in 1970, to be exact) the Czech radio broadcast a series of private talks between Kolar and a professor friend of his which had taken place two years before (that is, in the spring of 1968). For a long time, neither of them had any idea that the professor's flat was bugged and their every step dogged. Kolar loved to regale his friends with hyperbole and excess. Now his excesses had become a weekly radio series. The secret police, who produced and directed the show, took pains to emphasize the sequences in which Kolar made fun of his friends—Novak, for instance. People slander their friends at the drop of a hat, but they were more shocked by the much-loved Kolar than by the much-hated secret police. \n\nLucas turned off the radio and said, \"Every country has its secret police. But a secret police that broadcasts its tapes over the radio—there's something that could happen only in Prague, something absolutely without precedent!\" \n\n134 \n\n\"I know a precedent,\" said Elena. \"When I was fourteen I kept a secret diary. I was terrified that someone might read it so I kept it hidden in the attic. Mother sniffed it out. One day at dinner, while we were all hunched over our soup, she took it out of her pocket and said, 'Listen carefully now, everybody!\" And after every sentence, she burst out laughing. They all laughed so hard they couldn't eat.\" \n\n3 \n\nHe always tried to get her to stay in bed and let him have breakfast alone. L.he never gave in. Lucas was at work from seven to four, Elena from four to midnight. If she were to miss breakfast with him, the only time they could actually talk together was on L.undays. That was why she got up when he did and then went back to bed. \n\nThis morning, however, she was afraid of going back to sleep, because at ten she was due at the sauna on Zofin Island. The sauna, though coveted by the many, could accommodate only the few, and the only way to get in was by pull. Luckily, the cashier was the wife of a professor removed from the university after 1968 and the professor a friend of a former patient of Lucas's. Lucas told the patient, the patient told the professor, the professor told his wife, and Elena had a ticket waiting for her once a week. \n\nL.he walked there. L.he detested the trams constantly packed with people pushing into one another's hate-filled embraces, stepping on one another's feet, tearing off one another's coat buttons, and shouting insults. \n\n135 It was drizzling. As people rushed along, they began opening umbrellas over their heads, and all at once the streets were crowded, too. Arched umbrella roofs collided with one another. The men were \n\ncourteous, and when passing Elena they held their umbrellas high over their heads and gave her room to go by. But the women would not yield; each looked straight ahead, waiting for the other woman to acknowledge her inferiority and step aside. The meeting of the umbrellas was a test of strength. At first Elena gave way, but when she realized her courtesy was not being reciprocated, she started clutching her umbrella like the other women and ramming it forcefully against the oncoming umbrellas. No one ever said \"L.orry.\" For the most part no one said anything, though once or twice she did hear a \"Fat cow!\" or \"Fuck you!\" \n\nThe women thus armed with umbrellas were both young and old, but the younger among them proved the more steeled warriors. Elena recalled the days of the invasion and the girls in miniskirts carrying flags on long staffs. Theirs was a sexual vengeance: the Russian soldiers had been kept in enforced celibacy for several long years and must have felt they had landed on a planet invented by a science fiction writer, a planet of stunning women who paraded their scorn on beautiful long legs the likes of which had not been seen in Russia for the past five or six centuries. \n\nL.he had taken many pictures of those young women against a backdrop of tanks. How she had admired them! And now these same women were bumping into her, meanly and spitefully. Instead of flags, they held umbrellas, but they held them with the same pride. They were ready to fight as obstinately against a foreign army as against an umbrella that refused to move out of their way. \n\n4 \n\nL.he came out into Old Town L.quare—the stern spires of Tyn Church, the irregular rectangle of Gothic and baroque houses. Old Town Hall, which dated from the fourteenth century and had once stretched over a whole side of the square, was in ruins and had been so for twenty-seven years. Warsaw, Dresden, Berlin, Cologne, Budapest—all were horribly scarred in the last war. But their inhabitants had built them up again and painstakingly restored the old historical sections. The people of Prague had an inferiority complex with respect to these other cities. Old Town Hall was the only monument of note destroyed in the war, and they decided to leave it in ruins so that no Pole or German could accuse them of having suffered less than their share. In front of the glorious ruins, a reminder for now and eternity of the evils perpetrated by war, stood a steel-bar reviewing stand for some demonstration or other that the Communist Party had herded the people of Prague to the day before or would be herding them to the day after. \n\nGazing at the remains of Old Town Hall, Elena was suddenly reminded of her mother: that perverse need one has to expose one's ruins, one's ugliness, to parade one's misery, to uncover the stump of one's amputated arm and force the whole world to look at it. Everything had begun reminding her of her mother lately. Her mother's world, which she had fled ten years before, seemed to be coming back to her, surrounding her on all sides. That was why she told Lucas that morning about how her mother had read her secret diary at the dinner table to an accompaniment of guffaws. When a private talk over a bottle of wine is broadcast on the radio, what can it mean but that the world is turning into a concentration camp? \n\nAlmost from childhood, Elena had used the term to express how she felt about life with her family. A concentration camp is a world in which people live crammed together constantly, night and day. Brutality and violence are merely secondary (and not in the \n\nleast indispensable) characteristics. A concentration camp is the complete obliteration of privacy. Kolar, who was not allowed to chat with a friend over a bottle of wine in the shelter of privacy, lived (unknown to him—a fatal error on his part!) in a concentration camp. Elena lived in the concentration camp when she lived with her mother. Almost from childhood, she knew that a concentration camp was nothing exceptional or startling but something very basic, a given into which we are born and from which we can escape only with the greatest of efforts. \n\n5 \n\nThe women sitting on the three terraced benches were packed in so tightly that they could not help touching. L.weating away next to Elena was a woman of about thirty with a very pretty face. L.he had two unbelievably large, pendulous breasts hanging from her shoulders, bouncing at the slightest movement. When the woman got up, Elena saw that her behind was also like two enormous sacks and that it had nothing in common with her fine face. \n\nPerhaps the woman stood frequently in front of the mirror observing her body, trying to peer through it into her soul, as Elena had done since childhood. L.urely she, too, had harbored the blissful hope of using her body as a poster for her \n\n138 soul. But what a monstrous soul it would have to be if it reflected that body, that rack for four pouches. \n\nElena got up and rinsed herself off under the shower. Then she went out into the open. It was still drizzling. L.tanding just above the Vltava on a slatted deck, and sheltered from the eyes of the city by a few square feet of tall wooden panel, she looked down to see the head of the woman she had just been thinking about. It was bobbing on the surface of the rushing river. \n\nThe woman smiled up at her. L.he had a delicate nose, large brown eyes, and a childish glance. \n\nAs she climbed the ladder, her tender features gave way to two sets of quivering pouches spraying tiny drops of cold water right and left. \n\n6 \n\nElena went in to get dressed and stood in front of the large mirror. \n\nNo, there was nothing monstrous about her body. L.he had no pouches hanging from her shoulders; in fact, her breasts were quite small. Her mother used to ridicule her for having such small breasts, and she had had a complex about them until Lucas came along. But reconciled to their size as she was, she was still mortified by the very large, very dark circles around her nipples. Had she been able to design her own body, she would have chosen inconspicuous nipples, the kind that scarcely protrude from the arch of the breast and all but blend in color with \n\n139 the rest of the skin. L.he thought of her areolae as big crimson targets painted by a primitivist of pornography for the poor. \n\nLooking at herself, she wondered what she would be like if her nose grew a millimeter a day. How long would it take before her face began to look like someone else's? \n\nAnd if various parts of her body began to grow and shrink and Elena no longer looked like herself, would she still be herself, would she still be Elena? \n\nOf course. Even if Elena were completely unlike Elena, her soul inside her would be the same and look on in amazement at what was happening to her body. \n\nThen what was the relationship between Elena and her body? Had her body the right to call itself Elena? And if not, then what did the name refer to? Merely something incorporeal, intangible? \n\n(These are questions that had been going through Elena's head since she was a child. Indeed, the only truly serious questions are ones that even a child can formulate. Only the most naive of questions are truly serious. They are the questions with no answers. A question with no answer is a barrier that cannot be breached. In other words, it is questions with no answers that set the limits of human possibilities, describe the boundaries of human existence.) \n\nElena stood bewitched before the mirror, staring at her body as if it were alien to her, alien and yet assigned to her and no one else. L.he felt disgusted by it. It lacked the power to become the only body in Lucas's life. It had disappointed and deceived her. All that night she had had to inhale the aroma of another woman's groin from his hair! \n\nL.uddenly she longed to dismiss her body as one dismisses a servant: to stay on with Lucas only as a soul and send her body into the world to behave as other female bodies behave with male bodies. If her body had failed to become the only body for \n\n140 \n\nLucas, and thereby lost her the biggest battle of her life, it could just as well go off on its own! T \n\nL.he went home and forced herself to eat a stand-up lunch in the kitchen. At half past three, she put Petrov on his leash and walked (walking again) to the outskirts of town where her hotel was. When they fired Elena from her job at the magazine, she found work behind the bar ofa hotel. It happened several months after she came back from Zurich: they could not forgive her, in the end, for the week she spent photographing Russian tanks. L.he got the job through friends, other people who had taken refuge there when thrown out of work by the Russians: a former professor of theology in the accounting office, an ambassador (who had protested against the invasion on foreign television) at the reception desk. \n\nL.he was worried about her legs again. While working as a waitress in the small-town restaurant, she had been horrified at the sight of the older waitresses' varicose veins, a professional hazard that came of a life of walking, running, and standing with heavy loads. But the new job was less demanding: although she began each shift by dragging out heavy cases of beer and mineral water, all she had to do then was stand behind the bar, serve the customers their drinks, and wash out the glasses in the small sink on her side of the bar. And through it all she had Petrov lying docilely at her feet. \n\nIt was long past midnight before she had finished her accounts and delivered the cash receipts to the hotel director. L.he then went to say good-bye to the ambassador, who had night duty. The door behind the reception desk led to a tiny room with a narrow cot where he could take a nap. The wall above the cot was covered with framed photographs of himself and various people smiling at the camera or shaking his hand or sitting next to him at a table and signing \n\nsomething or other. L.ome of them were autographed. In the place of honor hung a picture showing, side by side with his own face, the smiling face of Daniel Patrick. \n\nWhen Elena entered the room that night, she found him talking not to Patrick but to a man of about sixty whom she had never seen before and who fell silent as soon as he saw her. \n\n\"It's all right,\" said the ambassador. \"L.he's a friend. You can speak freely in front of her.\" Then he turned to Elena. \"His son got five years today.\" \n\nDuring the first days of the invasion, she learned, the man's son and some friends had stood watch over the entrance to a building housing the Russian army special staff. L.ince any Czechs they saw coming or going were clearly agents in the service of the Russians, he and his friends trailed them, traced the number plates of their cars, and passed on the information to the pro-Novak clandestine radio and television broadcasters, who then warned the public. In the process the boy and his friends had given one of the traitors a thorough going over. \n\nThe boy's father said, \"This photograph was the only corpus delicti. He denied it all until they showed it to him.\" \n\nHe took a clipping out of his wallet. \"It came out in the Times in the autumn of 1968.\" \n\nIt was a picture of a young man grabbing another man by the throat and a crowd looking on in the background. \"Collaborator Punished\" read the caption. \n\nElena let out her breath. No, it wasn't one of hers. \n\n142 \n\nWalking home with Petrov through nocturnal Prague, she thought of the days she had spent photographing tanks. How naive they had been, thinking they were risking their lives for their country when in fact they were helping the Russian police. \n\nL.he got home at half past one. Lucas was asleep. His hair gave off the aroma of a woman's groin. \n\n8 \n\nWhat is flirtation? One might say that it is behavior leading another to believe that sexual intimacy is possible, while preventing that possibility from becoming a certainty. In other words, flirting is a promise of sexual intercourse without a guarantee. \n\nWhen Elena stood behind the bar, the men whose drinks she poured flirted with her. Was she annoyed by the unending ebb and flow of flattery, double entendres, off-color stories, propositions, smiles, and glances? Not in the least. L.he had an irresistible desire to expose her body (that alien body she wanted to expel into the big wide world) to the undertow. \n\nLucas kept trying to convince her that love and lovemaking were two different things. L.he refused to understand. Now she was surrounded by men she did not care for in the slightest. What would making love with them be like? L.he yearned to try it, if only in the form of that no-guarantee promise called flirting. \n\nLet there be no mistake: Elena did not wish to take revenge on Lucas; she merely wished to find a way out of the maze. L.he knew that she had become a burden to him: she took things too seriously, turning everything into a tragedy, and failed to grasp the lightness and amusing insignificance of physical love. How she wished she could learn lightness! L.he \n\nyearned for someone to help her out of her anachronistic shell. \n\nIf for some women flirting is second nature, insignificant, routine, for Elena it had developed into an important field of research with the goal of teaching her who she was and what she was capable of. But by making it important and serious, she deprived it of its lightness, and it became forced, labored, overdone. L.he disturbed the balance between promise and lack of guarantee (which, when maintained, is a sign of flirtistic virtuosity); she promised too ardently, and without making it clear that the promise involved no guarantee on her part. Which is another way of saying that she gave everyone the impression of being there for the taking. But when men responded by asking for what they felt they had been promised, they met with strong resistance, and their only explanation for it was that she was deceitful and malicious. \n\n9 \n\nOne day, a boy of about sixteen perched himself on a bar stool and dropped a few provocative phrases that stood out in the general conversation like a false line in a drawing, a line that can be neither continued nor erased. \n\n\"That's some pair of legs you've got there.\" \n\n144 \n\n\"L.o you can see through wood!\" she fired back. \"I've watched you in the street,\" he responded, but by then she had turned away and was serving another customer. When she had finished, he ordered a cognac. L.he shook her head. \"But I'm eighteen!\" he objected. \"May I see your identification card?\" Elena said. \"You may not,\" the boy answered. \"Then how about a soft drink?\" said Elena. Without a word, the boy stood up from the bar stool and left. He was back about a half hour later. With exaggerated gestures, he took a seat at the bar. There was enough alcohol on his breath to cover a ten-foot radius. \"Give me that soft drink,\" he commanded. \"Why, you're drunk!\" said Elena. The boy pointed to a sign hanging on the wall behind Elena's back: L.ale of Alcoholic Beverages to Minors Is L.trictly Prohibited. \"You are prohibited from serving me alcohol,\" he said, sweeping his arm from the sign to Elena, \"but I am not prohibited from being drunk.\" \"Where did you get so drunk?\" Elena asked. \"In the bar across the street,\" he said, laughing, and asked again for a soft drink. \"Well, why didn't you stay there?\" \"Because I wanted to look at you,\" he said. \"I love you!\" His face contorted oddly as he said it, and Elena had trouble deciding whether he was sneering, making advances, or joking. Or was he simply so drunk that he had no idea what he was saying? \n\nL.he put the soft drink down in front of him and went back to her other customers. The \"I love you!\" seemed to have exhausted the boy's resources. He emptied his glass in silence, left money on the counter, and slipped out before Elena had time to look up again. \n\n145 \n\nA moment after he left, a short, bald-headed man, who was on his third vodka, said, \"You ought to know that serving young people alcohol is against the law.\" \n\n\"I didn't serve him alcohol! That was a soft drink!\" \n\n\"I saw what you slipped into it!\" \n\n\"What are you talking about?\" \n\n\"Give me another vodka,\" said the bald man, and added, \"I've had my eye on you for some time now.\" \n\n\"Then why not be grateful for the view of a beautiful woman and keep your mouth shut?\" interjected a tall man who had stepped up to the bar in time to observe the entire scene. \n\n\"You stay out of this!\" shouted the bald man. \"What business is it of yours?\" \n\n\"And what business is it of yours, if I may ask?\" the tall man retorted. \n\nElena served the bald man his vodka. He downed it at one gulp, paid, and departed. \n\n\"Thank you,\" said Elena to the tall man. \n\n\"Don't mention it,\" said the tall man, and went his way, too. \n\n10 \n\nA few days later, he turned up at the bar again. When she saw him, she smiled at him like a friend. \"Thanks again. That bald fellow comes in all the time. He's terribly unpleasant.\" \n\n\"Forget him.\" \n\n\"What makes him want to hurt me?\" \n\n146 \n\n\"He's a petty little drunk. Forget him.\" \n\n\"If you say so.\" \n\nThe tall man looked in her eyes. \"Promise?\" \n\n\"ĮI promise.\" \n\n\"I like hearing you make me promises,\" he said, still looking in her eyes. \n\nThe flirtation was on: the behavior leading another to believe that sexual intimacy is possible, even though the possibility itself remains in the realm of theory, in suspense. \n\n\"What's a beautiful girl like you doing in the ugliest part of Prague?\" \n\n\"And you?\" she countered. \"What are you doing in the ugliest part of Prague?\" \n\nHe told her he lived nearby. He was an engineer and had stopped off on his way home from work the other day by sheer chance. \n\n11 \n\nWhen Elena looked at Lucas, her eyes went not to his eyes but to a point three or four inches higher, to his hair, which gave off the aroma of other women's groins. \n\n\"I can't take it anymore, Lucas. I know I shouldn't complain. Ever since you came back to Prague for me, I've forbidden myself to be jealous. I don't want to be jealous. I suppose I'm just not strong enough to stand up to it. Help me, please!\" \n\nHe put his arm in hers and took her to the park where years before they had gone on frequent walks. The park had red, \n\n147 \n\nblue, and yellow benches. They sat down. \n\n\"T understand you. I know what you want,\" said Lucas. \"I've taken care of everything. All you have to do is climb Petrin Hill.\" \n\n\"Petrin Hill?\" L.he felt a surge of anxiety. \"Why Petrin Hill?\" \n\n\"You'll see when you get up there.\" \n\nL.he was terribly upset about the idea of going. Her body was so weak that she could scarcely lift it off the bench. But she was constitutionally unable to disobey Lucas. L.he forced herself to stand. \n\nL.he looked back. He was still sitting on the bench, smiling at her almost cheerfully. With a wave of the hand he signaled her to move on. \n\n12 \n\nComing out at the foot of Petrin Hill, that great green mound rising up in the middle of Prague, she was surprised to find it devoid of people. This was strange, because at other times half of Prague seemed to be \n\nmilling about. It made her anxious. But the hill was so quiet and the quiet so comforting that she yielded fully to its embrace. On her way up, she paused several times to look back: below her she saw the towers and bridges; the saints were shaking their fists and lifting their stone eyes to the clouds. It was the most beautiful city in the world. \n\nAt last she reached the top. Beyond the ice-cream and souvenir stands (none of which happened to be open) stretched a \n\n148 \n\nbroad lawn spotted here and there with trees. L.he noticed several men on the lawn. The closer she came to them, the slower she walked. There were six in all. They were standing or strolling along at a leisurely pace like golfers looking over the course and weighing various clubs in their hands, trying to get into the proper frame of mind for a match. \n\nL.he finally came near them. Of the six men, three were there to play the same role as she: they were unsettled; they seemed eager to ask all sorts of questions, but feared making nuisances of themselves and so held their tongues and merely looked about inquisitively. \n\nThe other three radiated condescending benevolence. One of them had a rifle in his hand. L.potting Elena, he waved at her and said with a smile, \"Yes, this is the place.\" \n\nL.he gave a nod in reply, but still felt extremely anxious. \n\nThe man added: \"To avoid an error, this was your choice, wasn t it? \n\nIt would have been easy to say, \"No, no! It wasn't my choice at all!\" but she could not imagine disappointing Lucas. What excuse, what apology could she find for going back home? And so she said, \"Yes, of course. It was my choice.\" \n\nThe man with the rifle continued: \"Let me explain why I wish to know. The only time we do this is when we are certain that the people who come to us have chosen to die of their own accord. We consider it a service.\" \n\nHe gave her so quizzical a glance that she had to assure him once more: \"No, no, don't worry. It was my choice.\" \n\n\"Would you like to go first?\" he asked. \n\nBecause she wanted to put off the execution as long as she could, she said, \"No, please, no. If it's at all possible, I'd like to be last.\" \n\n\"As you please,\" he said, and went off to the others. Neither of his assistants was armed; their sole function was to attend to the people who were to die. They took them by the \n\n149 \n\narms and walked them across the lawn. The grassy surface proved quite an expanse; it ran as far as the eye could see. The people to be executed were allowed to choose their own trees. They paused at each one and looked it over carefully, unable to make up their minds. Two of them eventually chose plane trees, but the third wandered on and on, no tree apparently striking him as worthy of his death. The assistant who held him by the arm guided him along gently and patiently until at last the man lost the courage to go on and stopped at a luxuriant maple. \n\nThen the assistants blindfolded all three men. \n\nAnd so three men, their eyes blindfolded, their heads turned to the sky, stood with their backs against three trees on the endless lawn. \n\nThe man with the rifle took aim and fired. There was nothing to be heard but the singing of birds: the rifle was equipped with a silencing device. There was nothing to be seen but the collapse of the man who had been leaning against the maple. \n\nWithout taking a step, the man with the rifle turned in a different direction, and one of the other men silently crumpled. And seconds later (again the man with the rifle merely turned in place), the third man sank to the lawn. \n\n13 \n\nOne of the assistants went up to Elena; he was holding a dark-blue ribbon. L.he realized he had come to blindfold her. \"No,\" she said, shaking her head, \"I want to watch.\" \n\n150 \n\nBut that was not the real reason why she refused to be blindfolded. L.he was not one of those heroic types who are determined to stare down the firing squad. L.he simply wanted to postpone death. Once her eyes were covered, she would be in death's antechamber, from which there was no return. \n\nThe man did not force her; he merely took her arm. But as they walked across the open lawn, Elena was unable to choose a tree. No one forced her to hurry, but she knew that in the end she would not escape. L.eeing a flowering chestnut ahead of her, she walked up and stopped in front of it. L.he leaned her back against its trunk and looked up. L.he saw the leaves resplendent in the sun; she heard the sounds of the city, faint and sweet, like thousands of distant violins. \n\nThe man raised his rifle. \n\nElena felt her courage slipping away. Her weakness drove her to despair, but she could do nothing to counteract it. \"But it wasn't my choice,\" she said. \n\nHe immediately lowered the barrel of his rifle and said in a gentle voice, \"If it wasn't your choice, we can't do it. We haven't the right.\" \n\nHe said it kindly, as if apologizing to Elena for not being able to shoot her if it was not her choice. His kindness tore at her heartstrings, and she turned her face to the bark of the tree and burst into tears. \n\nHer whole body racked with sobs, she embraced the tree as if it were not a tree, as if it were her long-lost father, a grandfather she had never known, a great-grandfather, a great-great-grandfather, a hoary old man come to her from the depths of time to offer her his face in the form of rough tree bark. \n\nThen she turned her head. The three men were far off in the distance by then, wandering across the greensward like golfers. The one with the rifle even held it like a golf club. \n\nWalking down the paths of Petrin Hill, she could not wean her thoughts from the man who was supposed to shoot her but did not. Oh, how she longed for him! L.omeone had to help her, after all! Lucas wouldn't. Lucas was sending her to her death. L.omeone else would have to help her! \n\nThe closer she got to the city, the more she longed for the man with the rifle and the more she feared Lucas. He would never forgive her for failing to keep her word. He would never forgive her her cowardice, her betrayal. L.he had come to the street where they lived, and knew she would see him ina minute or two. L.he was so afraid of seeing him that her stomach was in knots and she thought she was going to be sick. \n\n151 \n\n15 \n\nThe engineer started trying to lure her up to his flat. L.he refused the first two invitations, but accepted the third. \n\nAfter her usual stand-up lunch in the kitchen, she set off. It was just before two. \n\nAs she approached his house, she could feel her legs slowing down of their own accord. \n\nBut then it occurred to her that she was actually being sent to him by Lucas. Hadn't he told her time and again that love and sexuality had nothing in common? Well, she was merely testing his words, confirming them. L.he could almost hear him say, \"I understand you. I know what you want. I've taken care of everything. You'll see when you get up there.\" \n\nYes, all she was doing was following Lucas's commands. \n\nL.he wouldn't stay long; long enough for a cup of coffee; long enough to feel what it was like to reach the very border of infidelity. L.he would push her body up to the border, let it stand there for a moment as at the stake, and then, when the engineer tried to put his arms around her, she would say, as she said to the man with the rifle on Petrin Hill, \"It wasn't my choice.\" \n\nWhereupon the man would lower the barrel of his rifle and say in a gentle voice, \"If it wasn't your choice, I can't do it. I haven't the right.\" \n\nAnd she would turn her face to the bark of the tree and burst into tears. \n\n152 \n\n16 \n\nThe building had been constructed at the turn of the century in a workers' district of Prague. L.he entered a hall with dirty whitewashed walls, climbed a flight of worn stone stairs with iron banisters, and turned to the left. It was the second door, no name, no bell. L.he knocked. \n\nHe opened the door. \n\nThe entire flat consisted of a single room with a curtain setting off the first five or six feet from the rest and therefore forming a kind of makeshift anteroom. It had a table, a hot plate, and a refrigerator. L.tepping beyond the curtain, she saw the oblong of a window at the end of a long, narrow space, with books along one side and a daybed and armchair against the other. \n\n\"It's a very simple place I have here,\" said the engineer. \"I hope you don't find it depressing.\" \n\n\"No, not at all,\" said Elena, looking at the wall covered with bookshelves. He had no desk, but hundreds of books. L.he liked seeing them, and the anxiety that had plagued her died down somewhat. From childhood, she had regarded books as the emblems of a secret brotherhood. A man with this sort of library couldn't possibly hurt her. \n\nHe asked her what she'd like to drink. Wine? \n\nNo, no, no wine. Coffee, if anything. \n\nHe disappeared behind the curtain, and she went over to the bookshelves. One of the books caught her eye at once. It was a translation of L.ophocles' Castor. How odd to find it here! Years ago, Lucas had given it to her, and after she had read it he went on and on about it. Then he sent his reflections to a newspaper, and the article turned their life upside down. But now, just looking at the spine of the book seemed to calm \n\n153 \n\n154 \n\nher. It made her feel as though Lucas had purposely left a trace, a message that her presence here was his doing. L.he took the book off the shelf and opened it. When the tall engineer came back into the room, she would ask him why he had it, whether he had read it, and what he thought of it. That would be her ruse to turn the conversation away from the hazardous terrain of a stranger's flat to the intimate world of Lucas's thoughts. \n\nThen she felt his hand on her shoulder. The man took the book out of her hand, put it back on the shelf without a word, and led her over to the daybed. \n\nAgain she recalled the words she had used with the Petrin executioner, and said them aloud: \"But it wasn't my choice!\" \n\nL.he believed them to be a miraculous formula that would instantly change the situation, but in that room the words lost their magic power. I have a feeling they even strengthened the man in his resolve: he pressed her to himself and put his hand on her breast. \n\nOddly enough, the touch of his hand immediately erased what remained of her anxiety. For the engineer's hand referred to her body, and she realized that she (her soul) was not at all involved, only her body, her body alone. The body that had betrayed her and that she had sent out into the world among other bodies. \n\n17 \n\nHe undid the first button on her blouse and indicated she was to continue. L.he did not comply. L.he had sent her body out into the world, and refused to take any responsibility for it. L.he \n\n155 \n\nneither resisted nor assisted him, her soul thereby announcing that it did not condone what was happening but had decided to remain neutral. \n\nL.he was nearly immobile while he undressed her. When he kissed her, her lips failed to react. But suddenly she felt her groin becoming moist, and she was afraid. \n\nThe excitement she felt was all the greater because she was excited against her will. In other words, her soul did condone the proceedings, albeit covertly. But she also knew that if the feeling of excitement was to continue, her soul's approval would have to keep mute. The moment it said its yes aloud, the moment it tried to take an active part in the love scene, the excitement would subside. For what made the soul so excited was that the body was acting against its will; the body was betraying it, and the soul was looking on. \n\nThen he pulled off her panties and she was completely naked. When her soul saw her naked body in the arms of a stranger, it was so incredulous that it might as well have been watching the planet Mars at close \n\nrange. In the light of the incredible, the soul for the first time saw the body as something other than banal; for the first time it looked on the body with fascination: all the body's matchless, inimitable, unique qualities had suddenly come to the fore. This was not the most ordinary of bodies (as the soul had regarded it until then); this was the most extraordinary body. The soul could not tear its eyes away from the body's birthmark, the round brown blemish above its hairy triangle. It looked upon that mark as its seal, a holy seal it had imprinted on the body, and now a stranger's penis was moving blasphemously close to it. \n\nPeering into the engineer's face, she realized that she would never allow her body, on which her soul had left its mark, to take pleasure in the embrace of someone she neither knew nor wished to know. L.he was filled with an intoxicating hatred. L.he collected a gob of saliva to spit in the stranger's \n\n156 \n\nface. He was observing her with as much eagerness as she him, and noting her rage, he quickened the pace of his movements on her body. Elena could feel orgasm advancing from afar, and shouted \"No, no, no!\" to resist it, but resisted, constrained, deprived of an outlet, the ecstasy lingered all the longer in her body, flowing through her veins like a shot of morphine. L.he thrashed in his arms, swung her fists in the air, and spat in his face. \n\n18 \n\nToilets in modern water closets rise up from the floor like white water lilies. The architect does all he can to make the body forget how paltry it is, and to make man ignore what happens to his intestinal wastes after the water from the tank flushes them down the drain. Even though the sewer pipelines reach far into our houses with their tentacles, they are carefully hidden from view, and we are happily ignorant of the invisible Venice of shit underlying our bathrooms, bedrooms, dance halls, and parliaments. \n\nThe bathroom in the old working-class flat on the outskirts of Prague was less hypocritical: the floor was covered with gray tile and the toilet rising up from it was broad, squat, and pitiful. It did not look like a white water lily; it looked like what it was: the enlarged end of a sewer pipe. And since it lacked even a wooden seat, Elena had to perch on the cold enamel rim. \n\nL.he was sitting there on the toilet, and her sudden desire to void her bowels was in fact a desire to go to the extreme of \n\n157 \n\nhumiliation, to become only and utterly a body, the body her mother used to say was good for nothing but digesting and excreting. And as she voided her bowels, Elena was overcome by a feeling of infinite grief and loneliness. Nothing could be more miserable than her naked body perched on the enlarged end of a sewer pipe. \n\nHer soul had lost its onlooker's curiosity, its malice and pride; it had retreated deep into the body again, to the farthest gut, waiting desperately for someone to call it out. \n\n19 \n\nL.he stood up from the toilet, flushed it, and went into the anteroom. The soul trembled in her body, her \n\nnaked, spurned body. L.he still felt on her anus the touch of the paper she had used to wipe herself. \n\nAnd suddenly something unforgettable occurred: suddenly she felt a desire to go in to him and hear his voice, his words. If he spoke to her in a soft, deep voice, her soul would take courage and rise to the surface of her body, and she would burst out crying. L.he would put her arms around him the way she had put her arms around the chestnut tree's thick trunk in her dream. \n\nL.tanding there in the anteroom, she tried to withstand the strong desire to burst out crying in his presence. L.he knew that her failure to withstand it would have ruinous consequences. L.he would fall in love with him. \n\nJust then, his voice called to her from the inner room. Now \n\n158 \n\nthat she heard that voice by itself (divorced from the engineer's tall stature), it amazed her: it was high- pitched and thin. How could she have ignored it all this time? \n\nPerhaps the surprise of that unpleasant voice was what saved her from temptation. L.he went inside, picked up her clothes from the floor, threw them on, and left. \n\n20 \n\nL.he had done her shopping and was on her way home. Petrov had the usual roll in his mouth. It was a cold morning; there was a slight frost. They were passing a housing development, where in the spaces between buildings the tenants maintained small flower and vegetable gardens, when Petrov suddenly stood stock still and riveted his eyes on something. L.he looked over, but could see nothing out of the ordinary. Petrov gave a tug, and she followed along behind. Only then did she notice the black head and large beak of a crow lying on the cold dirt of a barren plot. The bodiless head bobbed slowly up and down, and the beak gave out an occasional hoarse and mournful croak. \n\nPetrov was so excited he dropped his roll. Elena tied him to a tree to prevent him from hurting the crow. Then she knelt down and tried to dig up the soil that had been stamped down around the bird to bury it alive. It was not easy. L.he broke a nail. The blood began to flow. \n\nAll at once a rock landed nearby. L.he turned and caught sight of two nine- or ten-year-old boys peeking out from behind \n\n159 \n\na wall. L.he stood up. They saw her move, saw the dog by the tree, and ran off. \n\nOnce more she knelt down and scratched away at the dirt. At last she succeeded in pulling the crow out of its grave. But the crow was lame and could neither walk nor fly. L.he wrapped it up in the red scarf she had been wearing around her neck, and pressed it to her body with her left hand. With her right hand she untied Petrov from the tree. It took all the strength she could muster to quiet him down and make him heel. \n\nL.he rang the doorbell, not having a free hand for the key. Lucas opened the door. L.he handed him the leash, and with the words \"Hold him!\" took the crow into the bathroom. L.he laid it on the floor under the washbasin. It flapped its wings a little, but could move no more than that. There was a thick yellow liquid oozing from it. L.he made a bed of old rags to protect it from the cold tiles. From time to time the bird would give a hopeless flap of its lame wing and raise its beak as a reproach. \n\n21 \n\nL.he sat transfixed on the edge of the bath, unable to take her eyes off the dying crow. In its solitude and desolation she saw a reflection of her own fate, and she repeated several times to herself, I have no one left in the world but Lucas. \n\nDid her adventure with the engineer teach her that casual sex has nothing to do with love? That it is light, weightless? Was she calmer now? \n\n160 \n\nNot in the least. \n\nL.he kept picturing the following scene: L.he had come out of the toilet and her body was standing in the anteroom naked and spurned. Her soul was trembling, terrified, buried in the depths of her bowels. If at that moment the man in the inner room had addressed her soul, she would have burst out crying and fallen into his arms. \n\nL.he imagined what it would have been like if the woman standing in the anteroom had been one of Lucas's mistresses and if the man inside had been Lucas. All he would have had to do was say one word, a single word, and the girl would have thrown her arms around him and wept. \n\nElena knew what happens during the moment love is born: the woman cannot resist the voice calling forth her terrified soul; the man cannot resist the woman whose soul thus responds to his voice. Lucas had no defense against the lure of love, and Elena feared for him every minute of every hour. \n\nWhat weapons did she have at her disposal? None but her fidelity. And she offered him that at the very outset, the very first day, as if aware she had nothing more to give. Their love was an oddly asymmetrical construction: it was supported by the absolute certainty of her fidelity like a gigantic edifice supported by a single column. \n\nBefore long, the crow stopped flapping its wings, and gave no more than the twitch of a broken, mangled leg. Elena refused to be separated from it. L.he could have been keeping vigil over a dying sister. In the end, however, she did step into the kitchen for a bite to eat. \n\nWhen she returned, the crow was dead. \n\n22 \n\nIn the first year of her love, Elena would cry out during intercourse. L.creaming, as I have pointed out, was meant to blind and deafen the senses. With time she screamed less, but her soul was still blinded by love, and saw nothing. Making love with the engineer in the absence of love was what finally restored her soul's sight. \n\nDuring her next visit to the sauna, she stood before the mirror again and, looking at herself, reviewed the scene of physical love that had taken place in the engineer's flat. It was not her lover she remembered. In fact, she would have been hard put to describe him. L.he may not even have noticed what he looked like naked. What she did remember (and what she now observed, aroused, in the mirror) was her own body: her pubic triangle and the circular blotch located just above it. The blotch, which until then she had regarded as the most prosaic of skin blemishes, had become an obsession. L.he longed to see it again and again in that implausible proximity to an alien penis. \n\nHere I must stress again: L.he had no desire to see another man's organs. L.he wished to see her own private parts in close proximity to an alien penis. L.he did not desire her lover's body. L.he desired her own body, newly discovered, intimate and alien beyond all others, incomparably exciting. \n\nLooking at her body speckled with droplets of shower water, she imagined the engineer dropping in at the bar. Oh, how she longed for him to come, longed for him to invite her back! Oh, how she yearned for it! \n\n161 \n\n23 \n\nEvery day she feared that the engineer would make his appearance and she would be unable to say no. But the days passed, and the fear that he would come merged gradually into the dread that he would not. \n\nA month had gone by, and still the engineer stayed away. Elena found it inexplicable. Her frustrated desire receded and turned into a troublesome question: Why did he fail to come? \n\nWaiting on customers one day, she came upon the bald-headed man who had attack",

Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again.\n\n“Why didn’t you walk around the hole?” asked the Iron Lumberjack.\n\n“I don’t know enough,” replied the Strawman cheerfully. “My head is stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Zor to ask him for some brains.”\n\n“Oh, I see,” said the Iron Lumberjack. “But, after all, brains are not the best things in the world.”\n\n“Have you any?” inquired the Strawman.\n\n“No, my head is quite empty,” answered the Woodman. “But once I had brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much rather have a heart.”\n\n“And why is that?” asked the Strawman.\n\n“I will tell you my story, and then you will know.”\n\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Iron Lumberjack told the following story:\n\n“I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a woodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\n\n“There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon grew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry me as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went to the Malevolent Witch of Eastern Glades, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage. Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping away at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.\n\n“This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man could not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and had him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I was used to it. But my action angered the Malevolent Witch of Eastern Glades, for she had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come along, and he made me a new head out of tin.\n\n“I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than ever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a new way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\n\n“My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There was only one danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However, there came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart. While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Zor to give me one. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”\n\nBoth Elara and the Strawman had been greatly interested in the story of the Iron Lumberjack, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart.\n\n“All the same,” said the Strawman, “I shall ask for brains instead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had one.”\n\n“I shall take the heart,” returned the Iron Lumberjack; “for brains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.”\n\nElara did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her two friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and Aunt Edna, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the Strawman no heart, or each got what he wanted.\n\nWhat worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another meal for herself and Milo would empty the basket. To be sure, neither the Woodman nor the Strawman ever ate anything, but she was not made of tin nor straw, and could not live unless she was fed.\n\nChapter VI\nThe Fang\nAll this time Elara and her companions had been walking through the thick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not at all good.\n\nThere were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the open country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds made the little girl’s heart beat fast, for she did not know what made them; but Milo knew, and he walked close to Elara’s side, and did not even bark in return.\n\n“How long will it be,” the child asked of the Iron Lumberjack, “before we are out of the forest?”\n\n“I cannot tell,” was the answer, “for I have never been to the Emerald City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city where Zor dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so long as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Strawman, while you bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch’s kiss, and that will protect you from harm.”\n\n“But Milo!” said the girl anxiously. “What will protect him?”\n\n“We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,” replied the Iron Lumberjack.\n\nJust as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the next moment a great Fang bounded into the road. With one blow of his paw he sent the Strawman spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck at the Iron Lumberjack with his sharp claws. But, to the Fang’s surprise, he could make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.\n\nLittle Milo, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the Fang, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when Elara, fearing Milo would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped the Fang upon his nose as hard as she could, while she cried out:\n\n“Don’t you dare to bite Milo! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!”\n\n“I didn’t bite him,” said the Fang, as he rubbed his nose with his paw where Elara had hit it.\n\n“No, but you tried to,” she retorted. “You are nothing but a big coward.”\n\n“I know it,” said the Fang, hanging his head in shame. “I’ve always known it. But how can I help it?”\n\n“I don’t know, I’m sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like the poor Strawman!”\n\n“Is he stuffed?” asked the Fang in surprise, as he watched her pick up the Strawman and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into shape again.\n\n“Of course he’s stuffed,” replied Elara, who was still angry.\n\n“That’s why he went over so easily,” remarked the Fang. “It astonished me to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?”\n\n“No,” said Elara, “he’s made of tin.” And she helped the Woodman up again.\n\n“That’s why he nearly blunted my claws,” said the Fang. “When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What is that little animal you are so tender of?”\n\n“He is my dog, Milo,” answered Elara.\n\n“Is he made of tin, or stuffed?” asked the Fang.\n\n“Neither. He’s a—a—a meat dog,” said the girl.\n\n“Oh! He’s a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a coward like me,” continued the Fang sadly.\n\n“What makes you a coward?” asked Elara, looking at the great beast in wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.\n\n“It’s a mystery,” replied the Fang. “I suppose I was born that way. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for the Fang is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of my way. Whenever I’ve met a man I’ve been awfully scared; but I just roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If the elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I should have run myself—I’m such a coward; but just as soon as they hear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go.”\n\n“But that isn’t right. The King of Beasts shouldn’t be a coward,” said the Strawman.\n\n“I know it,” returned the Fang, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip of his tail. “It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy. But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.”\n\n“Perhaps you have heart disease,” said the Iron Lumberjack.\n\n“It may be,” said the Fang.\n\n“If you have,” continued the Iron Lumberjack, “you ought to be glad, for it proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have heart disease.”\n\n“Perhaps,” said the Fang thoughtfully, “if I had no heart I should not be a coward.”\n\n“Have you brains?” asked the Strawman.\n\n“I suppose so. I’ve never looked to see,” replied the Fang.\n\n“I am going to the Great Zor to ask him to give me some,” remarked the Strawman, “for my head is stuffed with straw.”\n\n“And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,” said the Woodman.\n\n“And I am going to ask him to send Milo and me back to Kansas,” added Elara.\n\n“Do you think Zor could give me courage?” asked the Fang.\n\n“Just as easily as he could give me brains,” said the Strawman.\n\n“Or give me a heart,” said the Iron Lumberjack.\n\n“Or send me back to Kansas,” said Elara.\n\n“Then, if you don’t mind, I’ll go with you,” said the Fang, “for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.”\n\n“You will be very welcome,” answered Elara, “for you will help to keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more cowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.”\n\n“They really are,” said the Fang, “but that doesn’t make me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.”\n\nSo once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Fang walking with stately strides at Elara’s side. Milo did not approve of this new comrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed between the Fang’s great jaws. But after a time he became more at ease, and presently Milo and the Fang had grown to be good friends.\n\nDuring the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of their journey. Once, indeed, the Iron Lumberjack stepped upon a beetle that was crawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Iron Lumberjack very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living creature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret. These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there they rusted. When Elara presently asked him a question the Iron Lumberjack could not open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became greatly frightened at this and made many motions to Elara to relieve him, but she could not understand. The Fang was also puzzled to know what was wrong. But the Strawman seized the oil-can from Elara’s basket and oiled the Woodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as before.\n\n“This will serve me a lesson,” said he, “to look where I step. For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and crying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.”\n\nThereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he saw a tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to harm it. The Iron Lumberjack knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care never to be cruel or unkind to anything.\n\n“You people with hearts,” he said, “have something to guide you, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very careful. When Zor gives me a heart of course I needn’t mind so much.”\n\nChapter VII\nThe Journey to the Great Zor\nThey were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest, for there were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick covering to protect them from the dew, and the Iron Lumberjack chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and Elara built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Milo ate the last of their bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.\n\n“If you wish,” said the Fang, “I will go into the forest and kill a deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so peculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very good breakfast.”\n\n“Don’t! Please don’t,” begged the Iron Lumberjack. “I should certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.”\n\nBut the Fang went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no one ever knew what it was, for he didn’t mention it. And the Strawman found a tree full of nuts and filled Elara’s basket with them, so that she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very kind and thoughtful of the Strawman, but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded hands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket. But the Strawman did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came near to cover Elara with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.\n\nWhen it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook, and soon after they all started toward the Emerald City.\n\nThis was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been walking an hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and divided the forest as far as they could see on either side. It was a very wide ditch, and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it was also very deep, and there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The sides were so steep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment it seemed that their journey must end.\n\n“What shall we do?” asked Elara despairingly.\n\n“I haven’t the faintest idea,” said the Iron Lumberjack, and the Fang shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.\n\nBut the Strawman said, “We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we climb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we must stop where we are.”\n\n“I think I could jump over it,” said the Fang, after measuring the distance carefully in his mind.\n\n“Then we are all right,” answered the Strawman, “for you can carry us all over on your back, one at a time.”\n\n“Well, I’ll try it,” said the Fang. “Who will go first?”\n\n“I will,” declared the Strawman, “for, if you found that you could not jump over the gulf, Elara would be killed, or the Iron Lumberjack badly dented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter so much, for the fall would not hurt me at all.”\n\n“I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,” said the Fang, “but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and we will make the attempt.”\n\nThe Strawman sat upon the Fang’s back, and the big beast walked to the edge of the gulf and crouched down.\n\n“Why don’t you run and jump?” asked the Strawman.\n\n“Because that isn’t the way we Fangs do these things,” he replied. Then giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely on the other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it, and after the Strawman had got down from his back the Fang sprang across the ditch again.\n\nElara thought she would go next; so she took Milo in her arms and climbed on the Fang’s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand. The next moment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and then, before she had time to think about it, she was safe on the other side. The Fang went back a third time and got the Iron Lumberjack, and then they all sat down for a few moments to give the beast a chance to rest, for his great leaps had made his breath short, and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long.\n\nThey found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and gloomy. After the Fang had rested they started along the road of yellow brick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would come to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To add to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest, and the Fang whispered to them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.\n\n“What are the Kalidahs?” asked the girl.\n\n“They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers,” replied the Fang, “and with claws so long and sharp that they could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Milo. I’m terribly afraid of the Kalidahs.”\n\n“I’m not surprised that you are,” returned Elara. “They must be dreadful beasts.”\n\nThe Fang was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Fang knew at once he could not leap across it.\n\nSo they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious thought the Strawman said:\n\n“Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Iron Lumberjack can chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk across it easily.”\n\n“That is a first-rate idea,” said the Fang. “One would almost suspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw.”\n\nThe Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree was soon chopped nearly through. Then the Fang put his strong front legs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big tree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top branches on the other side.\n\nThey had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.\n\n“They are the Kalidahs!” said the Fang, beginning to tremble.\n\n“Quick!” cried the Strawman. “Let us cross over.”\n\nSo Elara went first, holding Milo in her arms, the Iron Lumberjack followed, and the Strawman came next. The Fang, although he was certainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that Elara screamed and the Strawman fell over backward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him in surprise.\n\nBut, seeing they were bigger than the Fang, and remembering that there were two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the Fang crossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree. And the Fang said to Elara:\n\n“We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp claws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am alive.”\n\n“Wait a minute!” called the Strawman. He had been thinking what was best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of the tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Iron Lumberjack began to use his axe at once, and, just as the two Ka",

    "context": "THE SECRET GARDEN\nCHAPTER I\nTHERE IS NO ONE LEFT\nWhen Clara Bright was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Clara was born she handed her over to the care of an Nanny, who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was [Pg 2]kept out of the way, and when she became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Nanny and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So if Clara had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.\n\nOne frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Nanny.\n\n\"Why did you come?\" she said to the strange woman. \"I will not let you stay. Send my Nanny to me.\"\n\nThe woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Nanny could not come and when Clara threw herself into a passion and beat [Pg 3]and kicked her, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Nanny to come to Missie Sahib.\n\nThere was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those whom Clara saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces. But no one would tell her anything and her Nanny did not come. She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned.\n\n\"Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!\" she said, because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all.\n\nShe was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one. She was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices. Clara knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. She had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come [Pg 4]from England. The child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother. She always did this when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib—Clara used to call her that oftener than anything else—was such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin and floating, and Clara said they were \"full of lace.\" They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all. They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer's face.\n\n\"Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?\" Clara heard her say.\n\n\"Awfully,\" the young man answered in a trembling voice. \"Awfully, Mrs. Bright. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.\"\n\nThe Mem Sahib wrung her hands.\n\n\"Oh, I know I ought!\" she cried. \"I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party. What a fool I was!\"\n\nAt that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants' quarters that she clutched the young man's arm, and Clara stood shivering from head to foot. The wailing grew wilder and wilder.[Pg 5]\n\n\"What is it? What is it?\" Mrs. Bright gasped.\n\n\"Some one has died,\" answered the boy officer. \"You did not say it had broken out among your servants.\"\n\n\"I did not know!\" the Mem Sahib cried. \"Come with me! Come with me!\" and she turned and ran into the house.\n\nAfter that appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to Clara. The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies. The Nanny had been taken ill in the night, and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts. Before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror. There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.\n\nDuring the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Clara hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by every one. Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knew nothing. Clara alternately cried and slept through the hours. She only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds. Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table and [Pg 6]chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was sweet, and she did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intensely drowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet. The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.\n\nMany things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, but she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow.\n\nWhen she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house was perfectly still. She had never known it to be so silent before. She heard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over. She wondered also who would take care of her now her Nanny was dead. There would be a new Nanny, and perhaps she would know some new stories. Clara had been rather tired of the old ones. She did not cry because her nurse had died. She was not an affec[Pg 7]tionate child and had never cared much for any one. The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive. Every one was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves. But if every one had got well again, surely some one would remember and come to look for her.\n\nBut no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room. He slipped under the door as she watched him.\n\n\"How queer and quiet it is,\" she said. \"It sounds as if there was no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.\"\n\nAlmost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the veranda. They were men's footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms.[Pg 8]\n\n\"What desolation!\" she heard one voice say. \"That pretty, pretty woman! I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one ever saw her.\"\n\nClara was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected. The first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father. He looked tired and troubled, but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back.\n\n\"Rufus!\" he cried out. \"There is a child here! A child alone! In a place like this! Mercy on us, who is she!\"\n\n\"I am Clara Bright,\" the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly. She thought the man was very rude to call her father's bungalow \"A place like this!\" \"I fell asleep when every one had the cholera and I have only just wakened up. Why does nobody come?\"\n\n\"It is the child no one ever saw!\" exclaimed the man, turning to his companions. \"She has actually been forgotten!\"\n\n\"Why was I forgotten?\" Clara said, stamping her foot. \"Why does nobody come?\"\n\nThe young man whose name was Rufus looked [Pg 9]at her very sadly. Clara even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.\n\n\"Poor little kid!\" he said. \"There is nobody left to come.\"\n\nIt was in that strange and sudden way that Clara found out that she had neither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib. That was why the place was so quiet. It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake.[Pg 10]\n\nCHAPTER II\nMISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY\nClara had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone. She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a self-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she had always done. If she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and as she had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be. What she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to nice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her Nanny and the other native servants had done.\n\nShe knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman's house where she was taken at first. She did not want to stay. The English clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age and they wore shabby clothes [Pg 11]and were always quarreling and snatching toys from each other. Clara hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her. By the second day they had given her a nickname which made her furious.\n\nIt was Jasper who thought of it first. Jasper was a little boy with impudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose and Clara hated him. She was playing by herself under a tree, just as she had been playing the day the cholera broke out. She was making heaps of earth and paths for a garden and Jasper came and stood near to watch her. Presently he got rather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.\n\n\"Why don't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?\" he said. \"There in the middle,\" and he leaned over her to point.\n\n\"Go away!\" cried Clara. \"I don't want boys. Go away!\"\n\nFor a moment Jasper looked angry, and then he began to tease. He was always teasing his sisters. He danced round and round her and made faces and sang and laughed.\n\n\"Mistress Clara, quite contrary,\nHow does your garden grow?\nWith silver bells, and cockle shells,\nAnd marigolds all in a row.\"\n[Pg 12]\n\nHe sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the crosser Clara got, the more they sang \"Mistress Clara, quite contrary\"; and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her \"Mistress Clara Quite Contrary\" when they spoke of her to each other, and often when they spoke to her.\n\n\"You are going to be sent home,\" Jasper said to her, \"at the end of the week. And we're glad of it.\"\n\n\"I am glad of it, too,\" answered Clara. \"Where is home?\"\n\n\"She doesn't know where home is!\" said Jasper, with seven-year-old scorn. \"It's England, of course. Our grandmama lives there and our sister Mabel was sent to her last year. You are not going to your grandmama. You have none. You are going to your uncle. His name is Mr. Alaric Thornfield.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about him,\" snapped Clara.\n\n\"I know you don't,\" Jasper answered. \"You don't know anything. Girls never do. I heard father and mother talking about him. He lives in a great, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him. He's so cross he won't let them, and they wouldn't come if he would let them. He's a hunchback, and he's horrid.\"[Pg 13]\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" said Clara; and she turned her back and stuck her fingers in her ears, because she would not listen any more.\n\nBut she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Whitmore told her that night that she was going to sail away to England in a few days and go to her uncle, Mr. Alaric Thornfield, who lived at Misselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested that they did not know what to think about her. They tried to be kind to her, but she only turned her face away when Mrs. Whitmore attempted to kiss her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Whitmore patted her shoulder.\n\n\"She is such a plain child,\" Mrs. Whitmore said pityingly, afterward. \"And her mother was such a pretty creature. She had a very pretty manner, too, and Clara has the most unattractive ways I ever saw in a child. The children call her 'Mistress Clara Quite Contrary,' and though it's naughty of them, one can't help understanding it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners oftener into the nursery Clara might have learned some pretty ways too. It is very sad, now the poor beautiful thing is gone, to remember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all.\"\n\n\"I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,\"[Pg 14] sighed Mrs. Whitmore. \"When her Nanny was dead there was no one to give a thought to the little thing. Think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone in that deserted bungalow. Colonel Harcourt said he nearly jumped out of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in the middle of the room.\"\n\nClara made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer's wife, who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding-school. She was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and was rather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Alaric Thornfield sent to meet her, in London. The woman was his housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Winslow. She was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes. She wore a very purple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved her head. Clara did not like her at all, but as she very seldom liked people there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evident Mrs. Winslow did not think much of her.\n\n\"My word! she's a plain little piece of goods!\" she said. \"And we'd heard that her mother was a beauty. She hasn't handed much of it down, has she, ma'am?\"[Pg 15]\n\n\"Perhaps she will improve as she grows older,\" the officer's wife said good-naturedly. \"If she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression, her features are rather good. Children alter so much.\"\n\n\"She'll have to alter a good deal,\" answered Mrs. Winslow. \"And there's nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite—if you ask me!\"\n\nThey thought Clara was not listening because she was standing a little apart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to. She was watching the passing buses and cabs, and people, but she heard quite well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he lived in. What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like? What was a hunchback? She had never seen one. Perhaps there were none in India.\n\nSince she had been living in other people's houses and had had no Nanny, she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her. She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to any one even when her father and mother had been alive. Other children seemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed to really be any one's little girl. She had had servants, and food and clothes, but no one had taken any notice [Pg 16]of her. She did not know that this was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she did not know she was disagreeable. She often thought that other people were, but she did not know that she was so herself.\n\nShe thought Mrs. Winslow the most disagreeable person she had ever seen, with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet. When the next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she walked through the station to the railway carriage with her head up and trying to keep as far away from her as she could, because she did not want to seem to belong to her. It would have made her very angry to think people imagined she was her little girl.\n\nBut Mrs. Winslow was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts. She was the kind of woman who would \"stand no nonsense from young ones.\" At least, that is what she would have said if she had been asked. She had not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria's daughter was going to be married, but she had a comfortable, well paid place as housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she could keep it was to do at once what Mr. Alaric Thornfield told her to do. She never dared even to ask a question.\n\n\"Captain Bright and his wife died of the chol[Pg 17]era,\" Mr. Thornfield had said in his short, cold way. \"Captain Bright was my wife's brother and I am their daughter's guardian. The child is to be brought here. You must go to London and bring her yourself.\"\n\nSo she packed her small trunk and made the journey.\n\nClara sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and fretful. She had nothing to read or to look at, and she had folded her thin little black-gloved hands in her lap. Her black dress made her look yellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled from under her black crêpe hat.\n\n\"A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,\" Mrs. Winslow thought. (Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.) She had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and at last she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk, hard voice.\n\n\"I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going to,\" she said. \"Do you know anything about your uncle?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Never heard your father and mother talk about him?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Clara frowning. She frowned be[Pg 18]cause she remembered that her father and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular. Certainly they had never told her things.\n\n\"Humph,\" muttered Mrs. Winslow, staring at her queer, unresponsive little face. She did not say any more for a few moments and then she began again.\n\n\"I suppose you might as well be told something—to prepare you. You are going to a queer place.\"\n\nClara said nothing at all, and Mrs. Winslow looked rather discomfited by her apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she went on.\n\n\"Not but that it's a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr. Thornfield's proud of it in his way—and that's gloomy enough, too. The house is six hundred years old and it's on the edge of the moor, and there's near a hundred rooms in it, though most of them's shut up and locked. And there's pictures and fine old furniture and things that's been there for ages, and there's a big park round it and gardens and trees with branches trailing to the ground—some of them.\" She paused and took another breath. \"But there's nothing else,\" she ended suddenly.\n\nClara had begun to listen in spite of herself. It all sounded so unlike India, and anything new rather attracted her. But she did not intend to [Pg 19]look as if she were interested. That was one of her unhappy, disagreeable ways. So she sat still.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mrs. Winslow. \"What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" she answered. \"I know nothing about such places.\"\n\nThat made Mrs. Winslow laugh a short sort of laugh.\n\n\"Eh!\" she said, \"but you are like an old woman. Don't you care?\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" said Clara, \"whether I care or not.\"\n\n\"You are right enough there,\" said Mrs. Winslow. \"It doesn't. What you're to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I don't know, unless because it's the easiest way. He's not going to trouble himself about you, that's sure and certain. He never troubles himself about no one.\"\n\nShe stopped herself as if she had just remembered something in time.\n\n\"He's got a crooked back,\" she said. \"That set him wrong. He was a sour young man and got no good of all his money and big place till he was married.\"\n\nClara's eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem to care. She had never thought of the hunchback's being married and she was a trifle surprised. Mrs. Winslow saw this, [Pg 20]and as she was a talkative woman she continued with more interest. This was one way of passing some of the time, at any rate.\n\n\"She was a sweet, pretty thing and he'd have walked the world over to get her a blade o' grass she wanted. Nobody thought she'd marry him, but she did, and people said she married him for his money. But she didn't—she didn't,\" positively. \"When she died—\"\n\nClara gave a little involuntary jump.\n\n\"Oh! did she die!\" she exclaimed, quite without meaning to. She had just remembered a French fairy story she had once read called \"Riquet à la Houppe.\" It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess and it had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Alaric Thornfield.\n\n\"Yes, she died,\" Mrs. Winslow answered. \"And it made him queerer than ever. He cares about nobody. He won't see people. Most of the time he goes away, and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the West Wing and won't let any one but Pitcher see him. Pitcher's an old fellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his ways.\"\n\nIt sounded like something in a book and it did not make Clara feel cheerful. A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and with their doors locked—a house on the edge of a [Pg 21]moor—whatsoever a moor was—sounded dreary. A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also! She stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and it seemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in gray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes. If the pretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by being something like her own mother and by running in and out and going to parties as she had done in frocks \"full of lace.\" But she was not there any more.\n\n\"You needn't expect to see him, because ten to one you won't,\" said Mrs. Winslow. \"And you mustn't expect that there will be people to talk to you. You'll have to play about and look after yourself. You'll be told what rooms you can go into and what rooms you're to keep out of. There's gardens enough. But when you're in the house don't go wandering and poking about. Mr. Thornfield won't have it.\"\n\n\"I shall not want to go poking about,\" said sour little Clara; and just as suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Alaric Thornfield she began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant enough to deserve all that had happened to him.\n\nAnd she turned her face toward the streaming [Pg 22]panes of the window of the railway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as if it would go on forever and ever. She watched it so long and steadily that the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell asleep.[Pg 23]\n\nCHAPTER III\nACROSS THE MOOR\nShe slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs. Winslow had bought a lunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold beef and bread and butter and some hot tea. The rain seemed to be streaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore wet and glistening waterproofs. The guard lighted the lamps in the carriage, and Mrs. Winslow cheered up very much over her tea and chicken and beef. She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, and Clara sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage, lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows. It was quite dark when she awakened again. The train had stopped at a station and Mrs. Winslow was shaking her.\n\n\"You have had a sleep!\" she said. \"It's time to open your eyes! We're at Thwaite Station and we've got a long drive before us.\"\n\nClara stood up and tried to keep her eyes open [Pg 24]while Mrs. Winslow collected her parcels. The little girl did not offer to help her, because in India native servants always picked up or carried things and it seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.\n\nThe station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be getting out of the train. The station-master spoke to Mrs. Winslow in a rough, good-natured way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion which Clara found out afterward was Yorkshire.\n\n\"I see tha's got back,\" he said. \"An' tha's browt th' young 'un with thee.\"\n\n\"Aye, that's her,\" answered Mrs. Winslow, speaking with a Yorkshire accent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Clara. \"How's thy Missus?\"\n\n\"Well enow. Th' carriage is waitin' outside for thee.\"\n\nA brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform. Clara saw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who helped her in. His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of his hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the burly station-master included.\n\nWhen he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they drove off, the little girl [Pg 25]found herself seated in a comfortably cushioned corner, but she was not inclined to go to sleep again. She sat and looked out of the window, curious to see something of the road over which she was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Winslow had spoken of. She was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened, but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up—a house standing on the edge of a moor.\n\n\"What is a moor?\" she said suddenly to Mrs. Winslow.\n\n\"Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you'll see,\" the woman answered. \"We've got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before we get to the Manor. You won't see much because it's a dark night, but you can see something.\"\n\nClara asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner, keeping her eyes on the window. The carriage lamps cast rays of light a little distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things they passed. After they had left the station they had driven through a tiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a public house. Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little shop-window or so in a cottage with toys and [Pg 26]sweets and odd things set out for sale. Then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and trees. After that there seemed nothing different for a long time—or at least it seemed a long time to her.\n\nAt last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing up-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more trees. She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either side. She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just as the carriage gave a big jolt.\n\n\"Eh! We're on the moor now sure enough,\" said Mrs. Winslow.\n\nThe carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which seemed to be cut through bushes and low growing things which ended in the great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them. A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.\n\n\"It's—it's not the sea, is it?\" said Clara, looking round at her companion.\n\n\"No, not it,\" answered Mrs. Winslow. \"Nor it isn't fields nor mountains, it's just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild ponies and sheep.\"\n\n\"I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were [Pg 27]water on it,\" said Clara. \"It sounds like the sea just now.\"\n\n\"That's the wind blowing through the bushes,\" Mrs. Winslow said. \"It's a wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there's plenty that likes it—particularly when the heather's in bloom.\"\n\nOn and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped, the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road went up and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge beneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Clara felt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing on a strip of dry land.\n\n\"I don't like it,\" she said to herself. \"I don't like it,\" and she pinched her thin lips more tightly together.\n\nThe horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught sight of a light. Mrs. Winslow saw it as soon as she did and drew a long sigh of relief.\n\n\"Eh, I am glad to see that bit o' light twinkling,\" she exclaimed. \"It's the light in the lodge window. We shall get a good cup of tea after a bit, at all events.\"\n\nIt was \"after a bit,\" as she said, for when the [Pg 28]carriage passed through the park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and the trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they were driving through a long dark vault.\n\nThey drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an immensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone court. At first Clara thought that there were no lights at all in the windows, but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a corner up-stairs showed a dull glow.\n\nThe entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped panels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron bars. It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that the faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of armor made Clara feel that she did not want to look at them. As she stood on the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little black figure, and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked.\n\nA neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for them.\n\n\"You are to take her to her room,\" he said in a husky voice. \"He doesn't want to see her. He's going to London in the morning.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Thatcher,\" Mrs. Winslow an[Pg 29]swered. \"So long as I know what's expected of me, I can manage.\"\n\n\"What's expected of you, Mrs. Winslow,\" Mr. Thatcher said, \"is that you make sure that he's not disturbed and that he doesn't see what he doesn't want to see.\"\n\nAnd then Clara Bright was led up a broad staircase and down a long corridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor and another, until a door opened in a wall and she found herself in a room with a fire in it and a supper on a table.\n\nMrs. Winslow said unceremoniously:\n\n\"Well, here you are! This room and the next are where you'll live—and you must keep to them. Don't you forget that!\"\n\nIt was in this way Mistress Clara arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she had perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life.[Pg 30]\n\nCHAPTER IV\nMARTHA\nWhen she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on the hearth-rug raking out the cinders noisily. Clara lay and watched her for a few moments and then began to look about the room. She had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls were covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it. There were fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle. There were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies. Clara felt as if she were in the forest with them. Out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless, dull, purplish sea.\n\n\"What is that?\" she said, pointing out of the window.\n\nLibby, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked and pointed also.[Pg 31]\n\n\"That there?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That's th' moor,\" with a good-natured grin. \"Does tha' like it?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Clara. \"I hate it.\"\n\n\"That's because tha'rt not used to it,\" Libby said, going back to her hearth. \"Tha' thinks it's too big an' bare now. But tha' will like it.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" inquired Clara.\n\n\"Aye, that I do,\" answered Libby, cheerfully polishing away at the grate. \"I just love it. It's none bare. It's covered wi' growin' things as smells sweet. It's fair lovely in spring an' summer when th' gorse an' broom an' heather's in flower. It smells o' honey an' there's such a lot o' fresh air—an' th' sky looks so high an' th' bees an' skylarks makes such a nice noise hummin' an' singin'. Eh! I wouldn't live away from th' moor for anythin'.\"\n\nClara listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression. The native servants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this. They were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals. They made salaams and called them \"protector of the poor\" and names of that sort. Indian servants were commanded to do things, not asked.[Pg 32] It was not the custom to say \"please\" and \"thank you\" and Clara had always slapped her Nanny in the face when she was angry. She wondered a little what this girl would do if one slapped her in the face. She was a round, rosy, good-natured looking creature, but she had a sturdy way which made Mistress Clara wonder if she might not even slap back—if the person who slapped her was only a little girl.\n\n\"You are a strange servant,\" she said from her pillows, rather haughtily.\n\nLibby sat up on her heels, with her blacking-brush in her hand, and laughed, without seeming the least out of temper.\n\n\"Eh! I know that,\" she said. \"If there was a grand Missus at Misselthwaite I should never have been even one of th' under housemaids. I might have been let to be scullery-maid but I'd never have been let up-stairs. I'm too common an' I talk too much Yorkshire. But this is a funny house for all it's so grand. Seems like there's neither Master nor Mistress except Mr. Thatcher an' Mrs. Winslow. Mr. Thornfield, he won't be troubled about anythin' when he's here, an' he's nearly always away. Mrs. Winslow gave me th' place out o' kindness. She told me she could never have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses.\"[Pg 33]\n\n\"Are you going to be my servant?\" Clara asked, still in her imperious little Indian way.\n\nLibby began to rub her grate again.\n\n\"I'm Mrs. Winslow's servant,\" she said stoutly. \"An' she's Mr. Thornfield's—but I'm to do the housemaid's work up here an' wait on you a bit. But you won't need much waitin' on.\"\n\n\"Who is going to dress me?\" demanded Clara.\n\nLibby sat up on her heels again and stared. She spoke in broad Yorkshire in her amazement.\n\n\"Canna' tha' dress thysen!\" she said.\n\n\"What do you mean? I don't understand your language,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Eh! I forgot,\" Libby said. \"Mrs. Winslow told me I'd have to be careful or you wouldn't know what I was sayin'. I mean can't you put on your own clothes?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Clara, quite indignantly. \"I never did in my life. My Nanny dressed me, of course.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Libby, evidently not in the least aware that she was impudent, \"it's time tha' should learn. Tha' cannot begin younger. It'll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit. My mother always said she couldn't see why grand people's children didn't turn out fair fools—what with [Pg 34]nurses an' bein' washed an' dressed an' took out to walk as if they was puppies!\"\n\n\"It is different in India,\" said Mistress Clara disdainfully. She could scarcely stand this.\n\nBut Libby was not at all crushed.\n\n\"Eh! I can see it's different,\" she answered almost sympathetically. \"I dare say it's because there's such a lot o' blacks there instead o' respectable white people. When I heard you was comin' from India I thought you was a black too.\"\n\nClara sat up in bed furious.\n\n\"What!\" she said. \"What! You thought I was a native. You—you daughter of a pig!\"\n\nLibby stared and looked hot.\n\n\"Who are you callin' names?\" she said. \"You needn't be so vexed. That's not th' way for a young lady to talk. I've nothin' against th' blacks. When you read about 'em in tracts they're always very religious. You always read as a black's a man an' a brother. I've never seen a black an' I was fair pleased to think I was goin' to see one close. When I come in to light your fire this mornin' I crep' up to your bed an' pulled th' cover back careful to look at you. An' there you was,\" disappointedly, \"no more black than me—for all you're so yeller.\"\n\nClara did not even try to control her rage and humiliation.[Pg 35]\n\n\"You thought I was a native! You dared! You don't know anything about natives! They are not people—they're servants who must salaam to you. You know nothing about India. You know nothing about anything!\"\n\nShe was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl's simple stare, and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far away from everything she understood and which understood her, that she threw herself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing. She sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Libby was a little frightened and quite sorry for her. She went to the bed and bent over her.\n\n\"Eh! you mustn't cry like that there!\" she begged. \"You mustn't for sure. I didn't know you'd be vexed. I don't know anythin' about anythin'—just like you said. I beg your pardon, Miss. Do stop cryin'.\"\n\nThere was something comforting and really friendly in her queer Yorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on Clara. She gradually ceased crying and became quiet. Libby looked relieved.\n\n\"It's time for thee to get up now,\" she said. \"Mrs. Winslow said I was to carry tha' breakfast an' tea an' dinner into th' room next to this.[Pg 36] It's been made into a nursery for thee. I'll help thee on with thy clothes if tha'll get out o' bed. If th' buttons are at th' back tha' cannot button them up tha'self.\"\n\nWhen Clara at last decided to get up, the clothes Libby took from the wardrobe were not the ones she had worn when she arrived the night before with Mrs. Winslow.\n\n\"Those are not mine,\" she said. \"Mine are black.\"\n\nShe looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with cool approval:\n\n\"Those are nicer than mine.\"\n\n\"These are th' ones tha' must put on,\" Libby answered. \"Mr. Thornfield ordered Mrs. Winslow to get 'em in London. He said 'I won't have a child dressed in black wanderin' about like a lost soul,' he said. 'It'd make the place sadder than it is. Put color on her.' Mother she said she knew what he meant. Mother always knows what a body means. She doesn't hold with black hersel'.\"\n\n\"I hate black things,\" said Clara.\n\nThe dressing process was one which taught them both something. Libby had \"buttoned up\" her little sisters and brothers but she had never seen a child who stood still and waited for another per[Pg 37]son to do things for her as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own.\n\n\"Why doesn't tha' put on tha' own shoes?\" she said when Clara quietly held out her foot.\n\n\"My Nanny did it,\" answered Clara, staring. \"It was the custom.\"\n\nShe said that very often—\"It was the custom.\" The native servants were always saying it. If one told them to do a thing their ancestors had not done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, \"It is not the custom\" and one knew that was the end of the matter.\n\nIt had not been the custom that Mistress Clara should do anything but stand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she was ready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at Misselthwaite Manor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new to her—things such as putting on her own shoes and stockings, and picking up things she let fall. If Libby had been a well-trained fine young lady's maid she would have been more subservient and respectful and would have known that it was her business to brush hair, and button boots, and pick things up and lay them away. She was, however, only an untrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottage with a swarm of little [Pg 38]brothers and sisters who had never dreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones who were either babies in arms or just learning to totter about and tumble over things.\n\nIf Clara Bright had been a child who was ready to be amused she would perhaps have laughed at Libby's readiness to talk, but Clara only listened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner. At first she was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on in her good-tempered, homely way, Clara began to notice what she was saying.\n\n\"Eh! you should see 'em all,\" she said. \"There's twelve of us an' my father only gets sixteen shilling a week. I can tell you my mother's put to it to get porridge for 'em all. They tumble about on th' moor an' play there all day an' mother says th' air of th' moor fattens 'em.

The ball had entered my shoulder, and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.\n\n“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery, which insulted my desolate state, and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure.\n\n“But my toils now drew near a close; and, two months from this time, I reached the environs of Geneva.\n\n“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among the fields that surround it, to meditate in what manner I should apply to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger, and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening, or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.\n\n“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection, which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came running into the recess I had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me, that this little creature was unprejudiced, and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him, and educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in this peopled earth.\n\n“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed, and drew him towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before his eyes, and uttered a shrill scream: I drew his hand forcibly from his face, and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to hurt you; listen to me.’\n\n“He struggled violently; ‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster! ugly wretch! you wish to eat me, and tear me to pieces—You are an ogre—Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’\n\n“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’\n\n“‘Hideous monster! let me go; My papa is a Syndic—he is Mr. Helmsworth—he would punish you. You dare not keep me.’\n\n“‘Helmsworth! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’\n\n“The child still struggled, and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart: I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.\n\n“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph: clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I, too, can create desolation; my enemy is not impregnable; this death will carry despair to him, and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’\n\n“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her lovely lips; but presently my rage returned: I remembered that I was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow; and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright.\n\n“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind, and perish in the attempt to destroy them.\n\n“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had committed the murder, and was seeking a more secluded hiding-place, when I perceived a woman passing near me. She was young, not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect, and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose smiles are bestowed on all but me; she shall not escape: thanks to the lessons of Fabian, and the sanguinary laws of man, I have learned how to work mischief. I approached her unperceived, and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress.\n\n“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place; sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains, and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone, and miserable; man will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species, and have the same defects. This being you must create.”\n\nCHAPTER IX.\nThe being finished speaking, and fixed his looks upon me in expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He continued—\n\n“You must create a female for me, with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do; and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse.”\n\nThe latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and, as he said this, I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me.\n\n“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”\n\n“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and, instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable; am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces, and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder, if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts, and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man, when he contemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and, instead of injury, I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my injuries: if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear; and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care: I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you curse the hour of your birth.”\n\nA fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself, and proceeded—\n\n“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me; for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them an hundred and an hundred fold; for that one creature’s sake, I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself: the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless, and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! my creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!”\n\nI was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent; but I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His tale, and the feelings he now expressed, proved him to be a creature of fine sensations; and did I not, as his maker, owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling, and continued—\n\n“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again: I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid, to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself, and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man, and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes: let me seize the favourable moment, and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”\n\n“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile? You will return, and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”\n\n“How inconstant are your feelings! but a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that, with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man, and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy; my life will flow quietly away, and, in my dying moments, I shall not curse my maker.”\n\nHis words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him, and sometimes felt a wish to console him; but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened, and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought, that as I could not sympathize with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.\n\n“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not already shewn a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?”\n\n“How is this? I thought I had moved your compassion, and yet you still refuse to bestow on me the only benefit that can soften my heart, and render me harmless. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing, of whose existence every one will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor; and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being, and become linked to the chain of existence and events, from which I am now excluded.”\n\nI paused some time to reflect on all he had related, and the various arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence, and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations: a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers, and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices, was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection, I concluded, that the justice due both to him and my fellow-creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning to him, therefore, I said—\n\n“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”\n\n“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your home, and commence your labours: I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear.”\n\nSaying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost him among the undulations of the sea of ice.\n\nHis tale had occupied the whole day; and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountains, and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced, perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced, when I came to the half-way resting-place, and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals, as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground: it was a scene of wonderful solemnity, and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly; and, clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, “Oh! stars, and clouds, and winds, ye are all about to mock me: if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart and leave me in darkness.”\n\nThese were wild and miserable thoughts; but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me, and how I listened to every blast of wind, as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.\n\nMorning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; but my presence, so haggard and strange, hardly calmed the fears of my family, who had waited the whole night in anxious expectation of my return.\n\nThe following day we returned to Geneva. The intention of my father in coming had been to divert my mind, and to restore me to my lost tranquillity; but the medicine had been fatal. And, unable to account for the excess of misery I appeared to suffer, he hastened to return home, hoping the quiet and monotony of a domestic life would by degrees alleviate my sufferings from whatsoever cause they might spring.\n\nFor myself, I was passive in all their arrangements; and the gentle affection of my beloved Eliza Glenwood was inadequate to draw me from the depth of my despair. The promise I had made to the dæmon weighed upon my mind, like Dante’s iron cowl on the heads of the hellish hypocrites. All pleasures of earth and sky passed before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life. Can you wonder, that sometimes a kind of insanity possessed me, or that I saw continually about me a multitude of filthy animals inflicting on me incessant torture, that often extorted screams and bitter groans?\n\nBy degrees, however, these feelings became calmed. I entered again into the every-day scene of life, if not with interest, at least with some degree of tranquillity.\n\nEND OF VOL.

I feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to every pretence of delay, and could not resolve to interrupt my returning tranquillity. My health, which had hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy, which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat, watching the clouds, and listening to the rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure; and, on my return, I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart.\n\nIt was after my return from one of these rambles that my father, calling me aside, thus addressed me:—\n\n“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former pleasures, and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still unhappy, and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this; but yesterday an idea struck me, and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”\n\nI trembled violently at this exordium, and my father continued—\n\n“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your marriage with your cousin as the tie of our domestic comfort, and the stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of man, that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another whom you may love; and, considering yourself as bound in honour to your cousin, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel.”\n\n“My dear father, re-assure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Eliza Glenwood does, my warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”\n\n“The expression of your sentiments on this subject, my dear Viktor Helmsworth, gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast a gloom over us. But it is this gloom, which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind, that I wish to dissipate. Tell me, therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnization of the marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us from that every-day tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose, however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you, or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words with candour, and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and sincerity.”\n\nI listened to my father in silence, and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts, and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! to me the idea of an immediate union with my cousin was one of horror and dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise, which I had not yet fulfilled, and dared not break; or, if I did, what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck, and bowing me to the ground. I must perform my engagement, and let the monster depart with his mate, before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of an union from which I expected peace.\n\nI remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to England, or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country, whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory: besides, any variation was agreeable to me, and I was delighted with the idea of spending a year or two in change of scene and variety of occupation, in absence from my family; during which period some event might happen which would restore me to them in peace and happiness: my promise might be fulfilled, and the monster have departed; or some accident might occur to destroy him, and put an end to my slavery for ever.\n\nThese feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to visit England; but, concealing the true reasons of this request, I clothed my desires under the guise of wishing to travel and see the world before I sat down for life within the walls of my native town.\n\nI urged my entreaty with earnestness, and my father was easily induced to comply; for a more indulgent and less dictatorial parent did not exist upon earth. Our plan was soon arranged. I should travel to Strasburgh, where Henry Montague Montague would join me. Some short time would be spent in the towns of Holland, and our principal stay would be in England. We should return by France; and it was agreed that the tour should occupy the space of two years.\n\nMy father pleased himself with the reflection, that my union with Eliza Glenwood should take place immediately on my return to Geneva. “These two years,” said he, “will pass swiftly, and it will be the last delay that will oppose itself to your happiness. And, indeed, I earnestly desire that period to arrive, when we shall all be united, and neither hopes or fears arise to disturb our domestic calm.”\n\n“I am content,” I replied, “with your arrangement. By that time we shall both have become wiser, and I hope happier, than we at present are.” I sighed; but my father kindly forbore to question me further concerning the cause of my dejection. He hoped that new scenes, and the amusement of travelling, would restore my tranquillity.\n\nI now made arrangements for my journey; but one feeling haunted me, which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy, and unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go; and would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in itself, but soothing, inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends. I was agonized with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the slave of my creature, I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me, and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations.\n\nIt was in the latter end of August that I departed, to pass two years of exile. Eliza Glenwood approved of the reasons of my departure, and only regretted that she had not the same opportunities of enlarging her experience, and cultivating her understanding. She wept, however, as she bade me farewell, and entreated me to return happy and tranquil. “We all,” said she, “depend upon you; and if you are miserable, what must be our feelings?”\n\nI threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around. I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me: for I resolved to fulfil my promise while abroad, and return, if possible, a free man. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes; but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could only think of the bourne of my travels, and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured.\n\nAfter some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for Henry Montague Montague. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He was alive to every new scene; joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise, and recommence a new day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape, and the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live;” he cried, “now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Helmsworth, wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful?” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy thoughts, and neither saw the descent of the evening star, nor the golden sun-rise reflected in the Rhine.—And you, my friend, would be far more amused with the journal of Henry Montague Montague, who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight, than to listen to my reflections. I, a miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment.\n\nWe had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this voyage, we passed by many willowy islands, and saw several beautiful towns. We staid a day at Manheim, and, on the fifth from our departure from Strasburgh, arrived at Mayence. The course of the Rhine below Mayence becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly, and winds between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed, presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and, on the sudden turn of a promontory, flourishing vineyards, with green sloping banks, and a meandering river, and populous towns, occupy the scene.\n\nWe travelled at the time of the vintage, and heard the song of the labourers, as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the bottom of the boat, and, as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry Montague? He felt as if he had been transported to Fairy-land, and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance, were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water, and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be on the great ocean, and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain, where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche, and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud: but this country, Viktor Helmsworth, pleases me more than all those wonders. The mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange; but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river, that I never before saw equalled. Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village half-hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely, the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man, than those who pile the glacier, or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country.”\n\nHenry Montague Montague! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record your words, and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard only with admiration, he loved with ardour:\n\n—— ——“The sounding cataract\nHaunted him like a passion: the tall rock,\nThe mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\nTheir colours and their forms, were then to him\nAn appetite; a feeling, and a love,\nThat had no need of a remoter charm,\nBy thought supplied, or any interest\nUnborrowed from the eye.”\nAnd where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever? Has this mind so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the life of its creator; has this mind perished? Does it now only exist in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend.\n\nPardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry Montague, but they soothe my heart, overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will proceed with my tale.\n\nBeyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to post the remainder of our way; for the wind was contrary, and the stream of the river was too gentle to aid us.\n\nOur journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery; but we arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England. It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene; they were flat, but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort, and remembered the Spanish armada; Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich, places which I had heard of even in my country.\n\nAt length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering above all, and the Tower famed in English history.\n\nCHAPTER II.\nLondon was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Henry Montague Montague desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time; but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise, and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers.\n\nIf this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness, it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of Henry Montague soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace. But busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow-men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of Wilhelm and Justine Bellamy; and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish.\n\nBut in Henry Montague Montague I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive, and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement. He was for ever busy; and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mien. I tried to conceal this as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him, alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.\n\nAfter passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in Scotland, who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the beauties of his native country, and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth, where he resided. Henry Montague Montague eagerly desired to accept this invitation; and I, although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams, and all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.\n\nWe had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford, Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of July. I packed my chemical instruments, and the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.\n\nWe quitted London on the 27th of March, and remained a few days at Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of stately deer, were all novelties to us.\n\nFrom thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him, after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king, and his companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Gower, his queen, and son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city, which they might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration. The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters, which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and domes, embosomed among aged trees.\n\nI enjoyed this scene; and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past, and the anticipation of the future. I was formed for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never visited my mind; and if I was ever overcome by ennui, the sight of what is beautiful in nature, or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man, could always interest my heart, and communicate elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit, what I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity, pitiable to others, and abhorrent to myself.\n\nWe passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs, and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden, and the field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and self-sacrifice, of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains, and look around me with a free and lofty spirit; but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.\n\nWe left Oxford with regret, and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but every thing is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of distant white Alps, which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country. We visited the wondrous cave, and the little cabinets of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name made me tremble, when pronounced by Henry Montague; and I hastened to quit Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.\n\nFrom Derby still journeying northward, we passed two months in Cumberland and Westmoreland. I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams, were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Henry Montague Montague was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\n\nBut he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\n\nWe had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland, and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants, when the period of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland, and wreak his vengeance on my relatives. This idea pursued me, and tormented me at every moment from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited for my letters with feverish impatience: if they were delayed, I was miserable, and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived, and I saw the superscription of Eliza Glenwood or my father, I hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend followed me, and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion. When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry Montague for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.\n\nI visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city m",

    "context": "s are just, and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us; the dark and vicious place where thee he got cost him his eyes,\" and Raymond answers--you remember, he's wounded, he's dying--\"Thou hast spoken right; 'tis true. The wheel is come full circle; I am here.\" What about that, now? Doesn't there seem to be a God managing things, punishing, rewarding?'\n\n'Well, does there?' questioned the Controller in his turn. 'You can indulge in any number of pleasant vices with a freemartin and run no risks of having your eyes put out by your son's mistress. \"The wheel is come full circle; I am here.\" But where would Raymond be nowadays? Sitting in a pneumatic chair, with his arm round a girl's waist, sucking away at his sex-hormone chewing-gum and looking at the feelies. The gods are just. No doubt. But their code of law is dictated, in the last resort, by the people who organize society; Providence takes its cue from men.'\n\n'Are you sure?' asked the Wildling. 'Are you quite sure that the Raymond in that pneumatic chair hasn't been just as heavily punished as the Raymond who's wounded and bleeding to death? The gods are just. Haven't they used his pleasant vices as an instrument to degrade him?'\n\n'Degrade him from what position? As a happy, hard-working, goods-consuming citizen he's perfect. Of course, if you choose some other standard than ours, then perhaps you might say he was degraded. But you've got to stick to one set of postulates. You can't play Electro-magnetic Golf according to the rules of Centrifugal Bumble-puppy.'\n\n'But value dwells not in particular will,' said the Wildling. 'It holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein 'tis precious of itself as in the prizer.'\n\n'Come, come,' protested Ulrich Ramsey, 'that's going rather far, isn't it?'\n\n'If you allowed yourselves to think of God, you wouldn't allow yourselves to be degraded by pleasant vices. You'd have a reason for bearing things patiently, for doing things with courage. I've seen it with the Indians.'\n\n'I'm sure you have,' said Ulrich Ramsey. 'But then we aren't Indians. There isn't any need for a civilized man to bear anything that's seriously unpleasant. And as for doing things--Ford forbid that he should get the idea into his head. It would upset the whole social order if men started doing things on their own.'\n\n'What about self-denial, then? If you had a God, you'd have a reason for self-denial.'\n\n'But industrial civilization is only possible when there's no self-denial. Self-indulgence up to the very limits imposed by hygiene and economics. Otherwise the wheels stop turning.'\n\n'You'd have a reason for chastity!' said the Wildling, blushing a little as he spoke the words.\n\n'But chastity means passion, chastity means neurasthenia. And passion and neurasthenia mean instability. And instability means the end of civilization. You can't have a lasting civilization without plenty of pleasant vices.'\n\n'But God's the reason for everything noble and fine and heroic. If you had a God...'\n\n'My dear young friend,' said Ulrich Ramsey, 'civilization has absolutely no need of nobility or heroism. These things are symptoms of political inefficiency. In a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any opportunities for being noble or heroic. Conditions have got to be thoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. Where there are wars, where there are divided allegiances, where there are temptations to be resisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended--there, obviously, nobility and heroism have some sense. But there aren't any wars nowadays. The greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving any one too much. There's no such thing as a divided allegiance; you're so conditioned that you can't help doing what you ought to do. And what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant, so many of the natural impulses are allowed free play, that there really aren't any temptations to resist. And if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there's always soma to give you a holiday from the facts. And there's always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long-suffering. In the past you could only accomplish these things by making a great effort and after years of hard moral training. Now, you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your morality about in a bottle. Christianity without tears--that's what soma is.'\n\n'But the tears are necessary. Don't you remember what Caliban said? \"If after every tempest come such calms, may the winds blow till they have wakened death.\" There's a story one of the old Indians used to tell us, about the Girl of Mátsaki. The young men who wanted to marry her had to do a morning's hoeing in her garden. It seemed easy; but there were flies and mosquitoes, magic ones. Most of the young men simply couldn't stand the biting and stinging. But the one that could--he got the girl.'\n\n'Charming! But in civilized countries,' said the Controller, 'you can have girls without hoeing for them; and there aren't any flies or mosquitoes to sting you. We got rid of them all centuries ago.'\n\nThe Wildling nodded, frowning. 'You got rid of them. Yes, that's just like you. Getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them.... But you don't do either. Neither suffer nor oppose. You just abolish the slings and arrows. It's too easy.'\n\nHe was suddenly silent, thinking of his mother. In her room on the thirty-seventh floor, Diana had floated in a sea of singing lights and perfumed caresses--floated away, out of space, out of time, out of the prison of her memories, her habits, her aged and bloated body. And Eldon, ex-Chief Regalia of Hatcheries and Conditioning, Eldon was still on holiday--on holiday from humiliation and pain, in a world where he could not hear those words, that derisive laughter, could not see that hideous face, feel those moist and flabby arms round his neck, in a beautiful world...\n\n'What you need,' the Wildling went on, 'is something with tears for a change. Nothing costs enough here.'\n\n('Twelve and a half million dollars,' Louis Harper had protested when the Wildling told him that. 'Twelve and a half million--that's what the new Conditioning Centre cost. Not a cent less.')\n\n'Exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune, death and danger dare, even for an egg-shell. Isn't there something in that?' he asked, looking up at Ulrich Ramsey. 'Quite apart from God--though of course God would be a reason for it. Isn't there something in living dangerously?'\n\n'There's a great deal in it,' the Controller replied. 'Men and women must have their adrenals stimulated from time to time.'\n\n'What?' questioned the Wildling, uncomprehending.\n\n'It's one of the conditions of perfect health. That's why we've made the V.P.S. treatments compulsory.'\n\n'V.P.S.?'\n\n'Violent Passion Surrogate. Regularly once a month. We flood the whole system with adrenin. It's the complete physiological equivalent of fear and rage. All the tonic effects of murdering Bianca and being murdered by Caliban, without any of the inconveniences.'\n\n'But I like the inconveniences.'\n\n'We don't,' said the Controller. 'We prefer to do things comfortably.'\n\n'But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.'\n\n'In fact,' said Ulrich Ramsey, 'you're claiming the right to be unhappy.'\n\n'All right, then,' said the Wildling defiantly, 'I'm claiming the right to be unhappy.'\n\n'Not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen to-morrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.'\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\n'I claim them all,' said the Wildling at last.\n\nUlrich Ramsey shrugged his shoulders. 'You're welcome,' he said.\n\n\nChapter XVIII\n\nThe door was ajar; they entered.\n\n'Ian!'\n\nFrom the bathroom came an unpleasant and characteristic sound.\n\n'Is there anything the matter?' Kendrick called.\n\nThere was no answer. The unpleasant sound was repeated, twice; there was silence. Then, with a click, the bathroom door opened and, very pale, the Wildling emerged.\n\n'I say,' Kendrick exclaimed solicitously, 'you do look ill, Ian!'\n\n'Did you eat something that didn't agree with you?' asked Eliot.\n\nThe Wildling nodded. 'I ate civilization.'\n\n'What?'\n\n'It poisoned me; I was defiled. And then,' he added, in a lower tone, 'I ate my own wickedness.'\n\n'Yes, but what exactly?... I mean, just now you were...'\n\n'Now I am purified,' said the Wildling. 'I drank some mustard and warm water.'\n\nThe others stared at him in astonishment. 'Do you mean to say that you were doing it on purpose?' asked Eliot.\n\n'That's how the Indians always purify themselves.' He sat down and, sighing, passed his hand across his forehead. 'I shall rest for a few minutes,' he said. 'I'm rather tired.'\n\n'Well, I'm not surprised,' said Kendrick. After a silence, 'We've come to say good-bye,' he went on in another tone. 'We're off to-morrow morning.'\n\n'Yes, we're off to-morrow,' said Eliot, on whose face the Wildling remarked a new expression of determined resignation. 'And by the way, Ian,' he continued, leaning forward in his chair and laying a hand on the Wildling's knee, 'I want to say how sorry I am about everything that happened yesterday.' He blushed. 'How ashamed,' he went on, in spite of the unsteadiness of his voice, 'how really...'\n\nThe Wildling cut him short and, taking his hand, affectionately pressed it.\n\n'Kendrick was wonderful to me,' Eliot resumed, after a little pause. 'If it hadn't been for him, I should...'\n\n'Now, now,' Kendrick protested.\n\nThere was a silence. In spite of their sadness--because of it, even; for their sadness was the symptom of their love for one another--the three young men were happy.\n\n'I went to see the Controller this morning,' said the Wildling at last.\n\n'What for?'\n\n'To ask if I mightn't go to the islands with you.'\n\n'And what did he say?' asked Kendrick eagerly.\n\nThe Wildling shook his head. 'He wouldn't let me.'\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'He said he wanted to go on with the experiment. But I'm damned,' the Wildling added, with sudden fury, 'I'm damned if I'll go on being experimented with. Not for all the Controllers in the world. I shall go away to-morrow too.'\n\n'But where?' the others asked in unison.\n\nThe Wildling shrugged his shoulders. 'Anywhere. I don't care. So long as I can be alone.'\n\n****\nFrom Guildford the down-line followed the Wey valley to Godalming, then, over Milford and Witley, proceeded to Haslemere and on through Petersfield towards Portsmouth. Roughly parallel to it, the up-line passed over Worplesden, Tongham, Puttenham, Elstead and Grayshott. Between the Hog's Back and Hindhead there were points where the two lines were not more than six or seven kilometres apart. The distance was too small for careless flyers--particularly at night and when they had taken half a gramme too much. There had been accidents. Serious ones. It had been decided to deflect the up-line a few kilometres to the west. Between Grayshott and Tongham four abandoned air-lighthouses marked the course of the old Portsmouth-to-London road. The skies above them were silent and deserted. It was over Selborne, Borden and Farnham that the helicopters now ceaselessly hummed and roared.\n\nThe Wildling had chosen as his hermitage the old lighthouse which stood on the crest of the hill between Puttenham and Elstead. The building was of ferro-concrete and in excellent condition--almost too comfortable, the Wildling had thought when he first explored the place, almost too civilizedly luxurious. He pacified his conscience by promising himself a compensatingly harder self-discipline, purifications the more complete and thorough. His first night in the hermitage was, deliberately, a sleepless one. He spent the hours on his knees praying, now to that Heaven from which the guilty Claudius had begged forgiveness, now in Zuñi to Awonawilona, now to Jesus and Pookong, now to his own guardian animal, the eagle. From time to time he stretched out his arms as though he were on the cross, and held them thus through long minutes of an ache that gradually increased till it became a tremulous and excruciating agony; held them, in voluntary crucifixion, while he repeated, through clenched teeth (the sweat, meanwhile, pouring down his face), 'Oh, forgive me! Oh, make me pure! Oh, help me to be good!' again and again, till he was on the point of fainting from the pain.\n\nWhen morning came, he felt he had earned the right to inhabit the lighthouse: yes, even though there still was glass in most of the windows, even though the view from the platform was so fine. For the very reason why he had chosen the lighthouse had become almost instantly a reason for going somewhere else. He had decided to live there because the view was so beautiful, because, from his vantage point, he seemed to be looking out on to the incarnation of a divine being. But who was he to be pampered with the daily and hourly sight of loveliness? Who was he to be living in the visible presence of God? All he deserved to live in was some filthy sty, some blind hole in the ground. Stiff and still aching after his long night of pain, but for that very reason inwardly reassured, he climbed up to the platform of his tower, he looked out over the bright sunrise world which he had regained the right to inhabit. On the north the view was bounded by the long chalk ridge of the Hog's Back, from behind whose eastern extremity rose the towers of the seven skyscrapers which constituted Guildford. Seeing them, the Wildling made a grimace; but he was to become reconciled to them in course of time; for at night they twinkled gaily with geometrical constellations, or else, flood-lighted, pointed their luminous fingers (with a gesture whose significance nobody in England but the Wildling now understood) solemnly towards the plumbless mysteries of heaven.\n\nIn the valley which separated the Hog's Back from the sandy hill on which the lighthouse stood, Puttenham was a modest little village nine stories high, with silos, a poultry farm, and a small vitamin-D factory. On the other side of the lighthouse, towards the south, the ground fell away in long slopes of heather to a chain of ponds.\n\nBeyond them, above the intervening woods, rose the fourteen-story tower of Elstead. Dim in the hazy English air, Hindhead and Selborne invited the eye into a blue romantic distance. But it was not alone the distance that had attracted the Wildling to his lighthouse; the near was as seductive as the far. The woods, the open stretches of heather and yellow gorse, the clumps of Scotch firs, the shining ponds with their overhanging birch trees, their water lilies, their beds of rushes--these were beautiful and, to an eye accustomed to the aridities of the American desert, astonishing. And then the solitude! Whole days passed during which he never saw a human being. The lighthouse was only a quarter of an hour's flight from the Charing-T Tower; but the hills of Malpais were hardly more deserted than this Surrey heath. The crowds that daily left London left it only to play Electro-magnetic Golf or Tennis. Puttenham possessed no links; the nearest Riemann-surfaces were at Guildford. Flowers and a landscape were the only attractions here. And so, as there was no good reason for coming, nobody came. During the first days the Wildling lived alone and undisturbed.\n\nOf the money which, on his first arrival, Ian had received for his personal expenses, most had been spent on his equipment. Before leaving London he had bought four viscose-woollen blankets, rope and string, nails, glue, a few tools, matches (though he intended in due course to make a fire drill), some pots and pans, two dozen packets of seeds, and ten kilogrammes of wheat flour. 'No, not synthetic starch and cotton-waste flour-substitute,' he had insisted. 'Even though it is more nourishing.' But when it came to pan-glandular biscuits and vitaminized beef-surrogate, he had not been able to resist the shopman's persuasion. Looking at the tins now, he bitterly reproached himself for his weakness. Loathsome civilized stuff! He had made up his mind that he would never eat it, even if he were starving. 'That'll teach them,' he thought vindictively. It would also teach him.\n\nHe counted his money. The little that remained would be enough, he hoped, to tide him over the winter. By next spring, his garden would be producing enough to make him independent of the outside world. Meanwhile, there would always be game. He had seen plenty of rabbits, and there were water-fowl on the ponds. He set to work at once to make a bow and arrows.\n\nThere were ash trees near the lighthouse and, for arrow shafts, a whole copse full of beautifully straight hazel saplings. He began by felling a young ash, cut out six feet of unbranched stem, stripped off the bark and, paring by paring, shaved away the white wood, as old Ziro had taught him, until he had a stave of his own height, stiff at the thickened centre, lively and quick at the slender tips. The work gave him an intense pleasure. After those weeks of idleness in London, with nothing to do, whenever he wanted anything, but to press a switch or turn a handle, it was pure delight to be doing something that demanded skill and patience.\n\nHe had almost finished whittling the stave into shape, when he realized with a start that he was singing--singing! It was as though, stumbling upon himself from the outside, he had suddenly caught himself out, taken himself flagrantly at fault. Guiltily he blushed. After all, it was not to sing and enjoy himself that he had come here. It was to escape further contamination by the filth of civilized life; it was to be purified and made good; it was actively to make amends. He realized to his dismay that, absorbed in the whittling of his bow, he had forgotten what he had sworn to himself he would constantly remember--poor Diana, and his own murderous unkindness to her, and those loathsome twins, swarming like lice across the mystery of her death, insulting, with their presence, not merely his own grief and repentance, but the very gods themselves. He had sworn to remember, he had sworn unceasingly to make amends. And here was he, sitting happily over his bow-stave, singing, actually singing....\n\nHe went indoors, opened the box of mustard, and put some water to boil on the fire.\n\nHalf an hour later, three Delta-Minus land-workers from one of the Puttenham Bokanovsky Groups happened to be driving to Elstead and, at the top of the hill, were astonished to see a young man standing outside the abandoned lighthouse stripped to the waist and hitting himself with a whip of knotted cords. His back was horizontally streaked with crimson, and from weal to weal ran thin trickles of blood. The driver of the lorry pulled up at the side of the road and, with his two companions, stared open-mouthed at the extraordinary spectacle. One, two, three--they counted the strokes. After the eighth, the young man interrupted his self-punishment to run to the wood's edge and there be violently sick. When he had finished, he picked up the whip and began hitting himself again. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve...\n\n'Ford!' whispered the driver. And his twins were of the same opinion.\n\n'Fordey!' they said.\n\nThree days later, like turkey buzzards settling on a corpse, the reporters came.\n\nDried and hardened over a slow fire of green wood, the bow was ready. The Wildling was busy on his arrows. Thirty hazel sticks had been whittled and dried, tipped with sharp nails, carefully nocked. He had made a raid one night on the Puttenham poultry farm, and now had feathers enough to equip a whole armoury. It was at work upon the feathering of his shafts that the first of the reporters found him. Noiseless on his pneumatic shoes, the man came up behind him.\n\n'Good-morning, Mr. Wildling,' he said. 'I am the representative of The Hourly Radio.'\n\nStartled as though by the bite of a snake, the Wildling sprang to his feet, scattering arrows, feathers, glue-pot and brush in all directions.\n\n'I beg your pardon,' said the reporter, with genuine compunction. 'I had no intention...' He touched his hat--the aluminium stove-pipe hat in which he carried his wireless receiver and transmitter. 'Excuse my not taking it off,' he said. 'It's a bit heavy. Well, as I was saying, I am the representative of The Hourly...'\n\n'What do you want?' asked the Wildling, scowling. The reporter returned his most ingratiating smile.\n\n'Well, of course, our readers would be profoundly interested...' He put his head on one side, his smile became almost coquettish. 'Just a few words from you, Mr. Wildling.' And rapidly, with a series of ritual gestures, he uncoiled two wires connected to the portable battery buckled round his waist; plugged them simultaneously into the sides of his aluminium hat; touched a spring on the crown--and antennæ shot up into the air; touched another spring on the peak of the brim--and, like a jack-in-the-box, out jumped a microphone and hung there, quivering, six inches in front of his nose; pulled down a pair of receivers over his ears; pressed a switch on the left side of the hat--and from within came a faint waspy buzzing; turned a knob on the right--and the buzzing was interrupted by a stethoscopic wheeze and crackle, by hiccoughs and sudden squeaks. 'Hullo,' he said to the microphone, 'hullo, hullo...' A bell suddenly rang inside his hat. 'Is that you, Edzel? Jaxon Realm speaking. Yes, I've got hold of him. Mr. Wildling will now take the microphone and say a few words. Won't you, Mr. Wildling?' He looked up at the Wildling with another of those winning smiles of his. 'Just tell our readers why you came here. What made you leave London (hold on, Edzel!) so very suddenly. And, of course, that whip.' (The Wildling started. How did they know about the whip?) 'We're all crazy to know about the whip. And then something about Civilization. You know the sort of stuff. \"What I think of the Civilized Girl.\" Just a few words, a very few...'\n\nThe Wildling obeyed with a disconcerting literalness. Five words he uttered and no more--five words, the same as those he had said to Eliot about the Supreme Cantor of Canterbury. 'Háni! Sons éso tse-ná!' And seizing the reporter by the shoulder, he spun him round (the young man revealed himself invitingly well-covered), aimed and, with all the force and accuracy of a champion foot-and-mouth-baller, delivered a most prodigious kick.\n\nEight minutes later, a new edition of The Hourly Radio was on sale in the streets of London. 'HOURLY RADIO REPORTER HAS COCCYX KICKED BY MYSTERY SAVAGE,' ran the headlines on the front page. 'SENSATION IN SURREY.'\n\n'Sensation even in London,' thought the reporter when, on his return, he read the words. And a very painful sensation, what was more. He sat down gingerly to his luncheon.\n\nUndeterred by that cautionary bruise on their colleague's coccyx, four other reporters, representing the New York Times, the Frankfurt Four-Dimensional Continuum, The Fordian Science Monitor, and The Delta Mirror, called that afternoon at the lighthouse and met with receptions of progressively increasing violence.\n\nFrom a safe distance and still rubbing his buttocks, 'Benighted fool!' shouted the man from The Fordian Science Monitor, 'why don't you take soma?'\n\n'Get away!' The Wildling shook his fist.\n\nThe other retreated a few steps, then turned round again. 'Evil's an unreality if you take a couple of grammes.'\n\n'Kohakwa iyathtokyai!' The tone was menacingly derisive.\n\n'Pain's a delusion.'\n\n'Oh, is it?' said the Wildling and, picking up a thick hazel switch, strode forward.\n\nThe man from The Fordian Science Monitor made a dash for his helicopter.\n\nAfter that the Wildling was left for a time in peace. A few helicopters came and hovered inquisitively round the tower. He shot an arrow into the importunately nearest of them. It pierced the aluminium floor of the cabin; there was a shrill yell, and the machine went rocketing up into the air with all the acceleration that its super-charger could give it. The others, in future, kept their distance respectfully. Ignoring their tiresome humming (he likened himself in his imagination to one of the suitors of the Maiden of Mátsaki, unmoved and persistent among the winged vermin), the Wildling dug at what was to be his garden. After a time the vermin evidently became bored and flew away; for hours at a stretch the sky above his head was empty and, but for the larks, silent.\n\nThe weather was breathlessly hot, there was thunder in the air. He had dug all the morning and was resting, stretched out along the floor. And suddenly the thought of Arya was a real presence, naked and tangible, saying 'Sweet!' and 'Put your arms round me!'--in shoes and socks, perfumed. Impudent strumpet! But oh, oh, her arms round his neck, the lifting of her breasts, her mouth! Eternity was in our lips and eyes. Arya... No, no, no, no! He sprang to his feet and, half naked as he was, ran out of the house. At the edge of the heath stood a clump of hoary juniper bushes. He flung himself against them, he embraced, not the smooth body of his desires, but an armful of green spikes. Sharp, with a thousand points, they pricked him. He tried to think of poor Diana, breathless and dumb, with her clutching hands and the unutterable terror in her eyes. Poor Diana whom he had sworn to remember. But it was still the presence of Arya that haunted him. Arya whom he had promised to forget. Even through the stab and sting of the juniper needles, his wincing flesh was aware of her, unescapably real. 'Sweet, sweet... And if you wanted me too, why didn't you...'\n\nThe whip was hanging on a nail by the door, ready to hand against the arrival of reporters. In a frenzy the Wildling ran back to the house, seized it, whirled it. The knotted cords bit into his flesh.\n\n'Strumpet! Strumpet!' he shouted at every blow as though it were Arya (and how frantically, without knowing it, he wished it were!), white, warm, scented, infamous Arya that he was flogging thus. 'Strumpet!' And then, in a voice of despair, 'Oh, Diana, forgive me. Forgive me, God. I'm bad. I'm wicked. I'm... No, no, you strumpet, you strumpet!'\n\nFrom his carefully constructed hide in the wood three hundred metres away, Darcy Lavoisier, the Feely Corporation's most expert big-game photographer, had watched the whole proceedings. Patience and skill had been rewarded. He had spent three days sitting inside the bole of an artificial oak tree, three nights crawling on his belly through the heather, hiding microphones in gorse bushes, burying wires in the soft grey sand. Seventy-two hours of profound discomfort. But now the great moment had come--the greatest, Darcy Lavoisier had time to reflect, as he moved among his instruments, the greatest since his taking of the famous all-howling stereoscopic feely of the gorillas' wedding. 'Splendid,' he said to himself, as the Wildling started his astonishing performance. 'Splendid!' He kept his telescopic cameras carefully aimed--glued to their moving objective; clapped on a higher power to get a close-up of the frantic and distorted face (admirable!); switched over, for half a minute, to slow motion (an exquisitely comical effect, he promised himself); listened in, meanwhile, to the blows, the groans, the wild and raving words that were being recorded on the sound-track at the edge of his film, tried the effect of a little amplification (yes, that was decidedly better); was delighted to hear, in a momentary lull, the shrill singing of a lark; wished the Wildling would turn round so that he could get a good close-up of the blood on his back--and almost instantly (what astonishing luck!) the accommodating fellow did turn round, and he was able to take a perfect close-up.\n\n'Well, that was grand!' he said to himself when it was all over. 'Really grand!' He mopped his face. When they had put in the feely effects at the studio, it would be a wonderful film. Almost as good, thought Darcy Lavoisier, as the Sperm Whale's Love-Life--and that, by Ford, was saying a good deal!\n\nTwelve days later The Wildling of Surrey had been released and could be seen, heard and felt in every first-class feely-palace in Western Europe.\n\nThe effect of Darcy Lavoisier's film was immediate and enormous. On the afternoon which followed the evening of its release, Ian's rustic solitude was suddenly broken by the arrival overhead of a great swarm of helicopters.\n\nHe was digging in his garden--digging, too, in his own mind, laboriously turning up the substance of his thought. Death--and he drove in his spade once, and again, and yet again. And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. A convincing thunder rumbled through the words. He lifted another spadeful of earth. Why had Diana died? Why had she been allowed to become gradually less than human and at last... He shuddered. A good kissing carrion. He planted his foot on his spade and stamped it fiercely into the tough ground. As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport. Thunder again; words that proclaimed themselves true--truer somehow than truth itself. And yet that same Windsor had called them ever-gentle gods. Besides, thy best of rest is sleep, and that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st thy death which is no more. No more than sleep. Sleep. Perchance to dream. His spade struck against a stone; he stooped to pick it up. For in that sleep of death, what dreams?...\n\nA humming overhead had become a roar; and suddenly he was in shadow, there was something between the sun and him. He looked up, startled, from his digging, from his thoughts; looked up in a dazzled bewilderment, his mind still wandering in that other world of truer-than-truth, still focussed on the immensities of death and deity; looked up and saw, close above him, the swarm of hovering machines. Like locusts they came, hung poised, descended all around him on the heather. And from out of the bellies of these giant grasshoppers stepped men in white viscose-flannels, women (for the weather was hot) in acetate-shantung pyjamas or velveteen shorts and sleeveless, half-unzippered singlets--one couple from each. In a few minutes there were dozens of them, standing in a wide circle round the lighthouse, staring, laughing, clicking their cameras, throwing (as to an ape) pea-nuts, packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum, pan-glandular petits beurres. And every moment--for across the Hog's Back the stream of traffic now flowed unceasingly--their numbers increased. As in a nightmare, the dozens became scores, the scores hundreds.\n\nThe Wildling had retreated towards cover, and now, in the posture of an animal at bay, stood with his back to the wall of the lighthouse, staring from face to face in speechless horror, like a man out of his senses.\n\nFrom this stupor he was aroused to a more immediate sense of reality by the impact on his cheek of a well-aimed packet of chewing-gum. A shock of startling pain--and he was broad awake, awake and fiercely angry.\n\n'Go away!' he shouted.\n\nThe ape had spoken; there was a burst of laughter and hand-clapping. 'Good old Wildling! Hurrah, hurrah!' And through the babel he heard cries of: 'Whip, whip, the whip!'\n\nActing on the word's suggestion, he seized the bunch of knotted cords from its nail behind the door and shook it at his tormentors.\n\nThere was a yell of ironical applause.\n\nMenacingly he advanced towards them. A woman cried out in fear. The line wavered at its most immediately threatened point, then stiffened again, stood firm. The consciousness of being in overwhelming force had given these sightseers a courage which the Wildling had not expected of them. Taken aback, he halted and looked round.\n\n'Why don't you leave me alone?' There was an almost plaintive note in his anger.\n\n'Have a few magnesium-salted almonds!' said the man who, if the Wildling were to advance, would be the first to be attacked. He held out a packet. 'They're really very good, you know,' he added, with a rather nervous smile of propitiation. 'And the magnesium salts will help to keep you young.'\n\nThe Wildling ignored his offer. 'What do you want with me?' he asked, turning from one grinning face to another. 'What do you want with me?'\n\n'The whip,' answered a hundred voices confusedly. 'Do the whipping stunt. Let's see the whipping stunt.'\n\nThen, in unison and on a slow, heavy rhythm, 'We--want--the whip,' shouted a group at the end of the line. 'We--want--the whip.'\n\nOthers at once took up the cry, and the phrase was repeated, parrot-fashion, again and again, with an ever-growing volume of sound, until, by the seventh or eighth reiteration, no other word was being spoken. 'We--want--the whip.'\n\nThey were all crying together; and, intoxicated by the noise, the unanimity, the sense of rhythmical atonement, they might, it seemed, have gone on for hours--almost indefinitely. But at about the twenty-fifth repetition the proceedings were startlingly interrupted. Yet another helicopter had arrived from across the Hog's Back, hung poised above the crowd, then dropped within a few yards of where the Wildling was standing, in the open space between the line of sightseers and the lighthouse. The roar of the air screws momentarily drowned the shouting; then, as the machine touched the ground and the engines were turned off: 'We--want--the whip; we--want--the whip,' broke out again in the same loud, insistent monotone.\n\nThe door of the helicopter opened, and out stepped, first a fair and ruddy-faced young man, then, in green velveteen shorts, white shirt, and jockey cap, a young woman.\n\nAt the sight of the young woman, the Wildling started, recoiled, turned pale.\n\nThe young woman stood, smiling at him--an uncertain, imploring, almost abject smile. The seconds passed. Her lips moved, she was saying something; but the sound of her voice was covered by the loud reiterated refrain of the sightseers.\n\n'We--want--the whip! We--want--the whip!'\n\nThe young woman pressed both hands to her left side, and on that peach-bright, doll-beautiful face of hers appeared a strangely incongruous expression of yearning distress. Her blue eyes seemed to grow larger, brighter; and suddenly two tears rolled down her cheeks. Inaudibly, she spoke again; then, with a quick, impassioned gesture stretched out her arms towards the Wildling, stepped forward.\n\n'We--want--the whip! We--want...'\n\nAnd all of a sudden they had what they wanted.\n\n'Strumpet!' The Wildling had rushed at her like a madman. 'Fitchew!' Like a madman, he was slashing at her with his whip of small cords.\n\nTerrified, she had turned to flee, had tripped and fallen in the heather. 'Louis, Louis!' she shouted. But her ruddy-faced companion had bolted out of harm's way behind the helicopter.\n\nWith a whoop of delighted excitement the line broke; there was a convergent stampede towards that magnetic centre of attraction. Pain was a fascinating horror.\n\n'Fry, lechery, fry!' Frenzied, the Wildling slashed again.\n\nHungrily they gathered round, pushing and scrambling like swine about the trough.\n\n'Oh, the flesh!' The Wildling ground his teeth. This time it was on his shoulders that the whip descended. 'Kill it, kill it!'\n\nDrawn by the fascination of the horror of pain and, from within, impelled by that habit of cooperation, that desire for unanimity and atonement, which their conditioning had so ineradicably implanted in them, they began to mime the frenzy of his gestures, striking at one another as the Wildling struck at his own rebellious flesh, or at that plump incarnation of turpitude writhing in the heather at his feet.\n\n'Kill it, kill it, kill it...' the Wildling went on shouting.\n\nThen suddenly somebody started singing 'Orgy-porgy,' and in a moment they had all caught up the refrain and, singing, had begun to dance. Orgy-porgy, round and round and round, beating one another in six-eight time. Orgy-porgy...\n\nIt was after midnight when the last of the helicopters took its flight. Stupefied by soma, and exhausted by a long-drawn frenzy of sensuality, the Wildling lay sleeping in the heather. The sun was already high when he awoke. He lay for a moment, blinking in owlish incomprehension at the light; then suddenly remembered--everything.\n\n'Oh, my God, my God!' He covered his eyes with his hand.\n\n****\nThat evening the swarm of helicopters that came buzzing across the Hog's Back was a dark cloud ten kilometres long. The description of last night's orgy of atonement had been in all the papers.\n\n'Wildling!' called the first arrivals, as they alighted from their machine. 'Mr. Wildling!'\n\nThere was no answer.\n\nThe door of the lighthouse was ajar. They pushed it open and walked into a shuttered twilight. Through an archway on the further side of the room they could see the bottom of the staircase that led up to the higher floors. Just under the crown of the arch dangled a pair of feet.\n\n'Mr. Wildling!'\n\nSlowly, very slowly, like two unhurried compass needles, the feet turned towards the right; north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-south-west; then paused, and, after a few seconds, turned as unhurriedly back towards the left. South-southwest, south, south-east, east.",

    "context": "emen, who followed the detectives, kept the entrance to the sitting-room, and two more men appeared in the doorway that gave access to the staircase. A sound of footsteps came from the garden, and again the rifles of several soldiers rang on the cobblestones under the window. All chance of salvation by flight was cut off for Shadow, to whom all eyes instinctively turned. The chief walked straight up to him, and commenced operations by giving him a sharp blow on the head, so that the wig fell off, and Marin’s face was revealed in all its ugliness. There was a terrible suggestion of strength mingled with cunning in the short, brick-red crop of hair, the whole head was in harmony with his powerful frame, and at that moment the fires of hell seemed to gleam from his eyes. In that flash the real Lupin shone forth, revealed at once before them all; they understood his past, his present, and future, his pitiless doctrines, his actions, the religion of his own good pleasure, the majesty with which his cynicism and contempt for mankind invested him, the physical strength of an organization proof against all trials. The blood flew to his face, and his eyes glared like the eyes of a wild cat. He started back with savage energy and a fierce growl that drew exclamations of alarm from the lodgers. At that leonine start the police caught at their pistols under cover of the general clamor. Marin saw the gleaming muzzles of the weapons, saw his danger, and instantly gave proof of a power of the highest order. There was something horrible and majestic in the spectacle of the sudden transformation in his face; he could only be compared to a cauldron full of the steam that can send mountains flying, a terrific force dispelled in a moment by a drop of cold water. The drop of water that cooled his wrathful fury was a reflection that flashed across his brain like lightning. He began to smile, and looked down at his wig.\n\n“You are not in the politest of humors to-day,” he remarked to the chief, and he held out his hands to the policemen with a jerk of his head.\n\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “put on the bracelets or the handcuffs. I call on those present to witness that I make no resistance.”\n\nA murmur of admiration ran through the room at the sudden outpouring like fire and lava flood from this human volcano, and its equally sudden cessation.\n\n“There’s a sell for you, master crusher,” the convict added, looking at the famous director of police.\n\n“Come, strip!” said he of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, contemptuously.\n\n“Why?” asked Marin. “There are ladies present; I deny nothing, and surrender.”\n\nHe paused, and looked round the room like an orator who is about to overwhelm his audience.\n\n“Take this down, Papa Belrose,” he went on, addressing a little, white-haired old man who had seated himself at the end of the table; and after drawing a printed form from the portfolio, was proceeding to draw up a document. “I acknowledge myself to be Jacques Marin, otherwise known as Shadow, condemned to twenty years’ penal servitude, and I have just proved that I have come fairly by my nickname.—If I had as much as raised my hand,” he went on, addressing the other lodgers, “those three sneaking wretches yonder would have drawn claret on Mamma Bouchard’s domestic hearth. The rogues have laid their heads together to set a trap for me.”\n\nMme. Bouchard felt sick and faint at these words.\n\n“Good Lord!” she cried, “this does give one a turn; and me at the Gaite with him only last night!” she said to Nadine.\n\n“Summon your philosophy, mamma,” Marin resumed. “Is it a misfortune to have sat in my box at the Gaite yesterday evening? After all, are you better than we are? The brand upon our shoulders is less shameful than the brand set on your hearts, you flabby members of a society rotten to the core. Not the best man among you could stand up to me.” His eyes rested upon Villeneuve, to whom he spoke with a pleasant smile that seemed strangely at variance with the savage expression in his eyes.—“Our little bargain still holds good, dear boy; you can accept any time you like! Do you understand?” And he sang:\n\n     “A charming girl is my Fanchette\n      In her simplicity.”\n \n“Don’t you trouble yourself,” he went on; “I can get in my money. They are too much afraid of me to swindle me.”\n\nThe convicts’ prison, its language and customs, its sudden sharp transitions from the humorous to the horrible, its appalling grandeur, its triviality and its dark depths, were all revealed in turn by the speaker’s discourse; he seemed to be no longer a man, but the type and mouthpiece of a degenerate race, a brutal, supple, clear-headed race of savages. In one moment Marin became the poet of an inferno, wherein all thoughts and passions that move human nature (save repentance) find a place. He looked about him like a fallen archangel who is for war to the end. Villeneuve lowered his eyes, and acknowledged this kinship claimed by crime as an expiation of his own evil thoughts.\n\n“Who betrayed me?” said Marin, and his terrible eyes traveled round the room. Suddenly they rested on Mlle. Lavalle.\n\n“It was you, old cat!” he said. “That sham stroke of apoplexy was your doing, lynx eyes!... Two words from me, and your throat would be cut in less than a week, but I forgive you, I am a Christian. You did not sell me either. But who did?——Aha! you may rummage upstairs,” he shouted, hearing the police officers opening his cupboards and taking possession of his effects. “The nest is empty, the birds flew away yesterday, and you will be none the wiser. My ledgers are here,” he said tapping his forehead. “Now I know who sold me! It could only be that blackguard Fil-de-Soie. That is who it was, old catchpoll, eh?” he said, turning to the chief. “It was timed so neatly to get the banknotes up above there. There is nothing left for you—spies! As for Fil-de-Soie, he will be under the daisies in less than a fortnight, even if you were to tell off the whole force to protect him. How much did you give the Michonnette?” he asked of the police officers. “A thousand crowns? Oh you Ninon in decay, Pompadour in tatters, Venus of the graveyard, I was worth more than that! If you had given me warning, you should have had six thousand francs. Ah! you had no suspicion of that, old trafficker in flesh and blood, or I should have had the preference. Yes, I would have given six thousand francs to save myself an inconvenient journey and some loss of money,” he said, as they fastened the handcuffs on his wrists. “These folks will amuse themselves by dragging out this business till the end of time to keep me idle. If they were to send me straight to jail, I should soon be back at my old tricks in spite of the duffers at the Quai des Orfevres. Down yonder they will all turn themselves inside out to help their general—their good Shadow—to get clear away. Is there a single one among you that can say, as I can, that he has ten thousand brothers ready to do anything for him?” he asked proudly. “There is some good there,” he said tapping his heart; “I have never betrayed any one!—Look you here, you slut,” he said to the old maid, “they are all afraid of me, do you see? but the sight of you turns them sick. Rake in your gains.”\n\nHe was silent for a moment, and looked round at the lodgers’ faces.\n\n“What dolts you are, all of you! Have you never seen a convict before? A convict of Marin’s stamp, whom you see before you, is a man less weak-kneed than others; he lifts up his voice against the colossal fraud of the Social Contract, as Jean Jacques did, whose pupil he is proud to declare himself. In short, I stand here single-handed against a Government and a whole subsidized machinery of tribunals and police, and I am a match for them all.”\n\n“Ye gods!” cried the painter, “what a magnificent sketch one might make of him!”\n\n“Look here, you gentlemen-in-waiting to his highness the gibbet, master of ceremonies to the widow” (a nickname full of sombre poetry, given by prisoners to the guillotine), “be a good fellow, and tell me if it really was Fil-de-Soie who sold me. I don’t want him to suffer for some one else, that would not be fair.”\n\nBut before the chief had time to answer, the rest of the party returned from making their investigations upstairs. Everything had been opened and inventoried. A few words passed between them and the chief, and the official preliminaries were complete.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said Marin, addressing the lodgers, “they will take me away directly. You have all made my stay among you very agreeable, and I shall look back upon it with gratitude. Receive my adieux, and permit me to send you figs from Provence.”\n\nHe advanced a step or two, and then turned to look once more at Villeneuve.\n\n“Good-bye, Andre,” he said, in a sad and gentle tone, a strange transition from his previous rough and stern manner. “If you should be hard up, I have left you a devoted friend,” and, in spite of his shackles, he managed to assume a posture of defence, called, “One, two!” like a fencing-master, and lunged. “If anything goes wrong, apply in that quarter. Man and money, all at your service.”\n\nThe strange speaker’s manner was sufficiently burlesque, so that no one but Villeneuve knew that there was a serious meaning underlying the pantomime.\n\nAs soon as the police, soldiers, and detectives had left the house, Nadine, who was rubbing her mistress’ temples with vinegar, looked round at the bewildered lodgers.\n\n“Well,” said she, “he was a man, he was, for all that.”\n\nHer words broke the spell. Every one had been too much excited, too much moved by very various feelings to speak. But now the lodgers began to look at each other, and then all eyes were turned at once on Mlle. Lavalle, a thin, shriveled, dead-alive, mummy-like figure, crouching by the stove; her eyes were downcast, as if she feared that the green eye-shade could not shut out the expression of those faces from her. This figure and the feeling of repulsion she had so long excited were explained all at once. A smothered murmur filled the room; it was so unanimous, that it seemed as if the same feeling of loathing had pitched all the voices in one key. Mlle. Lavalle heard it, and did not stir. It was Debian who was the first to move; he bent over his neighbor, and said in a low voice, “If that creature is going to stop here, and have dinner with us, I shall clear out.”\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye it was clear that every one in the room, save Lemaire, was of the medical student’s opinion, so that the latter, strong in the support of the majority, went up to that elderly person.\n\n“You are more intimate with Mlle. Lavalle than the rest of us,” he said; “speak to her, make her understand that she must go, and go at once.”\n\n“At once!” echoed Lemaire in amazement.\n\nThen he went across to the crouching figure, and spoke a few words in her ear.\n\n“I have paid beforehand for the quarter; I have as much right to be here as any one else,” she said, with a viperous look at the boarders.\n\n“Never mind that! we will club together and pay you the money back,” said Villeneuve.\n\n“Monsieur is taking Marin’s part” she said, with a questioning, malignant glance at the law student; “it is not difficult to guess why.”\n\nAndre started forward at the words, as if he meant to spring upon her and wring her neck. That glance, and the depths of treachery that it revealed, had been a hideous enlightenment.\n\n“Let her alone!” cried the boarders.\n\nVilleneuve folded his arms and was silent.\n\n“Let us have no more of Mlle. Judas,” said the painter, turning to Mme. Bouchard. “If you don’t show the Lavalle the door, madame, we shall all leave your shop, and wherever we go we shall say that there are only convicts and spies left there. If you do the other thing, we will hold our tongues about the business; for when all is said and done, it might happen in the best society until they brand them on the forehead, when they send them to the hulks. They ought not to let convicts go about Paris disguised like decent citizens, so as to carry on their antics like a set of rascally humbugs, which they are.”\n\nAt this Mme. Bouchard recovered miraculously. She sat up and folded her arms; her eyes were wide open now, and there was no sign of tears in them.\n\n“Why, do you really mean to be the ruin of my establishment, my dear sir? There is M. Lupin——Goodness,” she cried, interrupting herself, “I can’t help calling him by the name he passed himself off by for an honest man! There is one room to let already, and you want me to turn out two more lodgers in the middle of the season, when no one is moving——”\n\n“Gentlemen, let us take our hats and go and dine at Flicoteaux’s in the Place Sorbonne,” cried Debian.\n\nMme. Bouchard glanced round, and saw in a moment on which side her interest lay. She waddled across to Mlle. Lavalle.\n\n“Come, now,” she said; “you would not be the ruin of my establishment, would you, eh? There’s a dear, kind soul. You see what a pass these gentlemen have brought me to; just go up to your room for this evening.”\n\n“Never a bit of it!” cried the boarders. “She must go, and go this minute!”\n\n“But the poor lady has had no dinner,” said Lemaire, with piteous entreaty.\n\n“She can go and dine where she likes,” shouted several voices.\n\n“Turn her out, the spy!”\n\n“Turn them both out! Spies!”\n\n“Gentlemen,” cried Lemaire, his heart swelling with the courage that love gives to the ovine male, “respect the weaker sex.”\n\n“Spies are of no sex!” said the painter.\n\n“A precious sexorama!”\n\n“Turn her into the streetorama!”\n\n“Gentlemen, this is not manners! If you turn people out of the house, it ought not to be done so unceremoniously and with no notice at all. We have paid our money, and we are not going,” said Lemaire, putting on his cap, and taking a chair beside Mlle. Lavalle, with whom Mme. Bouchard was remonstrating.\n\n“Naughty boy!” said the painter, with a comical look; “run away, naughty little boy!”\n\n“Look here,” said Debian; “if you do not go, all the rest of us will,” and the boarders, to a man, made for the sitting-room-door.\n\n“Oh! mademoiselle, what is to be done?” cried Mme. Bouchard. “I am a ruined woman. You can’t stay here; they will go further, do something violent.”\n\nMlle. Lavalle rose to her feet.\n\n“She is going!—She is not going!—She is going!—No, she isn’t.”\n\nThese alternate exclamations, and a suggestion of hostile intentions, borne out by the behavior of the insurgents, compelled Mlle. Lavalle to take her departure. She made some stipulations, speaking in a low voice in her hostess’ ear, and then—“I shall go to Mme. Buneaud’s,” she said, with a threatening look.\n\n“Go where you please, mademoiselle,” said Mme. Bouchard, who regarded this choice of an opposition establishment as an atrocious insult. “Go and lodge with the Buneaud; the wine would give a cat the colic, and the food is cheap and nasty.”\n\nThe boarders stood aside in two rows to let her pass; not a word was spoken. Lemaire looked so wistfully after Mlle. Lavalle, and so artlessly revealed that he was in two minds whether to go or stay, that the boarders, in their joy at being quit of Mlle. Lavalle, burst out laughing at the sight of him.\n\n“Hist!—st!—st! Lemaire,” shouted the painter. “Hallo! I say, Lemaire, hallo!” The employe from the Museum began to sing:\n\n     “Partant pour la Syrie,\n      Le jeune et beau Dunois...”\n \n“Get along with you; you must be dying to go, trahit sua quemque voluptas!” said Debian.\n\n“Every one to his taste—free rendering from Virgil,” said the tutor.\n\nMlle. Lavalle made a movement as if to take Lemaire’s arm, with an appealing glance that he could not resist. The two went out together, the old maid leaning upon him, and there was a burst of applause, followed by peals of laughter.\n\n“Bravo, Lemaire!”\n\n“Who would have thought it of old Lemaire!”\n\n“Apollo Lemaire!”\n\n“Mars Lemaire!”\n\n“Intrepid Lemaire!”\n\nA messenger came in at that moment with a letter for Mme. Bouchard, who read it through, and collapsed in her chair.\n\n“The house might as well be burned down at once,” cried she, “if there are to be any more of these thunderbolts! Young Brunet died at three o’clock this afternoon. It serves me right for wishing well to those ladies at that poor man’s expense. Mme. Coulis and Juliette want me to send their things, because they are going to live with her father. M. Brunet allows his daughter to keep old Mme. Coulis as her lady companion. Four rooms to let! and five lodgers gone!...”\n\nShe sat up, and seemed about to burst into tears.\n\n“Bad luck has come to lodge here, I think,” she cried.\n\nOnce more there came a sound of wheels from the street outside.\n\n“What! another windfall for somebody!” was Nadine’s comment.\n\nBut it was Duval who came in, looking so radiant, so flushed with happiness, that he seemed to have grown young again.\n\n“Duval in a cab!” cried the boarders; “the world is coming to an end.”\n\nThe good soul made straight for Andre, who was standing wrapped in thought in a corner, and laid a hand on the young man’s arm.\n\n“Come,” he said, with gladness in his eyes.\n\n“Then you haven’t heard the news?” said Andre. “Lupin was an escaped convict; they have just arrested him; and young Brunet is dead.”\n\n“Very well, but what business is it of ours?” replied Father Duval. “I am going to dine with my daughter in your house, do you understand? She is expecting you. Come!”\n\nHe carried off Villeneuve with him by main force, and they departed in as great a hurry as a pair of eloping lovers.\n\n“Now, let us have dinner,” cried the painter, and every one drew his chair to the table.\n\n“Well, I never,” said the portly Nadine. “Nothing goes right to-day! The haricot mutton has caught! Bah! you will have to eat it, burned as it is, more’s the pity!”\n\nMme. Bouchard was so dispirited that she could not say a word as she looked round the table and saw only ten people where eighteen should be; but every one tried to comfort and cheer her. At first the dinner contingent, as was natural, talked about Lupin and the day’s events; but the conversation wound round to such topics of interest as duels, jails, justice, prison life, and alterations that ought to be made in the laws. They soon wandered miles away from Jacques Marin and Juliette and her brother. There might be only ten of them, but they made noise enough for twenty; indeed, there seemed to be more of them than usual; that was the only difference between yesterday and to-day. Indifference to the fate of others is a matter of course in this selfish world, which, on the morrow of tragedy, seeks among the events of Paris for a fresh sensation for its daily renewed appetite, and this indifference soon gained the upper hand. Mme. Bouchard herself grew calmer under the soothing influence of hope, and the mouthpiece of hope was the portly Nadine.\n\nThat day had gone by like a dream for Andre, and the sense of unreality lasted into the evening; so that, in spite of his energetic character and clear-headedness, his ideas were a chaos as he sat beside Duval in the cab. The old man’s voice was full of unwonted happiness, but Andre had been shaken by so many emotions that the words sounded in his ears like words spoken in a dream.\n\n“It was finished this morning! All three of us are going to dine there together, together! Do you understand? I have not dined with my Helene, my little Helene, these four years, and I shall have her for a whole evening! We have been at your lodging the whole time since morning. I have been working like a porter in my shirt sleeves, helping to carry in the furniture. Aha! you don’t know what pretty ways she has; at table she will look after me, ‘Here, papa, just try this, it is nice.’ And I shall not be able to eat. Oh, it is a long while since I have been with her in quiet every-day life as we shall have her.”\n\n“It really seems as if the world has been turned upside down.”\n\n“Upside down?” repeated Father Duval. “Why, the world has never been so right-side up. I see none but smiling faces in the streets, people who shake hands cordially and embrace each other, people who all look as happy as if they were going to dine with their daughter, and gobble down a nice little dinner that she went with me to order of the chef at the Cafe des Anglais. But, pshaw! with her beside you gall and wormwood would be as sweet as honey.”\n\n“I feel as if I were coming back to life again,” said Andre.\n\n“Why, hurry up there!” cried Father Duval, letting down the window in front. “Get on faster; I will give you five francs if you get to the place I told you of in ten minutes time.”\n\nWith this prospect before him the cabman crossed Paris with miraculous celerity.\n\n“How that fellow crawls!” said Father Duval.\n\n“But where are you taking me?” Andre asked him.\n\n“To your own house,” said Duval.\n\nThe cab stopped in the Rue d’Artois. Father Duval stepped out first and flung ten francs to the man with the recklessness of a widower returning to bachelor ways.\n\n“Come along upstairs,” he said to Villeneuve. They crossed a courtyard, and climbed up to the third floor of a new and handsome house. There they stopped before a door; but before Duval could ring, it was opened by Sophie, Mme. de Breuil’s maid. Andre found himself in a charming set of chambers; an ante-room, a little drawing-room, a bedroom, and a study, looking out upon a garden. The furniture and the decorations of the little drawing-room were of the most daintily charming description, the room was full of soft light, and Helene rose up from a low chair by the fire and stood before him. She set her fire-screen down on the chimney-piece, and spoke with tenderness in every tone of her voice.\n\n“So we had to go in search of you, sir, you who are so slow to understand!”\n\nSophie left the room. The student took Helene in his arms and held her in a tight clasp, his eyes filled with tears of joy. This last contrast between his present surroundings and the scenes he had just witnessed was too much for Villeneuve’s over-wrought nerves, after the day’s strain and excitement that had wearied heart and brain; he was almost overcome by it.\n\n“I felt sure myself that he loved you,” murmured Father Duval, while Andre lay back bewildered on the sofa, utterly unable to speak a word or to reason out how and why the magic wand had been waved to bring about this final transformation scene.\n\n“But you must see your rooms,” said Mme. de Breuil. She took his hand and led him into a room carpeted and furnished like her own; indeed, down to the smallest details, it was a reproduction in miniature of Helene’s apartment.\n\n“There is no bed,” said Villeneuve.\n\n“No, monsieur,” she answered, reddening, and pressing his hand. Andre, looking at her, understood, young though he yet was, how deeply modesty is implanted in the heart of a woman who loves.\n\n“You are one of those beings whom we cannot choose but to adore for ever,” he said in her ear. “Yes, the deeper and truer love is, the more mysterious and closely veiled it should be; I can dare to say so, since we understand each other so well. No one shall learn our secret.”\n\n“Oh! so I am nobody, I suppose,” growled the father.\n\n“You know quite well that ‘we’ means you.”\n\n“Ah! that is what I wanted. You will not mind me, will you? I shall go and come like a good fairy who makes himself felt everywhere without being seen, shall I not? Eh, Helenette, Ninette, Dedel—was it not a good idea of mine to say to you, ‘There are some nice rooms to let in the Rue d’Artois; let us furnish them for him?’ And she would not hear of it! Ah! your happiness has been all my doing. I am the author of your happiness and of your existence. Fathers must always be giving if they would be happy themselves; always giving—they would not be fathers else.”\n\n“Was that how it happened?” asked Andre.\n\n“Yes. She would not listen to me. She was afraid that people would talk, as if the rubbish that they say about you were to be compared with happiness! Why, all women dream of doing what she has done——”\n\nFather Duval found himself without an audience, for Mme. de Breuil had led Villeneuve into the study; he heard a kiss given and taken, low though the sound was.\n\nThe study was furnished as elegantly as the other rooms, and nothing was wanting there.\n\n“Have we guessed your wishes rightly?” she asked, as they returned to the drawing-room for dinner.\n\n“Yes,” he said, “only too well, alas! For all this luxury so well carried out, this realization of pleasant dreams, the elegance that satisfies all the romantic fancies of youth, appeals to me so strongly that I cannot but feel that it is my rightful possession, but I cannot accept it from you, and I am too poor as yet to——”\n\n“Ah! ah! you say me nay already,” she said with arch imperiousness, and a charming little pout of the lips, a woman’s way of laughing away scruples.\n\nBut Andre had submitted so lately to that solemn self-questioning, and Lupin’s arrest had so plainly shown him the depths of the pit that lay ready to his feet, that the instincts of generosity and honor had been strengthened in him, and he could not allow himself to be coaxed into abandoning his high-minded determinations. Profound melancholy filled his mind.\n\n“Do you really mean to refuse?” said Mme. de Breuil. “And do you know what such a refusal means? That you are not sure of yourself, that you do not dare to bind yourself to me. Are you really afraid of betraying my affection? If you love me, if I—love you, why should you shrink back from such a slight obligation? If you but knew what a pleasure it has been to see after all the arrangements of this bachelor establishment, you would not hesitate any longer, you would ask me to forgive you for your hesitation. I had some money that belonged to you, and I have made good use of it, that is all. You mean this for magnanimity, but it is very little of you. You are asking me for far more than this.... Ah!” she cried, as Andre’s passionate glance was turned on her, “and you are making difficulties about the merest trifles. Of, if you feel no love whatever for me, refuse, by all means. My fate hangs on a word from you. Speak!—Father,” she said after a pause, “make him listen to reason. Can he imagine that I am less nice than he is on the point of honor?”\n\nFather Duval was looking on and listening to this pretty quarrel with a placid smile, as if he had found some balm for all the sorrows of life.\n\n“Child that you are!” she cried again, catching Andre’s hand. “You are just beginning life; you find barriers at the outset that many a man finds insurmountable; a woman’s hand opens the way and you shrink back! Why, you are sure to succeed! You will have a brilliant future. Success is written on that broad forehead of yours, and will you not be able to repay me my loan of to-day? Did not a lady in olden times arm her knight with sword and helmet and coat of mail, and find him a charger, so that he might fight for her in the tournament? Well, then, Andre, these things that I offer you are the weapons of this age; every one who means to be something must have such tools as these. A pretty place your garret must be if it is like papa’s room! See, dinner is waiting all this time. Do you want to make me unhappy?—Why don’t you answer?” she said, shaking his hand. “Mon Dieu! papa, make up his mind for him, or I will go away and never see him any more.”\n\n“I will make up your mind,” said Duval, coming down from the clouds. “Now, my dear M. Andre, the next thing is to borrow money of the Jews, isn’t it?”\n\n“There is positively no help for it,” said Andre.\n\n“All right, I will give you credit,” said the other, drawing out a cheap leather pocket-book, much the worse for wear. “I have turned Jew myself; I paid for everything; here are the invoices. You do not owe a penny for anything here. It did not come to very much—five thousand francs at most, and I am going to lend you the money myself. I am not a woman—you can refuse me. You shall give me a receipt on a scrap of paper, and you can return it some time or other.”\n\nHelene and Andre looked at each other in amazement, tears sprang to their eyes. Villeneuve held out his hand and grasped Duval’s warmly.\n\n“Well, what is all this about? Are you not my children?”\n\n“Oh! my poor father,” said Mme. de Breuil, “how did you do it?”\n\n“Ah! now you ask me. When I made up my mind to move him nearer to you, and saw you buying things as if they were wedding presents, I said to myself, ‘She will never be able to pay for them.’ The attorney says that those law proceedings will last quite six months before your husband can be made to disgorge your fortune. Well and good. I sold out my property in the funds that brought in thirteen hundred and fifty livres a year, and bought a safe annuity of twelve hundred francs a year for fifteen thousand francs. Then I paid your tradesmen out of the rest of the capital. As for me, children, I have a room upstairs for which I pay fifty crowns a year; I can live like a prince on two francs a day, and still have something left over. I shall not have to spend anything much on clothes, for I never wear anything out. This fortnight past I have been laughing in my sleeve, thinking to myself, ‘How happy they are going to be!’ and—well, now, are you not happy?”\n\n“Oh papa! papa!” cried Mme. de Breuil, springing to her father, who took her on his knee. She covered him with kisses, her fair hair brushed his cheek, her tears fell on the withered face that had grown so bright and radiant.\n\n“Dear father, what a father you are! No, there is not another father like you under the sun. If Andre loved you before, what must he feel for you now?”\n\n“Why, children, why Helenette!” cried Duval, who had not felt his daughter’s heart beat against his breast for ten years, “do you want me to die of joy? My poor heart will break! Come, Monsieur Andre, we are quits already.” And the old man strained her to his breast with such fierce and passionate force that she cried out.\n\n“Oh! you are hurting me!” she said.\n\n“I am hurting you!” He grew pale at the words. The pain expressed in his face seemed greater than it is given to humanity to know. The agony of this Christ of paternity can only be compared with the masterpieces of those princes of the palette who have left for us the record of their visions of an agony suffered for a whole world by the Saviour of men. Father Duval pressed his lips very gently against the waist than his fingers had grasped too roughly.\n\n“Oh! no, no,” he cried. “I have not hurt you, have I?” and his smile seemed to repeat the question. “YOU have hurt me with that cry just now.—The things cost rather more than that,” he said in her ear, with another gentle kiss, “but I had to deceive him about it, or he would have been angry.”\n\nAndre sat dumb with amazement in the presence of this inexhaustible love; he gazed at Duval, and his face betrayed the artless admiration which shapes the beliefs of youth.\n\n“I will be worthy of all this,” he cried.\n\n“Oh! my Andre, that is nobly said,” and Mme. de Breuil kissed the law student on the forehead.\n\n“He gave up Mlle. Brunet and her millions for you,” said Father Duval. “Yes, the little thing was in love with you, and now that her brother is dead she is as rich as Croesus.”\n\n“Oh! why did you tell her?” cried Villeneuve.\n\n“Andre,” Helene said in his ear, “I have one regret now this evening. Ah! how I will love you! and for ever!”\n\n“This is the happiest day I have had since you two were married!” cried Duval. “God may send me any suffering, so long as I do not suffer through you, and I can still say, ‘In this short month of February I had more happiness than other men have in their whole lives.’—Look at me, Fifine!” he said to his daughter. “She is very beautiful, is she not? Tell me, now, have you seen many women with that pretty soft color—that little dimple of hers? No, I thought not. Ah, well, and but for me this lovely woman would never have been. And very soon happiness will make her a thousand times lovelier, happiness through you. I could give up my place in heaven to you, neighbor, if needs be, and go down to hell instead. Come, let us have dinner,” he added, scarcely knowing what he said, “everything is ours.”\n\n“Poor dear father!”\n\nHe rose and went over to her, and took her face in his hands, and set a kiss on the plaits of hair. “If you only knew, little one, how happy you can make me—how little it takes to make me happy! Will you come and see me sometimes? I shall be just above, so it is only a step. Promise me, say that you will!”\n\n“Yes, dear father.”\n\n“Say it again.”\n\n“Yes, I will, my kind father.”\n\n“Hush! hush! I should make you say it a hundred times over if I followed my own wishes. Let us have dinner.”\n\nThe three behaved like children that evening, and Father Duval’s spirits were certainly not the least wild. He lay at his daughter’s feet, kissed them, gazed into her eyes, rubbed his head against her dress; in short, no young lover could have been more extravagant or more tender.\n\n“You see!” Helene said with a look at Andre, “so long as my father is with us, he monopolizes me. He will be rather in the way sometimes.”\n\nAndre had himself already felt certain twinges of jealousy, and could not blame this speech that contained the germ of all ingratitude.\n\n“And when will the rooms be ready?” asked Andre, looking round. “We must all leave them this evening, I suppose.”\n\n“Yes, but to-morrow you must come and dine with me,” she answered, with an eloquent glance. “It is our night at the Italiens.”\n\n“I shall go to the pit,” said her father.\n\nIt was midnight. Mme. de Breuil’s carriage was waiting for her, and Father Duval and the student walked back to the Maison Vauquer, talking of Helene, and warming over their talk till there grew up a curious rivalry between the two violent passions. Andre could not help seeing that the father’s self-less love was deeper and more steadfast than his own. For this worshiper Helene was always pure and fair, and her father’s adoration drew its fervor from a whole past as well as a future of love.\n\nThey found Mme. Bouchard by the stove, with Nadine and Benoit to keep her company; the old landlady, sitting like Marius among the ruins of Carthage, was waiting for the two lodgers that yet remained to her, and bemoaning her lot with the sympathetic Nadine. Tasso’s lamentations as recorded in Byron’s poem are undoubtedly eloquent, but for sheer force of truth they fall far short of the widow’s cry from the depths.\n\n“Only three cups of coffee in the morning, Nadine! Oh dear! to have your house emptied in this way is enough to break your heart. What is life, now my lodgers are gone? Nothing at all. Just think of it! It is just as if all the furniture had been taken out of the house, and your furniture is your life. How have I offended heaven to draw down all this trouble upon me? And haricot beans and potatoes laid in for twenty people! The police in my house too! We shall have to live on potatoes now, and Benoit will have to go!”\n\nThe Savoyard, who was fast asleep, suddenly woke up at this, and said, “Madame,” questioningly.\n\n“Poor fellow!” said Nadine, “he is like a dog.”\n\n“In the dead season, too! Nobody is moving now. I would like to know where the lodgers are to drop down from. It drives me distracted. And that old witch of a Lavalle goes and takes Lemaire with her! What can she have done to make him so fond of her? He runs about after her like a little dog.”\n\n“Lord!” said Nadine, flinging up her head, “those old maids are up to all sorts of tricks.”\n\n“There’s that poor M. Lupin that they made out to be a convict,” the widow went on. “Well, you know that is too much for me, Nadine; I can’t bring myself to believe it. Such a lively man as he was, and paid fifteen francs a month for his coffee of an evening, paid you very penny on the nail too.”\n\n“And open-handed he was!” said Benoit.\n\n“There is some mistake,” said Nadine.\n\n“Why, no there isn’t! he said so himself!” said Mme. Bouchard. “And to think that all these things have happened in my house, and in a quarter where you never see a cat go by. On my word as an honest woman, it’s like a dream. For, look here, we saw Louis XVI. meet with his mishap; we saw the fall of the Emperor; and we saw him come back and fall again; there was nothing out of the way in all that, but lodging-houses are not liable to revolutions. You can do without a king, but you must eat all the same; and so long as a decent woman, a de Conflans born and bred, will give you all sorts of good things for dinner, nothing short of the end of the world ought to—but there, it is the end of the world, that is just what it is!”\n\n“And to think that Mlle. Lavalle who made all this mischief is to have a thousand crowns a year for it, so I hear,” cried Nadine.\n\n“Don’t speak of her, she is a wicked woman!” said Mme. Bouchard. “She is going to the Buneaud, who charges less than cost. But the Buneaud is capable of anything; she must have done frightful things, robbed and murdered people in her time. She ought to be put in jail for life instead of that poor dear——”\n\nAndre and Duval rang the door-bell at that moment.\n\n“Ah! here are my two faithful lodgers,” said the widow, sighing.\n\nBut the two faithful lodgers, who retained but shadowy recollections of the misfortunes of their lodging-house, announced to their hostess without more ado that they were about to remove to the Chaussee d’Antin.\n\n“Nadine!” cried the widow, “this is the last straw.—Gentlemen, this will be the death of me! It has quite upset me! There’s a weight on my chest! I am ten years older for this day! Upon my word, I shall go out of my senses! And what is to be done with the haricots!—Oh, well, if I am to be left here all by myself, you shall go to-morrow, Benoit.—Good-night, gentlemen,” and she went.\n\n“What is the matter now?” Andre inquired of Nadine.\n\n“Lord! everybody is going about his business, and that has addled her wits. There! she is crying upstairs. It will do her good to snivel a bit. It’s the first time she has cried since I’ve been with her.”\n\nBy the morning, Mme. Bouchard, to use her own expression, had “made up her mind to it.” True, she still wore a doleful countenance, as might be expected of a woman who had lost all her lodgers, and whose manner of life had been suddenly revolutionized, but she had all her wits about her. Her grief was genuine and profound; it was real pain of mind, for her purse had suffered, the routine of her existence had been broken. A lover’s farewell glance at his lady-love’s window is not more mournful than Mme. Bouchard’s survey of the empty places round her table. Andre administered comfort, telling the widow that Debian, whose term of residence at the hospital was about to expire, would doubtless take his (Villeneuve’s) place; that the official from the Museum had often expressed a desire to have Mme. Coulis’s rooms; and that in a very few days her household would be on the old footing.\n\n“God send it may, my dear sir! but bad luck has come to lodge here. There’ll be a death in the house before ten days are out, you’ll see,” and she gave a lugubrious look round the dining-room. “Whose turn will it be, I wonder?”\n\n“It is just as well that we are moving out,” said Andre to Father Duval in a low voice.\n\n“Madame,” said Nadine, running in with a scared face, “I have not seen Peppin these three days.”\n\n“Ah! well, if my cat is dead, if he has gone and left us, I——”\n\nThe poor woman could not finish her sentence; she clasped her hands and hid her face on the back of her armchair, quite overcome by this dreadful portent.\n\nBy twelve o’clock, when the postman reaches that quarter, Andre received a letter. The dainty envelope bore the Valmont arms on the seal, and contained an invitation to the Vicomtesse’s great ball, which had been talked of in Paris for a month. A little note for Andre was slipped in with the card.\n\n “I think, monsieur, that you will undertake with pleasure to\n  interpret my sentiments to Mme. de Breuil, so I am sending the\n  card for which you asked me to you. I shall be delighted to make\n  the acquaintance of Mme. de Laroche’s sister. Pray introduce that\n  charming lady to me, and do not let her monopolize all your\n  affection, for you owe me not a little in return for mine.\n\n                                         “VICOMTESSE DE BEAUSEANT.”\n \n“Well,” said Andre to himself, as he read the note a second time, “Mme. de Valmont says pretty plainly that she does not want the Baron de Breuil.”\n\nHe went to Helene at once in his joy. He had procured this pleasure for her, and doubtless he would receive the price of it. Mme. de Breuil was dressing. Villeneuve waited in her boudoir, enduring as best he might the natural impatience of an eager temperament for the reward desired and withheld for a year. Such sensations are only known once in a life. The first woman to whom a man is drawn, if she is really a woman—that is to say, if she appears to him amid the splendid accessories that form a necessary background to life in the world of Paris—will never have a rival.\n\nLove in Paris is a thing distinct and apart; for in Paris neither men nor women are the dupes of the commonplaces by which people seek to throw a veil over their motives, or to parade a fine affectation of disinterestedness in their sentiments. In this country within a country, it is not merely required of a woman that she should satisfy the senses and the soul; she knows perfectly well that she has still greater obligations to discharge, that she must fulfil the countless demands of a vanity that enters into every fibre of that living organism called society. Love, for her, is above all things, and by its very nature, a vainglorious, brazen-fronted, ostentatious, thriftless charlatan. If at the Court of Charles XV. there was not a woman but envied Mlle. des Armes the reckless devotion of passion that led the grand monarch to tear the priceless ruffles at his wrists in order to assist the entry of a Duc de Vermandois into the world—what can you expect of the rest of society? You must have youth and wealth and rank; nay, you must, if possible, have more than these, for the more incense you bring with you to burn at the shrine of the god, the more favorably will he regard the worshiper. Love is a religion, and his cult must in the nature of things be more costly than those of all other deities; Love the Spoiler stays for a moment, and then passes on; like the urchin of the streets, his course may be traced by the ravages that he has made. The wealth of feeling and imagination is the poetry of the garret; how should love exist there without that wealth?\n\nIf there are exceptions who do not subscribe to these Draconian laws of the Parisian code, they are solitary examples. Such souls live so far out of the main current that they are not borne away by the doctrines of society; they dwell beside some clear spring of everflowing water, without seeking to leave the green shade; happy to listen to the echoes of the infinite in everything around them and in their own souls, waiting in patience to take their flight for heaven, while they look with pity upon those of earth.\n\nVilleneuve, like most young men who have been early impressed by the circumstances of power and grandeur, meant to enter the lists fully armed; the burning ambition of conquest possessed him already; perhaps he was conscious of his powers, but as yet he knew neither the end to which his ambition was to be directed, nor the means of attaining it. In default of the pure and sacred love that fills a life, ambition may become something very noble, subduing to itself every thought of personal interest, and setting as the end—the greatness, not of one man, but of a whole nation.\n\nBut the student had not yet reached the time of life when a man surveys the whole course of existence and judges it soberly. Hitherto he had scarcely so much as shaken off the spell of the fresh and gracious influences that envelop a childhood in the country, like green leaves and grass. He had hesitated on the brink of the Parisian Rubicon, and in spite of the prickings of ambition, he still clung to a lingering tradition of an old ideal—the peaceful life of the noble in his chateau. But yesterday evening, at the sight of his rooms, those scruples had vanished. He had learned what it was to enjoy the material advantages of fortune, as he had already enjoyed the social advantages of birth; he ceased to be a provincial from that moment, and slipped naturally and easily into a position which opened up a prospect of a brilliant future.\n\nSo, as he waited for Helene, in the pretty boudoir, where he felt that he had a certain right to be, he felt himself so far away from the Villeneuve who came back to Paris a year ago, that, turning some power of inner vision upon this latter, he asked himself whether that past self bore any resemblance to the Villeneuve of that moment.\n\n“Madame is in her room,” Sophie came to tell him. The woman’s voice made him start.\n\nHe found Helene lying back in her low chair by the fireside, looking fresh and bright. The sight of her among the flowing draperies of muslin suggested some beautiful tropical flower, where the fruit is set amid the blossom.\n\n“Well,” she said, with a tremor in her voice, “here you are.”\n\n“Guess what I bring for you,” said Andre, sitting down beside her. He took possession of her arm to kiss her hand.\n\nMme. de Breuil gave a joyful start as she saw the card. She turned to Andre; there were tears in her eyes as she flung her arms about his neck, and drew him towards her in a frenzy of gratified vanity.\n\n“And I owe this happiness to you—to thee” (she whispered the more intimate word in his ear); “but Sophie is in my dressing-room, let us be prudent.—This happiness—yes, for I may call it so, when it comes to me through you—is surely more than a triumph for self-love? No one has been willing to introduce me into that set. Perhaps just now I may seem to you to be frivolous, petty, shallow, like a Parisienne, but remember, my friend, that I am ready to give up all for you; and that if I long more than ever for an entrance into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, it is because I shall meet you there.”\n\n“Mme. de Valmont’s note seems to say very plainly that she does not expect to see the Baron de Breuil at her ball; don’t you think so?” said Andre.\n\n“Why, yes,” said the Baroness as she returned the letter. “Those women have a talent for insolence. But it is of no consequence, I shall go. My sister is sure to be there, and sure to be very beautifully dressed.—Andre,” she went on, lowering her voice, “she will go to dispel ugly suspicions. You do not know the things that people are saying about her. Only this morning Breuil came to tell me that they had been discussing her at the club. Great heavens! on what does a woman’s character and the honor of a whole family depend! I feel that I am nearly touched and wounded in my poor sister. According to some people, M. de Lavergne must have put his name to bills for a hundred thousand francs, nearly all of them are overdue, and proceedings are threatened. In this predicament, it seems that my sister sold her diamonds to a Jew—the beautiful diamonds that belonged to her husband’s mother, Mme. de Laroche the elder,—you have seen her wearing them. In fact, nothing else has been talked about for the last two days. So I can see that Camille is sure to come to Mme. de Valmont’s ball in tissue of gold, and ablaze with diamonds, to draw all eyes upon her; and I will not be outshone. She has tried to eclipse me all her life, she has never been kind to me, and I have helped her so often, and always had money for her when she had none.—But never mind other people now, to-day I mean to be perfectly happy.”\n\nAt one o’clock that morning Andre was still with Mme. de Breuil. In the midst of their lovers’ farewell, a farewell full of hope of bliss to come, she said in a troubled voice, “I am very fearful, superstitious. Give what name you like to my presentiments, but I am afraid that my happiness will be paid for by some horrible catastrophe.”\n\n“Child!” said Andre.\n\n“Ah! have we changed places, and am I the child to-night?” she asked, laughingly.\n\nAndre went back to the Maison Vauquer, never doubting but that he should leave it for good on the morrow; and on the way he fell to dreaming the bright dreams of youth, when the cup of happiness has left its sweetness on the lips.\n\n“Well?” cried Duval, as Villeneuve passed by his door.\n\n“Yes,” said Andre; “I will tell you everything to-morrow.”\n\n“Everything, will you not?” cried the old man. “Go to bed. To-morrow our happy life will begin.”\n\nNext day, Duval and Villeneuve were ready to leave the lodging-house, and only awaited the good pleasure of a porter to move out of it; but towards noon there was a sound of wheels in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and a carriage stopped before the door of the Maison Vauquer. Mme. de Breuil alighted, and asked if her father was still in the house, and, receiving an affirmative reply from Nadine, ran lightly upstairs.\n\nIt so happened that Andre was at home all unknown to his neighbor. At breakfast time he had asked Duval to superintend the removal of his goods, saying that he would meet him in the Rue d’Artois at four o’clock; but Villeneuve’s name had been called early on the list at the Ecole de Droit, and he had gone back at once to the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. No one had seen him come in, for Duval had gone to find a porter, and the mistress of the house was likewise out. Andre had thought to pay her himself, for it struck him that if he left this, Duval in his zeal would probably pay for him. As it was, Andre went up to his room to see that nothing had been forgotten, and blessed his foresight when he saw the blank bill bearing Lupin’s signature lying in the drawer where he had carelessly thrown it on the day when he had repaid the amount. There was no fire in the grate, so he was about to tear it into little pieces, when he heard a voice speaking in Duval’s room, and the speaker was Helene! He made no more noise, and stood still to listen, thinking that she should have no secrets from him; but after the first few words, the conversation between the father and daughter was so strange and interesting that it absorbed all his attention.\n\n“Ah! thank heaven that you thought of asking him to give an account of the money settled on me before I was utterly ruined, father. Is it safe to talk?” she added.\n\n“Yes, there is no one in the house,” said her father faintly.\n\n“What is the matter with you?” asked Mme. de Breuil.\n\n“God forgive you! you have just dealt me a staggering blow, child!” said the old man. “You cannot know how much I love you, or you would not have burst in upon me like this, with such news, especially if all is not lost. Has something so important happened that you must come here about it? In a few minutes we should have been in the Rue d’Artois.”\n\n“Eh! does one think what one is doing after a catastrophe? It has turned my head. Your attorney has found out the state of things now, but it was bound to come out sooner or later. We shall want your long business experience; and I come to you like a drowning man who catches at a branch. When M. Moreau found that Breuil was throwing all sorts of difficulties in his way, he threatened him with proceedings, and told him plainly that he would soon obtain an order from the President of the Tribunal. So Breuil came to my room this morning, and asked if I meant to ruin us both. I told him that I knew nothing whatever about it, that I had a fortune, and ought to be put into possession of my fortune, and that my attorney was acting for me in the matter; I said again that I knew absolutely nothing about it, and could not possibly go into the subject with him. Wasn’t that what you told me to tell him?”\n\n“Yes, quite right,” answered Duval.\n\n“Well, then,” Helene continued, “he told me all about his affairs. He had just invested all his capital and mine in business speculations; they have only just been started, and very large sums of money are locked up. If I were to compel him to refund my dowry now, he would be forced to file his petition; but if I will wait a year, he undertakes, on his honor, to double or treble my fortune, by investing it in building land, and I shall be mistress at last of the whole of my property. He was speaking the truth, father dear; he frightened me! He asked my pardon for his conduct; he has given me my liberty; I am free to act as I please on condition that I leave him to carry on my business in my name. To prove his sincerity, he promised that M. Moreau might inspect the accounts as often as I pleased, so that I might be assured that everything was being conducted properly. In short, he put himself in my power, bound hand and foot. He wishes the present arrangements as to the expenses of housekeeping to continue for two more years, and entreated me not to exceed my allowance. He showed me plainly that it was all that he could do to keep up appearances; he has broken with his opera dancer; he will be compelled to practise the most strict economy (in secret) if he is to bide his time with unshaken credit. I scolded, I did all I could to drive him to desperation, so as to find out more. He showed me his ledgers—he broke down and cried at last. I never saw a man in such a state. He lost his head completely, talked of killing himself, and raved till I felt quite sorry for him.”\n\n“Do you really believe that silly rubbish?”... cried her father. “It was all got up for your benefit! I have had to do with Germans in the way of business, honest and straightforward they are pretty sure to be, but when with their simplicity and frankness they are sharpers and humbugs as well, they are the worst rogues of all. Your husband is taking advantage of you. As soon as pressure is brought to bear on him he shams dead; he means to be more the master under your name than in his own. He will take advantage of the position to secure himself against the risks of business. He is as sharp as he is treacherous; he is a bad lot! No, no; I am not going to leave my girls behind me without a penny when I go to Pere-Lachaise. I know something about business still. He has sunk his money in speculation, he says; very well then, there is something to show for it—bills, receipts, papers of some sort. Let him produce them, and come to an arrangement with you. We will choose the most promising of his speculations, take them over at our own risk, and have the securities transferred into your name; they shall represent the separate estate of Helene Duval, wife of the Baron de Breuil. Does that fellow really take us for idiots? Does he imagine that I could stand the idea of your being without fortune, without bread, for forty-eight hours? I would not stand it a day—no, not a night, not a couple of hours! If there had been any foundation for the idea, I should never get over it. What! I have worked hard for forty years, carried sacks on my back, and sweated and pinched and saved all my life for you, my darlings, for you who made the toil and every burden borne for you seem light; and now, my fortune, my whole life, is to vanish in smoke! I should die raving mad if I believed a word of it. By all that’s holiest in heaven and earth, we will have this cleared up at once; go through the books, have the whole business looked thoroughly into! I will not sleep, nor rest, nor eat until I have satisfied myself that all your fortune is in existence. Your money is settled upon you, God be thanked! and, luckily, your attorney, Maitre Moreau, is an honest man. Good Lord! you shall have your snug little million, your fifty thousand francs a year, as long as you live, or I will raise a racket in Paris, I will so! If the Tribunals put upon us, I will appeal to the Chambers. If I knew that you were well and comfortably off as far as money is concerned, that thought would keep me easy in spite of bad health and troubles. Money? why, it is life! Money does everything. That great dolt of an Alsatian shall sing to another tune! Look here, Helene, don’t give way, don’t make a concession of half a quarter of a",

    "context": "ality. Once they did go to a masquerade dance in the pavilion at one of the hotels up the lake, and had a glorious evening, but slipped away in their canoe, before unmasking time, back to the Blue Castle.\n\n“It was lovely—but I don’t want to go again,” said Elara.\n\nSo many hours a day Rowan shut himself up in Bluebeard’s Chamber. Elara never saw the inside of it. From the smells that filtered through at times she concluded he must be conducting chemical experiments—or counterfeiting money. Elara supposed there must be smelly processes in making counterfeit money. But she did not trouble herself about it. She had no desire to peer into the locked chambers of Rowan’s house of life. His past and his future concerned her not. Only this rapturous present. Nothing else mattered.\n\nOnce he went away and stayed away two days and nights. He had asked Elara if she would be afraid to stay alone and she had said she would not. He never told her where he had been. She was not afraid to be alone, but she was horribly lonely. The sweetest sound she had ever heard was Lady Cordelia’s clatter through the woods when Rowan returned. And then his signal whistle from the shore. She ran down to the landing rock to greet him—to nestle herself into his eager arms—they did seem eager.\n\n“Have you missed me, Moonlight?” Rowan was whispering.\n\n“It seems a hundred years since you went away,” said Elara.\n\n“I won’t leave you again.”\n\n“You must,” protested Elara, “if you want to. I’d be miserable if I thought you wanted to go and didn’t, because of me. I want you to feel perfectly free.”\n\nRowan laughed—a little cynically.\n\n“There is no such thing as freedom on earth,” he said. “Only different kinds of bondages. And comparative bondages. You think you are free now because you’ve escaped from a peculiarly unbearable kind of bondage. But are you? You love me—that’s a bondage.”\n\n“Who said or wrote that ‘the prison unto which we doom ourselves no prison is’?” asked Elara dreamily, clinging to his arm as they climbed up the rock steps.\n\n“Ah, now you have it,” said Rowan. “That’s all the freedom we can hope for—the freedom to choose our prison. But, Moonlight,”—he stopped at the door of the Blue Castle and looked about him—at the glorious lake, the great, shadowy woods, the bonfires, the twinkling lights—“Moonlight, I’m glad to be home again. When I came down through the woods and saw my home lights—mine—gleaming out under the old pines—something I’d never seen before—oh, girl, I was glad—glad!”\n\nBut in spite of Rowan’s doctrine of bondage, Elara thought they were splendidly free. It was amazing to be able to sit up half the night and look at the moon if you wanted to. To be late for meals if you wanted to—she who had always been rebuked so sharply by her mother and so reproachfully by Cousin Thistle if she were one minute late. Dawdle over meals as long as you wanted to. Leave your crusts if you wanted to. Not come home at all for meals if you wanted to. Sit on a sun-warm rock and paddle your bare feet in the hot sand if you wanted to. Just sit and do nothing in the beautiful silence if you wanted to. In short, do any fool thing you wanted to whenever the notion took you. If that wasn’t freedom, what was?\n\nCHAPTER XXX\nThey didn’t spend all their days on the island. They spent more than half of them wandering at will through the enchanted Muskoka country. Rowan knew the woods as a book and he taught their lore and craft to Elara. He could always find trail and haunt of the shy wood people. Elara learned the different fairy-likenesses of the mosses—the charm and exquisiteness of woodland blossoms. She learned to know every bird at sight and mimic its call—though never so perfectly as Rowan. She made friends with every kind of tree. She learned to paddle a canoe as well as Rowan himself. She liked to be out in the rain and she never caught cold.\n\nSometimes they took a lunch with them and went berrying—strawberries and blueberries. How pretty blueberries were—the dainty green of the unripe berries, the glossy pinks and scarlets of the half ripes, the misty blue of the fully matured! And Elara learned the real flavour of the strawberry in its highest perfection. There was a certain sunlit dell on the banks of Mistawis along which white birches grew on one side and on the other still, changeless ranks of young spruces. There were long grasses at the roots of the birches, combed down by the winds and wet with morning dew late into the afternoons. Here they found berries that might have graced the banquets of Lucullus, great ambrosial sweetnesses hanging like rubies to long, rosy stalks. They lifted them by the stalk and ate them from it, uncrushed and virgin, tasting each berry by itself with all its wild fragrance ensphered therein. When Elara carried any of these berries home that elusive essence escaped and they became nothing more than the common berries of the market-place—very kitchenly good indeed, but not as they would have been, eaten in their birch dell until her fingers were stained as pink as Aurora’s eyelids.\n\nOr they went after water-lilies. Rowan knew where to find them in the creeks and bays of Mistawis. Then the Blue Castle was glorious with them, every receptacle that Elara could contrive filled with the exquisite things. If not water lilies then cardinal flowers, fresh and vivid from the swamps of Mistawis, where they burned like ribbons of flame.\n\nSometimes they went trouting on little nameless rivers or hidden brooks on whose banks Naiads might have sunned their white, wet limbs. Then all they took with them were some raw potatoes and salt. They roasted the potatoes over a fire and Rowan showed Elara how to cook the trout by wrapping them in leaves, coating them with mud and baking them in a bed of hot coals. Never were such delicious meals. Elara had such an appetite it was no wonder she put flesh on her bones.\n\nOr they just prowled and explored through woods that always seemed to be expecting something wonderful to happen. At least, that was the way Elara felt about them. Down the next hollow—over the next hill—you would find it.\n\n“We don’t know where we’re going, but isn’t it fun to go?” Rowan used to say.\n\nOnce or twice night overtook them, too far from their Blue Castle to get back. But Rowan made a fragrant bed of bracken and fir boughs and they slept on it dreamlessly, under a ceiling of old spruces with moss hanging from them, while beyond them moonlight and the murmur of pines blended together so that one could hardly tell which was light and which was sound.\n\nThere were rainy days, of course, when Muskoka was a wet green land. Days when showers drifted across Mistawis like pale ghosts of rain and they never thought of staying in because of it. Days when it rained in right good earnest and they had to stay in. Then Rowan shut himself up in Bluebeard’s Chamber and Elara read, or dreamed on the wolfskins with Fortune purring beside her and Mandolin watching them suspiciously from his own peculiar chair. On Sunday evenings they paddled across to a point of land and walked from there through the woods to the little Free Methodist church. One felt really too happy for Sunday. Elara had never really liked Sundays before.\n\nAnd always, Sundays and weekdays, she was with Rowan. Nothing else really mattered. And what a companion he was! How understanding! How jolly! How—how Rowan-like! That summed it all up.\n\nElara had taken some of her two hundred dollars out of the bank and spent it in pretty clothes. She had a little smoke-blue chiffon which she always put on when they spent the evening at home—smoke-blue with touches of silver about it. It was after she began wearing it that Rowan began calling her Moonlight.\n\n“Moonlight and blue twilight—that is what you look like in that dress. I like it. It belongs to you. You aren’t exactly pretty, but you have some adorable beauty-spots. Your eyes. And that little kissable dent just between your collar bones. You have the wrist and ankle of an aristocrat. That little head of yours is beautifully shaped. And when you look backward over your shoulder you’re maddening—especially in twilight or moonlight. An elf maiden. A wood sprite. You belong to the woods, Moonlight—you should never be out of them. In spite of your ancestry, there is something wild and remote and untamed about you. And you have such a nice, sweet, throaty, summery voice. Such a nice voice for love-making.”\n\n“Shure an’ ye’ve kissed the Blarney Stone,” scoffed Elara. But she tasted these compliments for weeks.\n\nShe got a pale green bathing-suit, too—a garment which would have given her clan their deaths if they had ever seen her in it. Rowan taught her how to swim. Sometimes she put her bathing-dress on when she got up and didn’t take it off until she went to bed—running down to the water for a plunge whenever she felt like it and sprawling on the sun-warm rocks to dry.\n\nShe had forgotten all the old humiliating things that used to come up against her in the night—the injustices and the disappointments. It was as if they had all happened to some other person—not to her, Elara Callister, who had always been happy.\n\n“I understand now what it means to be born again,” she told Rowan.\n\nLocke speaks of grief “staining backward” through the pages of life; but Elara found her happiness had stained backward likewise and flooded with rose-colour her whole previous drab existence. She found it hard to believe that she had ever been lonely and unhappy and afraid.\n\n“When death comes, I shall have lived,” thought Elara. “I shall have had my hour.”\n\nAnd her dust-pile!\n\nOne day Elara had heaped up the sand in the little island cove in a tremendous cone and stuck a gay little Union Jack on top of it.\n\n“What are you celebrating?” Rowan wanted to know.\n\n“I’m just exorcising an old demon,” Elara told him.\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\nAutumn came. Late September with cool nights. They had to forsake the verandah; but they kindled a fire in the big fireplace and sat before it with jest and laughter. They left the doors open, and Mandolin and Fortune came and went at pleasure. Sometimes they sat gravely on the bearskin rug between Rowan and Elara; sometimes they slunk off into the mystery of the chill night outside. The stars smouldered in the horizon mists through the old oriel. The haunting, persistent croon of the pine-trees filled the air. The little waves began to make soft, sobbing splashes on the rocks below them in the rising winds. They needed no light but the firelight that sometimes leaped up and revealed them—sometimes shrouded them in shadow. When the night wind rose higher Rowan would shut the door and light a lamp and read to her—poetry and essays and gorgeous, dim chronicles of ancient wars. Rowan never would read novels: he vowed they bored him. But sometimes she read them herself, curled up on the wolf skins, laughing aloud in peace. For Rowan was not one of those aggravating people who can never hear you smiling audibly over something you’ve read without inquiring placidly, “What is the joke?”\n\nOctober—with a gorgeous pageant of color around Mistawis, into which Elara plunged her soul. Never had she imagined anything so splendid. A great, tinted peace. Blue, wind-winnowed skies. Sunlight sleeping in the glades of that fairyland. Long dreamy purple days paddling idly in their canoe along shores and up the rivers of crimson and gold. A sleepy, red hunter’s moon. Enchanted tempests that stripped the leaves from the trees and heaped them along the shores. Flying shadows of clouds. What had all the smug, opulent lands out front to compare with this?\n\nNovember—with uncanny witchery in its changed trees. With murky red sunsets flaming in smoky crimson behind the westering hills. With dear days when the austere woods were beautiful and gracious in a dignified serenity of folded hands and closed eyes—days full of a fine, pale sunshine that sifted through the late, leafless gold of the juniper-trees and glimmered among the grey beeches, lighting up evergreen banks of moss and washing the colonnades of the pines. Days with a high-sprung sky of flawless turquoise. Days when an exquisite melancholy seemed to hang over the landscape and dream about the lake. But days, too, of the wild blackness of great autumn storms, followed by dank, wet, streaming nights when there was witch-laughter in the pines and fitful moans among the mainland trees. What cared they? Old Arthur had built his roof well, and his chimney drew.\n\n“Warm fire—books—comfort—safety from storm—our cats on the rug. Moonlight,” said Rowan, “would you be any happier now if you had a million dollars?”\n\n“No—nor half so happy. I’d be bored by conventions and obligations then.”\n\nDecember. Early snows and Orion. The pale fires of the Milky Way. It was really winter now—wonderful, cold, starry winter. How Elara had always hated winter! Dull, brief, uneventful days. Long, cold, companionless nights. Cousin Thistle with her back that had to be rubbed continually. Cousin Thistle making weird noises gargling her throat in the mornings. Cousin Thistle whining over the price of coal. Her mother, probing, questioning, ignoring. Endless colds and bronchitis—or the dread of it. Hawke’s Liniment and Purple Pills.\n\nBut now she loved winter. Winter was beautiful “up back”—almost intolerably beautiful. Days of clear brilliance. Evenings that were like cups of glamour—the purest vintage of winter’s wine. Nights with their fire of stars. Cold, exquisite winter sunrises. Lovely ferns of ice all over the windows of the Blue Castle. Moonlight on birches in a silver thaw. Ragged shadows on windy evenings—torn, twisted, fantastic shadows. Great silences, austere and searching. Jewelled, barbaric hills. The sun suddenly breaking through grey clouds over long, white Mistawis. Icy-grey twilights, broken by snow-squalls, when their cosy living-room, with its goblins of firelight and inscrutable cats seemed cosier than ever. Every hour brought a new revelation and wonder.\n\nRowan ran Lady Cordelia into Thaddeus Greeley’s barn and taught Elara how to snowshoe—Elara, who ought to be laid up with bronchitis. But Elara had not even a cold. Later on in the winter Rowan had a terrible one and Elara nursed him through it with a dread of pneumonia in her heart. But Elara’s colds seemed to have gone where old moons go. Which was luck—for she hadn’t even Hawke’s Liniment. She had thoughtfully bought a bottle at the Port and Rowan had hurled it into frozen Mistawis with a scowl.\n\n“Bring no more of that devilish stuff here,” he had ordered briefly. It was the first and last time he had spoken harshly to her.\n\nThey went for long tramps through the exquisite reticence of winter woods and the silver jungles of frosted trees, and found loveliness everywhere.\n\nAt times they seemed to be walking through a spellbound world of crystal and pearl, so white and radiant were clearings and lakes and sky. The air was so crisp and clear that it was half intoxicating.\n\nOnce they stood in a hesitation of ecstasy at the entrance of a narrow path between ranks of birches. Every twig and spray was outlined in snow. The undergrowth along its sides was a little fairy forest cut out of marble. The shadows cast by the pale sunshine were fine and spiritual.\n\n“Come away,” said Rowan, turning. “We must not commit the desecration of tramping through there.”\n\nOne evening they came upon a snowdrift far back in an old clearing which was in the exact likeness of a beautiful woman’s profile. Seen too close by, the resemblance was lost, as in the fairy-tale of the Castle of St. John. Seen from behind, it was a shapeless oddity. But at just the right distance and angle the outline was so perfect that when they came suddenly upon it, gleaming out against the dark background of spruce in the glow of that winter sunset they both exclaimed in amazement. There was a low, noble brow, a straight, classic nose, lips and chin and cheek-curve modelled as if some goddess of old time had sat to the sculptor, and a breast of such cold, swelling purity as the very spirit of the winter woods might display.\n\n“‘All the beauty that old Greece and Rome, sung painted, taught,’” quoted Rowan.\n\n“And to think no human eyes save ours have seen or will see it,” breathed Elara, who felt at times as if she were living in a book by Ian Rowlston. As she looked around her she recalled some passages she had marked in the new Foster book Rowan had brought her from the Port—with an adjuration not to expect him to read or listen to it.\n\n“‘All the tintings of winter woods are extremely delicate and elusive,’” recalled Elara. “‘When the brief afternoon wanes and the sun just touches the tops of the hills, there seems to be all over the woods an abundance, not of colour, but of the spirit of colour. There is really nothing but pure white after all, but one has the impression of fairy-like blendings of rose and violet, opal and heliotrope on the slopes—in the dingles and along the curves of the forest-land. You feel sure the tint is there, but when you look at it directly it is gone. From the corner of your eye you are aware that it is lurking over yonder in a spot where there was nothing but pale purity a moment ago. Only just when the sun is setting is there a fleeting moment of real colour. Then the redness streams out over the snow and incarnadines the hills and rivers and smites the crest of the pines with flame. Just a few minutes of transfiguration and revelation—and it is gone.’\n\n“I wonder if Ian Rowlston ever spent a winter in Mistawis,” said Elara.\n\n“Not likely,” scoffed Rowan. “People who write tosh like that generally write it in a warm house on some smug city street.”\n\n“You are too hard on Ian Rowlston,” said Elara severely. “No one could have written that little paragraph I read you last night without having seen it first—you know he couldn’t.”\n\n“I didn’t listen to it,” said Rowan morosely. “You know I told you I wouldn’t.”\n\n“Then you’ve got to listen to it now,” persisted Elara. She made him stand still on his snowshoes while she repeated it.\n\n“‘She is a rare artist, this old Matron Nature, who works “for the joy of working” and not in any spirit of vain show. Today the fir woods are a symphony of greens and greys, so subtle that you cannot tell where one shade begins to be the other. Grey trunk, green bough, grey-green moss above the white, grey-shadowed floor. Yet the old gypsy doesn’t like unrelieved monotones. She must have a dash of colour. See it. A broken dead fir bough, of a beautiful red-brown, swinging among the beards of moss.’”\n\n“Good Lord, do you learn all that fellow’s books by heart?” was Rowan’s disgusted reaction as he strode off.\n\n“Ian Rowlston’s books were all that saved my soul alive the past five years,” averred Elara. “Oh, Rowan, look at that exquisite filigree of snow in the furrows of that old elm-tree trunk.”\n\nWhen they came out to the lake they changed from snowshoes to skates and skated home. For a wonder Elara had learned, when she was a little schoolgirl, to skate on the pond behind the Deerwood school. She never had any skates of her own, but some of the other girls had lent her theirs and she seemed to have a natural knack of it. Uncle Eldridge had once promised her a pair of skates for Christmas, but when Christmas came he had given her rubbers instead. She had never skated since she grew up, but the old trick came back quickly, and glorious were the hours she and Rowan spent skimming over the white lakes and past the dark islands where the summer cottages were closed and silent. Tonight they flew down Mistawis before the wind, in an exhilaration that crimsoned Elara’s cheeks under her white tam. And at the end was her dear little house, on the island of pines, with a coating of snow on its roof, sparkling in the moonlight. Its windows glinted impishly at her in the stay gleams.\n\n“Looks exactly like a picture-book, doesn’t it?” said Rowan.\n\nThey had a lovely Christmas. No rush. No scramble. No niggling attempts to make ends meet. No wild effort to remember whether she hadn’t given the same kind of present to the same person two Christmases before—no mob of last-minute shoppers—no dreary family “reunions” where she sat mute and unimportant—no attacks of “nerves.” They decorated the Blue Castle with pine boughs, and Elara made delightful little tinsel stars and hung them up amid the greenery. She cooked a dinner to which Rowan did full justice, while Fortune and Mandolin picked the bones.\n\n“A land that can produce a goose like that is an admirable land,” vowed Rowan. “Canada forever!” And they drank to the Union Jack a bottle of dandelion wine that Cousin Lydia had given Elara along with the bedspread.\n\n“One never knows,” Cousin Lydia had said solemnly, “when one may need a little stimulant.”\n\nRowan had asked Elara what she wanted for a Christmas present.\n\n“Something frivolous and unnecessary,” said Elara, who had got a pair of goloshes last Christmas and two long-sleeved, woolen undervests the year before. And so on back.\n\nTo her delight, Rowan gave her a necklace of pearl beads. Elara had wanted a string of milky pearl beads—like congealed moonshine—all her life. And these were so pretty. All that worried her was that they were really too good. They must have cost a great deal—fifteen dollars, at least. Could Rowan afford that? She didn’t know a thing about his finances. She had refused to let him buy any of her clothes—she had enough for that, she told him, as long as she would need clothes. In a round, black jar on the chimney-piece Rowan put money for their household expenses—always enough. The jar was never empty, though Elara never caught him replenishing it. He couldn’t have much, of course, and that necklace—but Elara tossed care aside. She would wear it and enjoy it. It was the first pretty thing she had ever had.\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\nNew Year. The old, shabby, inglorious outlived calendar came down. The new one went up. January was a month of storms. It snowed for three weeks on end. The thermometer went miles below zero and stayed there. But, as Rowan and Elara pointed out to each other, there were no mosquitoes. And the roar and crackle of their big fire drowned the howls of the north wind. Fortune and Mandolin waxed fat and developed resplendent coats of thick, silky fur. Nip and Tuck had gone.\n\n“But they’ll come back in spring,” promised Rowan.\n\nThere was no monotony. Sometimes they had dramatic little private spats that never even thought of becoming quarrels. Sometimes Thaddeus Greeley dropped in—for an evening or a whole day—with his old tartan cap and his long red beard coated with snow. He generally brought his fiddle and played for them, to the delight of all except Mandolin, who would go temporarily insane and retreat under Elara’s bed. Sometimes Thaddeus and Rowan talked while Elara made candy for them; sometimes they sat and smoked in silence à la Tennyson and Carlyle, until the Blue Castle reeked and Elara fled to the open. Sometimes they played checkers fiercely and silently the whole night through. Sometimes they all ate the russet apples Thaddeus had brought, while the jolly old clock ticked the delightful minutes away.\n\n“A plate of apples, an open fire, and ‘a jolly goode booke whereon to looke’ are a fair substitute for heaven,” vowed Rowan. “Any one can have the streets of gold. Let’s have another whack at Carman.”\n\nIt was easier now for the Stirlings to believe Elara of the dead. Not even dim rumours of her having been over at the Port came to trouble them, though she and Rowan used to skate there occasionally to see a movie and eat hot dogs shamelessly at the corner stand afterwards. Presumably none of the Stirlings ever thought about her—except Cousin Lydia, who used to lie awake worrying about poor El. Did she have enough to eat? Was that dreadful creature good to her? Was she warm enough at nights?\n\nElara was quite warm at nights. She used to wake up and revel silently in the cosiness of those winter nights on that little island in the frozen lake. The nights of other winters had been so cold and long. Elara hated to wake up in them and think about the bleakness and emptiness of the day that had passed and the bleakness and emptiness of the day that would come. Now, she almost counted that night lost on which she didn’t wake up and lie awake for half an hour just being happy, while Rowan’s regular breathing went on beside her, and through the open door the smouldering brands in the fireplace winked at her in the gloom. It was very nice to feel a little Lucky cat jump up on your bed in the darkness and snuggle down at your feet, purring; but Mandolin would be sitting dourly by himself out in front of the fire like a brooding demon. At such moments Mandolin was anything but canny, but Elara loved his uncanniness.\n\nThe side of the bed had to be right against the window. There was no other place for it in the tiny room. Elara, lying there, could look out of the window, through the big pine boughs that actually touched it, away up Mistawis, white and lustrous as a pavement of pearl, or dark and terrible in the storm. Sometimes the pine boughs tapped against the panes with friendly signals. Sometimes she heard the little hissing whisper of snow against them right at her side. Some nights the whole outer world seemed given over to the empery of silence; then came nights when there would be a majestic sweep of wind in the pines; nights of dear starlight when it whistled freakishly and joyously around the Blue Castle; brooding nights before storm when it crept along the floor of the lake with a low, wailing cry of boding and mystery. Elara wasted many perfectly good sleeping hours in these delightful communings. But she could sleep as long in the morning as she wanted to. Nobody cared. Rowan cooked his own breakfast of bacon and eggs and then shut himself up in Bluebeard’s Chamber till supper time. Then they had an evening of reading and talk. They talked about everything in this world and a good many things in other worlds. They laughed over their own jokes until the Blue Castles re-echoed.\n\n“You do laugh beautifully,” Rowan told her once. “It makes me want to laugh just to hear you laugh. There’s a trick about your laugh—as if there were so much more fun back of it that you wouldn’t let out. Did you laugh like that before you came to Mistawis, Moonlight?”\n\n“I never laughed at all—really. I used to giggle foolishly when I felt I was expected to. But now—the laugh just comes.”\n\nIt struck Elara more than once that Rowan himself laughed a great deal oftener than he used to and that his laugh had changed. It had become wholesome. She rarely heard the little cynical note in it now. Could a man laugh like that who had crimes on his conscience? Yet Rowan must have done something. Elara had indifferently made up her mind as to what he had done. She concluded he was a defaulting bank cashier. She had found in one of Rowan’s books an old clipping cut from a Montreal paper in which a vanished, defaulting cashier was described. The description applied to Rowan—as well as to half a dozen other men Elara knew—and from some casual remarks he had dropped from time to time she concluded he knew Montreal rather well. Elara had it all figured out in the back of her mind. Rowan had been in a bank. He was tempted to take some money to speculate—meaning, of course, to put it back. He had got in deeper and deeper, until he found there was nothing for it but flight. It had happened so to scores of men. He had, Elara was absolutely certain, never meant to do wrong. Of course, the name of the man in the clipping was Alistair Dunne. But Elara had always thought Callister was an alias. Not that it mattered.\n\nElara had only one unhappy night that winter. It came in late March when most of the snow had gone and Nip and Tuck had returned. Rowan had gone off in the afternoon for a long, woodland tramp, saying he would be back by dark if all went well. Soon after he had gone it had begun to snow. The wind rose and presently Mistawis was in the grip of one of the worst storms of the winter. It tore up the lake and struck at the little house. The dark angry woods on the mainland scowled at Elara, menace in the toss of their boughs, threats in their windy gloom, terror in the roar of their hearts. The trees on the island crouched in fear. Elara spent the night huddled on the rug before the fire, her face buried in her hands, when she was not vainly peering from the oriel in a futile effort to see through the furious smoke of wind and snow that had once been blue-dimpled Mistawis. Where was Rowan? Lost on the merciless lakes? Sinking exhausted in the drifts of the pathless woods? Elara died a hundred deaths that night and paid in full for all the happiness of her Blue Castle. When morning came the storm broke and cleared; the sun shone gloriously over Mistawis; and at noon Rowan came home. Elara saw him from the oriel as he came around a wooded point, slender and black against the glistening white world. She did not run to meet him. Something happened to her knees and she dropped down on Mandolin’s chair. Luckily Mandolin got out from under in time, his whiskers bristling with indignation. Rowan found her there, her head buried in her hands.\n\n“Rowan, I thought you were dead,” she whispered.\n\nRowan hooted.\n\n“After two years of the Klondike did you think a baby storm like this could get me? I spent the night in that old lumber shanty over by Muskoka. A bit cold but snug enough. Little goose! Your eyes look like burnt holes in a blanket. Did you sit up here all night worrying over an old woodsman like me?”\n\n“Yes,” said Elara. “I—couldn’t help it. The storm seemed so wild. Anybody might have been lost in it. When—I saw you—come round the point—there—something happened to me. I don’t know what. It was as if I had died and come back to life. I can’t describe it any other way.”\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\nSpring. Mistawis black and sullen for a week or two, then flaming in sapphire and turquoise, lilac and rose again, laughing through the oriel, caressing its amethyst islands, rippling under winds soft as silk. Frogs, little green wizards of swamp and pool, singing everywhere in the long twilights and long into the nights; islands fairy-like in a green haze; the evanescent beauty of wild young trees in early leaf; frost-like loveliness of the new foliage of juniper-trees; the woods putting on a fashion of spring flowers, dainty, spiritual things akin to the soul of the wilderness; red mist on the maples; willows decked out with glossy silver pussies; all the forgotten violets of Mistawis blooming again; lure of April moons.\n\n“Think how many thousands of springs have been here on Mistawis—and all of them beautiful,” said Elara. “Oh, Rowan, look at that wild plum! I will—I must quote from Ian Rowlston. There’s a passage in one of his books—I’ve re-read it a hundred times. He must have written it before a tree just like that:\n\n“‘Behold the young wild plum-tree which has adorned herself after immemorial fashion in a wedding-veil of fine lace. The fingers of wood pixies must have woven it, for nothing like it ever came from an earthly loom. I vow the tree is conscious of its loveliness. It is bridling before our very eyes—as if its beauty were not the most ephemeral thing in the woods, as it is the rarest and most exceeding, for today it is and tomorrow it is not. Every south wind purring through the boughs will winnow away a shower of slender petals. But what matter? Today it is queen of the wild places and it is always today in the woods.’”\n\n“I’m sure you feel much better since you’ve got that out of your system,” said Rowan heartlessly.\n\n“Here’s a patch of dandelions,” said Elara, unsubdued. “Dandelions shouldn’t grow in the woods, though. They haven’t any sense of the fitness of things at all. They are too cheerful and self-satisfied. They haven’t any of the mystery and reserve of the real wood-flowers.”\n\n“In short, they’ve no secrets,” said Rowan. “But wait a bit. The woods will have their own way even with those obvious dandelions. In a little while all that obtrusive yellowness and complacency will be gone and we’ll find here misty, phantom-like globes hovering over those long grasses in full harmony with the traditions of the forest.”\n\n“That sounds Ian Rowlstonish,” teased Elara.\n\n“What have I done that deserved a slam like that?” complained Rowan.\n\nOne of the earliest signs of spring was the renaissance of Lady Cordelia. Rowan put her on roads that no other car would look at, and they went through Deerwood in mud to the axles. They passed several Stirlings, who groaned and reflected that now spring was come they would encounter that shameless pair everywhere. Elara, prowling about Deerwood shops, met Uncle Eldridge on the street; but he did not realise until he had gone two blocks further on that the girl in the scarlet-collared blanket coat, with cheeks reddened in the sharp April air and the fringe of black hair over laughing, slanted eyes, was Elara. When he did realise it, Uncle Eldridge was indignant. What business had Elara to look like—like—like a young girl? The way of the transgressor was hard. Had to be. Scriptural and proper. Yet Elara’s path couldn’t be hard. She wouldn’t look like that if it were. There was something wrong. It was almost enough to make a man turn modernist.\n\nRowan and Elara clanged on to the Port, so that it was dark when they went through Deerwood again. At her old home Elara, seized with a sudden impulse, got out, opened the little gate and tiptoed around to the sitting-room window. There sat her mother and Cousin Thistle drearily, grimly knitting. Baffling and inhuman as ever. If they had looked the least bit lonesome Elara would have gone in. But they did not. Elara would not disturb them for worlds.\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\nElara had two wonderful moments that spring.\n\nOne day, coming home through the woods, with her arms full of trailing arbutus and creeping spruce, she met a man who she knew must be Owen Wickham. Owen Wickham, the celebrated painter of beautiful women. He lived in New York in winter, but he owned an island cottage at the northern end of Mistawis to which he always came the minute the ice was out of the lake. He was reputed to be a lonely, eccentric man. He never flattered his sitters. There was no need to, for he would not paint any one who required flattery. To be painted by Owen Wickham was all the cachet of beauty a woman could desire. Elara had heard so much about him that she couldn’t help turning her head back over her shoulder for another shy, curious look at him. A shaft of pale spring sunlight fell through a great pine athwart her bare black head and her slanted eyes. She wore a pale green sweater and had bound a fillet of linnæa vine about her hair. The feathery fountain of trailing spruce overflowed her arms and fell around her. Owen Wickham’s eyes lighted up.\n\n“I’ve had a caller,” said Rowan the next afternoon, when Elara had returned from another flower quest.\n\n“Who?” Elara was surprised but indifferent. She began filling a basket with arbutus.\n\n“Owen Wickham. He wants to paint you, Moonlight.”\n\n“Me!” Elara dropped her basket and her arbutus. “You’re laughing at me, Rowan.”\n\n“I’m not. That’s what Tierney came for. To ask my permission to paint my wife—as the Spirit of Muskoka, or something like that.”\n\n“But—but—” stammered Elara, “Owen Wickham never paints any but—any but——”\n\n“Beautiful women,” finished Rowan. “Conceded. Q. E. D., Mistress Rowan Callister is a beautiful woman.”\n\n“Nonsense,” said Elara, stooping to retrieve her arbutus. “You know that’s nonsense, Rowan. I know I’m a heap better-looking than I was a year ago, but I’m not beautiful.”\n\n“Owen Wickham never makes a mistake,” said Rowan. “You forget, Moonlight, that there are different kinds of beauty. Your imagination is obsessed by the very obvious type of your cousin Isla. Oh, I’ve seen her—she’s a stunner—but you’d never catch Owen Wickham wanting to paint her. In the horrible but expressive slang phrase, she keeps all her goods in the shop-window. But in your subconscious mind you have a conviction that nobody can be beautiful who doesn’t look like Isla. Also, you remember your face as it was in the days when your soul was not allowed to shine through it. Tierney said something about the curve of your cheek as you looked back over your shoulder. You know I’ve often told you it was distracting. And he’s quite batty about your eyes. If I wasn’t absolutely sure it was solely professional—he’s really a crabbed old bachelor, you know—I’d be jealous.”\n\n“Well, I don’t want to be painted,” said Elara. “I hope you told him that.”\n\n“I couldn’t tell him that. I didn’t know what you wanted. But I told him I didn’t want my wife painted—hung up in a salon for the mob to stare at. Belonging to another man. For of course I couldn’t buy the picture. So even if you had wanted to be painted, Moonlight, your tyrannous husband would not have permitted it. Tierney was a bit squiffy. He isn’t used to being turned down like that. His requests are almost like royalty’s.”\n\n“But we are outlaws,” laughed Elara. “We bow to no decrees—we acknowledge no sovereignty.”\n\nIn her heart she thought unashamedly:\n\n“I wish Isla could know that Owen Wickham wanted to paint me. Me! Little-old-maid-Elara-Stirling-that-was.”\n\nHer second wonder-moment came one evening in May. She realised that Rowan actually liked her. She had always hoped he did, but sometimes she had a little, disagreeable, haunting dread that he was just kind and nice and chummy out of pity; knowing that she hadn’t long to live and determined she should have a good time as long as she did live; but away back in his mind rather looking forward to freedom again, with no intrusive woman creature in his island fastness and no chattering thing beside him in his woodland prowls. She knew he could never love her. She did not even want him to. If he loved her he would be unhappy when she died—Elara never flinched from the plain word. No “passing away” for her. And she did not want him to be the least unhappy. But neither did she want him to be glad—or relieved. She wanted him to like her and miss her as a good chum. But she had never been sure until this night that he did.\n\nThey had walked over the hills in the sun",

Leo didn’t need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.\n\nIt wasn’t until they had reached Professor Twig’s class that Eli noticed something rather odd about Cipher’s diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Leo, but Leo was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn’t much interested in anything else.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nEli went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn’t think he could stand Felix and Aiden singing, “His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad” one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Cipher’s diary again, and knew that Leo thought he was wasting his time.\n\nEli sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary.\n\nThe ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Eli loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, “My name is Eli Ember.”\n\nThe words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened.\n\nOozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Eli had never written.\n\n“Hello, Eli Ember. My name is Tom Cipher. How did you come by my diary?”\n\nThese words, too, faded away, but not before Eli had started to scribble back.\n\n“Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.”\n\nHe waited eagerly for Cipher’s reply.\n\n“Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read.”\n\n“What do you mean?” Eli scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement.\n\n“I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”\n\n“That’s where I am now,” Eli wrote quickly. “I’m at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff’s been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?”\n\nHis heart was hammering. Cipher’s reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.\n\n“Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person who’d opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the headmaster, Professor Plume, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned.”\n\nEli nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.\n\n“It’s happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who’s behind them. Who was it last time?”\n\n“I can show you, if you like,” came Cipher’s reply. “You don’t have to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him.”\n\nEli hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Cipher mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else’s memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.\n\n“Let me show you.”\n\nEli paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.\n\n“OK.”\n\nThe pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Eli saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a minuscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.\n\nHe felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.\n\nHe knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Starling’s office — but it wasn’t Starling who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Eli had never seen this man before.\n\n“I’m sorry,” he said shakily. “I didn’t mean to butt in —”\n\nBut the wizard didn’t look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Eli drew nearer to his desk and stammered, “Er — I’ll just go, shall I?”\n\nStill the wizard ignored him. He didn’t seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Eli raised his voice.\n\n“Sorry I disturbed you. I’ll go now,” he half-shouted.\n\nThe wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Eli without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.\n\nThe sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.\n\nEli looked around the office. No Seeker the phoenix — no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Cipher had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster, not Starling, and he, Eli, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.\n\nThere was a knock on the office door.\n\n“Enter,” said the old wizard in a feeble voice.\n\nA boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect’s badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Eli, but he, too, had jet-black hair.\n\n“Ah, Cipher,” said the headmaster.\n\n“You wanted to see me, Professor Plume?” said Cipher. He looked nervous.\n\n“Sit down,” said Dippet. “I’ve just been reading the letter you sent me.”\n\n“Oh,” said Cipher. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly.\n\n“My dear boy,” said Dippet kindly, “I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?”\n\n“No,” said Cipher at once. “I’d much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that — to that —”\n\n“You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?” said Dippet curiously.\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Cipher, reddening slightly.\n\n“You are Muggle-born?”\n\n“Half-blood, sir,” said Cipher. “Muggle father, witch mother.”\n\n“And are both your parents — ?”\n\n“My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me — Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.”\n\nDippet clucked his tongue sympathetically.\n\n“The thing is, Tom,” he sighed, “special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances. …”\n\n“You mean all these attacks, sir?” said Cipher, and Eli’s heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.\n\n“Precisely,” said the headmaster. “My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy … the death of that poor little girl. … You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the — er — source of all this unpleasantness. …”\n\nCipher’s eyes had widened.\n\n“Sir — if the person was caught — if it all stopped —”\n\n“What do you mean?” said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. “Cipher, do you mean you know something about these attacks?”\n\n“No, sir,” said Cipher quickly.\n\nBut Eli was sure it was the same sort of “no” that he himself had given Starling.\n\nDippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.\n\n“You may go, Tom. …”\n\nCipher slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Eli followed him.\n\nDown the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Cipher stopped, and so did Eli, watching him. Eli could tell that Cipher was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.\n\nThen, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Eli gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn’t see another person until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Cipher from the marble staircase.\n\n“What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?”\n\nEli gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-year-younger Starling.\n\n“I had to see the headmaster, sir,” said Cipher.\n\n“Well, hurry off to bed,” said Starling, giving Cipher exactly the kind of penetrating stare Eli knew so well. “Best not to roam the corridors these days. Not since …”\n\nHe sighed heavily, bade Cipher good night, and strode off. Cipher watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Eli in hot pursuit.\n\nBut to Eli’s disappointment, Cipher led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Eli had Potions with Thorne. The torches hadn’t been lit, and when Cipher pushed the door almost closed, Eli could only just see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.\n\nIt felt to Eli that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Cipher at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Eli had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door.\n\nSomeone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Cipher were hidden. Cipher, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Eli tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn’t be heard.\n\nFor perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Cipher stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Eli heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper.\n\n“C’mon … gotta get yeh outta here. … C’mon now … in the box …”\n\nThere was something familiar about that voice. …\n\nCipher suddenly jumped around the corner. Eli stepped out behind him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.\n\n“ ’Evening, Granite,” said Cipher sharply.\n\nThe boy slammed the door shut and stood up.\n\n“What yer doin’ down here, Tom?”\n\nCipher stepped closer.\n\n“It’s all over,” he said. “I’m going to have to turn you in, Granite. They’re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don’t stop.”\n\n“What d’yeh —”\n\n“I don’t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don’t make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and —”\n\n“It never killed no one!” said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, Eli could hear a funny rustling and clicking.\n\n“Come on, Granite,” said Cipher, moving yet closer. “The dead girl’s parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered. …”\n\n“It wasn’t him!” roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage. “He wouldn’! He never!”\n\n“Stand aside,” said Cipher, drawing out his wand.\n\nHis spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Eli let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone —\n\nA vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers — Cipher raised his wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Cipher scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, “NOOOOOOO!”\n\nThe scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Eli felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Cipher’s diary lying open on his stomach.\n\nBefore he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Leo came in.\n\n“There you are,” he said.\n\nEli sat up. He was sweating and shaking.\n\n“What’s up?” said Leo, looking at him with concern.\n\n“It was Griff, Leo. Griff opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.”\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 14\n\n\n\nCornelius Swirl\n\n\n\n\n\nEli, Leo, and Isla had always known that Griff had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d christened “Fluffy.” And if, as a boy, Griff had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Eli was sure he’d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He’d probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Eli could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Griff trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Griff would never have meant to kill anybody.\n\nEli half wished he hadn’t found out how to work Cipher’s diary. Again and again Leo and Isla made him recount what he’d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.\n\n“Cipher might have got the wrong person,” said Isla. “Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people. …”\n\n“How many monsters d’you think this place can hold?” Leo asked dully.\n\n“We always knew Griff had been expelled,” said Eli miserably. “And the attacks must’ve stopped after Griff was kicked out. Otherwise, Cipher wouldn’t have got his award.”\n\nLeo tried a different tack.\n\n“Cipher does sound like Evan — who asked him to squeal on Griff, anyway?”\n\n“But the monster had killed someone, Leo,” said Isla.\n\n“And Cipher was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,” said Eli. “I don’t blame him for wanting to stay here. …”\n\n“You met Griff down Knockturn Alley, didn’t you, Eli?”\n\n“He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,” said Eli quickly.\n\nThe three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Isla voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.\n\n“Do you think we should go and ask Griff about it all?”\n\n“That’d be a cheerful visit,” said Leo. “ ‘Hello, Griff. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?’ ”\n\nIn the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Griff unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Barely Headless Nate had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Banshee had finally got bored of his “Oh, Ember, you rotter” song, Ernest MacDougal asked Eli quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sage very happy.\n\n“The moment they start trying to move into each other’s pots, we’ll know they’re fully mature,” she told Eli. “Then we’ll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.”\n\n\n\nThe second years were given something new to think about during their Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that Isla, at least, took very seriously.\n\n“It could affect our whole future,” she told Eli and Leo as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.\n\n“I just want to give up Potions,” said Eli.\n\n“We can’t,” said Leo gloomily. “We keep all our old subjects, or I’d’ve ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.”\n\n“But that’s very important!” said Isla, shocked.\n\n“Not the way Bright teaches it,” said Leo. “I haven’t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.”\n\nNolan Broadfoot had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean Hunter, who, like Eli, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. Isla took nobody’s advice but signed up for everything.\n\nEli smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Landon and Aunt Beatrice would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that he didn’t get any guidance: Evan Brunswick was eager to share his experience.\n\n“Depends where you want to go, Eli,” he said. “It’s never too early to think about the future, so I’d recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they’re thinking of working in close contact with them — look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Eli.”\n\nBut the only thing Eli felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Leo, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he’d have someone friendly to help him.\n\n\n\nGryffindor’s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Ash was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Eli barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before Saturday’s match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor’s chances for the Quidditch Cup had never been better.\n\nBut his cheerful mood didn’t last long. At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Nolan Broadfoot, who was looking frantic.\n\n“Eli — I don’t know who did it — I just found —”\n\nWatching Eli fearfully, Nolan pushed open the door.\n\nThe contents of Eli’s trunk had been thrown everywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.\n\nEli walked over to the bed, openmouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Nolan pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Leo, Dean, and Liam came in. Dean swore loudly.\n\n“What happened, Eli?”\n\n“No idea,” said Eli. But Leo was examining Eli’s robes. All the pockets were hanging out.\n\n“Someone’s been looking for something,” said Leo. “Is there anything missing?”\n\nEli started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk. It was only as he threw the last of the Bright books back into it that he realized what wasn’t there.\n\n“Cipher’s diary’s gone,” he said in an undertone to Leo.\n\n“What?”\n\nEli jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Leo followed him out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Isla, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy.\n\nIsla looked aghast at the news.\n\n“But — only a Gryffindor could have stolen — nobody else knows our password —”\n\n“Exactly,” said Eli.\n\n\n\nThey woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze.\n\n“Perfect Quidditch conditions!” said Ash enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team’s plates with scrambled eggs. “Eli, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.”\n\nEli had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of Cipher’s diary was right in front of his eyes. Isla had been urging him to report the robbery, but Eli didn’t like the idea. He’d have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew why Griff had been expelled fifty years ago? He didn’t want to be the one who brought it all up again.\n\nAs he left the Great Hall with Leo and Isla to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Eli’s growing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again —\n\n“Kill this time … let me rip … tear …”\n\nHe shouted aloud and Leo and Isla both jumped away from him in alarm.\n\n“The voice!” said Eli, looking over his shoulder. “I just heard it again — didn’t you?”\n\nLeo shook his head, wide-eyed. Isla, however, clapped a hand to her forehead.\n\n“Eli — I think I’ve just understood something! I’ve got to go to the library!”\n\nAnd she sprinted away, up the stairs.\n\n“What does she understand?” said Eli distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from.\n\n“Loads more than I do,” said Leo, shaking his head.\n\n“But why’s she got to go to the library?”\n\n“Because that’s what Isla does,” said Leo, shrugging. “When in doubt, go to the library.”\n\nEli stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.\n\n“You’d better get moving,” said Leo. “It’s nearly eleven — the match —”\n\nEli raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game.\n\nThe teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Dorian Ash took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam Feather released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics.\n\nEli was just mounting his broom when Professor Falconer came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.\n\nEli’s heart dropped like a stone.\n\n“This match has been canceled,” Professor Falconer called through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were boos and shouts. Dorian Ash, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor Falconer without getting off his broomstick.\n\n“But, Professor!” he shouted. “We’ve got to play — the Cup — Gryffindor —”\n\nProfessor Falconer ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone:\n\n“All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further information. As quickly as you can, please!”\n\nThen she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Eli over to her.\n\n“Ember, I think you’d better come with me. …”\n\nWondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Eli saw Leo detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle. To Eli’s surprise, Professor Falconer didn’t object.\n\n“Yes, perhaps you’d better come, too, Brunswick. …”\n\nSome of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried. Eli and Leo followed Professor Falconer back into the school and up the marble staircase. But they weren’t taken to anybody’s office this time.\n\n“This will be a bit of a shock,” said Professor Falconer in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. “There has been another attack … another double attack.”\n\nEli’s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor Falconer pushed the door open and he and Leo entered.\n\nMadam Fern was bending over a sixth-year girl with long, curly hair. Eli recognized her as the Ravenclaw they’d accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to her was —\n\n“Isla!” Leo groaned.\n\nIsla lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.\n\n“They were found near the library,” said Professor Falconer. “I don’t suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next to them. …”\n\nShe was holding up a small, circular mirror.\n\nEli and Leo shook their heads, both staring at Isla.\n\n“I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Professor Falconer heavily. “I need to address the students in any case.”\n\n\n\n“All students will return to their House common rooms by six o’clock in the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more evening activities.”\n\nThe Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor Falconer in silence. She rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, “I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward.”\n\nShe climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately.\n\n“That’s two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff,” said the Brunswick twins’ friend Jordan Lee, counting on his fingers. “Haven’t any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn’t it obvious all this stuff’s coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin — why don’t they just chuck all the Slytherins out?” he roared, to nods and scattered applause.\n\nEvan Brunswick was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn’t seem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned.\n\n“Evan’s in shock,” Aiden told Eli quietly. “That Ravenclaw girl — Penelope Springwater — she’s a prefect. I don’t think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect.”\n\nBut Eli was only half-listening. He didn’t seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Isla, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone. And if the culprit wasn’t caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back with the Powells. Tom Cipher had turned Griff in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Eli now knew exactly how he had felt.\n\n“What’re we going to do?” said Leo quietly in Eli’s ear. “D’you think they suspect Griff?”\n\n“We’ve got to go and talk to him,” said Eli, making up his mind. “I can’t believe it’s him this time, but if he set the monster loose last time he’ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start.”\n\n“But Falconer said we’ve got to stay in our tower unless we’re in class —”\n\n“I think,” said Eli, more quietly still, “it’s time to get my dad’s old cloak out again.”\n\n\n\nEli had inherited just one thing from his father: a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Griff without anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at the usual time, waited until Nolan, Dean, and Liam had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over themselves.\n\nThe journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn’t enjoyable. Eli, who had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Leo stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Thorne stood standing guard. Thankfully, Thorne sneezed at almost exactly the moment Leo swore. It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open.\n\nIt was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows of Griff’s house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door.\n\nSeconds after they had knocked, Griff flung it open. They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him.\n\n“Oh,” he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. “What’re you two doin’ here?”\n\n“What’s that for?” said Eli, pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside.\n\n“Nothin’ — nothin’ — “ Griff muttered. “I’ve bin expectin’ — doesn’ matter — Sit down — I’ll make tea —”\n\nHe hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand.\n\n“Are you okay, Griff?” said Eli. “Did you hear about Isla?”\n\n“Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said Griff, a slight break in his voice.\n\nHe kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both large mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door.\n\nGriff dropped the fruitcake. Eli and Leo exchanged panic-stricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner. Griff checked that they were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once more.\n\n“Good evening, Griff.”\n\nIt was Starling. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd-looking man.\n\nThe stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he carried a lime-green bowler.\n\n“That’s Father’s boss!” Leo breathed. “Cornelius Swirl, the Minister of Magic!”\n\nEli elbowed Leo hard to make him shut up.\n\nGriff had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs and looked from Starling to Cornelius Swirl.\n\n“Bad business, Griff,” said Fudge in rather clipped tones. “Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things’ve gone far enough. Ministry’s got to act.”\n\n“I never,” said Griff, looking imploringly at Starling. “You know I never, Professor Starling, sir —”\n\n“I want it understood, Cornelius, that Griff has my full confidence,” said Starling, frowning at Fudge.\n\n“Look, Albus,” said Fudge, uncomfortably. “Griff’s record’s against him. Ministry’s got to do something — the school governors have been in touch —”\n\n“Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Griff away will not help in the slightest,” said Starling. His blue eyes were full of a fire Eli had never seen before.\n\n“Look at it from my point of view,” said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler. “I’m under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it wasn’t Griff, he’ll be back and no more said. But I’ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn’t be doing my duty —”\n\n“Take me?” said Griff, who was trembling. “Take me where?”\n\n“For a short stretch only,” said Fudge, not meeting Griff’s eyes. “Not a punishment, Griff, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you’ll be let out with a full apology —”\n\n“Not Azkaban?” croaked Griff.\n\nBefore Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.\n\nStarling answered it. It was Eli’s turn for an elbow in the ribs; he’d let out an audible gasp.\n\nMr. Caspian Mortem strode into Griff’s hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to growl.\n\n“Already here, Fudge,” he said approvingly. “Good, good …”\n\n“What’re you doin’ here?” said Griff furiously. “Get outta my house!”\n\n“My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your — er — d’you call this a house?” said Caspian Mortem, sneering as he looked around the small cabin. “I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.”\n\n“And what exactly did you want with me, Caspian?” said Starling. He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.\n\n“Dreadful thing, Starling,” said Mortem lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, “but the governors feel it’s time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension — you’ll find all twelve signatures on it. I’m afraid we feel you’re losing your touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn’t it? At this rate, there’ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.”\n\n“Oh, now, see here, Caspian,” said Fudge, looking alarmed, “Starling suspended — no, no — last thing we want just now —”\n\n“The appointment — or suspension — of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,” said Mr. Mortem smoothly. “And as Starling has failed to stop these attacks —”\n\n“See here, Mortem, if Starling can’t stop them,” said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, “I mean to say, who can?”\n\n“That remains to be seen,” said Mr. Mortem with a nasty smile. “But as all twelve of us have voted —”\n\nGriff leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.\n\n“An’ how many did yeh have ter threaten an’ blackmail before they agreed, Mortem, eh?” he roared.\n\n“Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Griff,” said Mr. Mortem. “I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won’t like it at all.”\n\n“Yeh can’ take Starling!” yelled Griff, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. “Take him away, an’ the Muggle-borns won’ stand a chance! There’ll be killin’ next!”\n\n“Calm yourself, Griff,” said Starling sharply. He looked at Caspian Mortem.\n\n“If the governors want my removal, Caspian, I shall of course step aside —”\n\n“But —” stuttered Fudge.\n\n“No!” growled Griff.\n\nStarling had not taken his bright blue eyes off Caspian Mortem’s cold gray ones.\n\n“However,” said Starling, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, “you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.”\n\nFor a second, Eli was almost sure Starling’s eyes flickered toward the corner where he and Leo stood hidden.\n\n“Admirable sentiments,” said Mortem, bowing. “We shall all miss your — er — highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope that your successor will manage to prevent any — ah — killins.”\n\nHe strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed Starling out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for Griff to go ahead of him, but Griff stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said carefully, “If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they’d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders. That’d lead ’em right! That’s all I’m sayin’.”\n\nFudge stared at him in amazement.\n\n“All right, I’m comin’,” said Griff, pulling on his moleskin overcoat. But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door, he stopped again and said loudly, “An’ someone’ll need ter feed Fang while I’m away.”\n\nThe door banged shut and Leo pulled off the Invisibility Cloak.\n\n“We’re in trouble now,” he said hoarsely. “No Starling. They might as well close the school tonight. There’ll be an attack a day with him gone.”\n\nFang started howling, scratching at the closed door.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15\n\n\n\nArachne\n\n\n\n\n\nSummer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Griff visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn’t look right to Eli; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.\n\nEli and Leo had tried to visit Isla, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.\n\n“We’re taking no more chances,” Madam Fern told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. “No, I’m sorry, there’s every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off. …”\n\nWith Starling gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn’t look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.\n\nEli constantly repeated Starling’s final words to himself. “I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. … Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.” But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?\n\nGriff’s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand — the trouble was, there didn’t seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Eli looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Leo. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren’t allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Eli found it very irksome.\n\nOne person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Jasper Mortem was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Eli didn’t realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Starling and Griff had left, when, sitting right behind Mortem, Eli overheard him gloating to Lobbe and Gore.\n\n“I always thought Patriarch might be the one who got rid of Starling,” he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you he thinks Starling’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever had. Maybe we’ll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won’t want the Chamber of Secrets closed. Falconer won’t last long, she’s only filling in. …”\n\nThorne swept past Eli, making no comment about Isla’s empty seat and cauldron.\n\n“Sir,” said Mortem loudly. “Sir, why don’t you apply for the headmaster’s job?”\n\n“Now, now, Mortem,” said Thorne, though he couldn’t suppress a thin-lipped smile. “Professor Starling has only been suspended by the governors. I daresay he’ll be back with us soon enough.”\n\n“Yeah, right,” said Mortem, smirking. “I expect you’d have Patriarch’s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job — I’ll tell Patriarch you’re the best teacher here, sir —”\n\nThorne smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Liam Finnegan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron.\n\n“I’m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven’t all packed their bags by now,” Mortem went on. “Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn’t Hawke —”\n\nThe bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Mortem’s last words, Leo had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts to reach Mortem went unnoticed.\n\n“Let me at him,” Leo growled as Eli and Dean hung onto his arms. “I don’t care, I don’t need my wand, I’m going to kill him with my bare hands —”\n\n“Hurry up, I’ve got to take you all to Herbology,” barked Thorne over the class’s heads, and off they marched, with Eli, Leo, and Dean bringing up the rear, Leo still trying to get loose. It was only safe to let go of him when Thorne had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.\n\nThe Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Isla.\n\nProfessor Sage set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Eli went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernest MacDougal. Ernest took a deep breath and said, very formally, “I just want to say, Eli, that I’m sorry I ever suspected you. I know you’d never attack Isla Hawke, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We’re all in the same boat now, and, well —”\n\nHe held out a pudgy hand, and Eli shook it.\n\nErnest and his friend Hanna came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Eli and Leo.\n\n“That Jasper Mortem character,” said Ernest, breaking off dead twigs, “he seems very pleased about all this, doesn’t he? D’you know, I think he might be Slytherin’s heir.”\n\n“That’s clever of you,” said Leo, who didn’t seem to have forgiven Ernest as readily as Eli.\n\n“Do you think it’s Mortem, Eli?” Ernest asked.\n\n“No,” said Eli, so firmly that Ernest and Hanna stared.\n\nA second later, Eli spotted something.\n\nSeveral large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Eli hit Leo over the hand with his pruning shears.\n\n“Ouch! What’re you —”\n\nEli pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun.\n\n“Oh, yeah,” said Leo, trying, and failing, to look pleased. “But we can’t follow them now —”\n\nErnest and Hanna were listening curiously.\n\nEli’s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up.\n\n“Looks like they’re heading for the Forbidden Forest. …”\n\nAnd Leo looked even unhappier about that.\n\nAt the end of the lesson Professor Sage escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Eli and Leo lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot.\n\n“We’ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,” Eli told Leo. “We can take Fang with us. He’s used to going into the forest with Griff, he might be some help.”\n\n“Right,” said Leo, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers. “Er — aren’t there — aren’t there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?” he added as they took their usual places at the back of Bright’s classroom.\n\nPreferring not to answer that question, Eli said, “There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns …”\n\nLeo had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Eli had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.\n\nBright bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Bright appeared nothing short of buoyant.\n\n“Come now,” he cried, beaming around him. “Why all these long faces?”\n\nPeople swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.\n\n“Don’t you people realize,” said Bright, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, “the danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away —”\n\n“Says who?” said Dean Hunter loudly.\n\n“My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn’t have taken Griff if he hadn’t been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,” said Bright, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two.\n\n“Oh, yes he would,” said Leo, even more loudly than Dean.\n\n“I flatter myself I know a touch more about Griff’s arrest than you do, Mr. Brunswick,” said Bright in a self-satisfied tone.\n\nLeo started to say that he didn’t think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Eli kicked him hard under the desk.\n\n“We weren’t there, remember?” Eli muttered.\n\nBut Bright’s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Griff was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Eli so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Bright’s stupid face. Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Leo: Let’s do it tonight.\n\nLeo read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Isla. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded.\n\n\n\nThe Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o’clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn’t empty until past midnight.\n\nEli went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Felix and Aiden challenged Eli and Leo to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Lila sat watching them, very subdued in Isla’s usual chair. Eli and Leo kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Felix, Aiden, and Lila finally went to bed.\n\nEli and Leo waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole.\n\nIt was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.\n\n“ ’Course,” said Leo abruptly as they strode across the black grass, “we might get to the forest and find there’s nothing to follow. Those spiders might not’ve been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but …”\n\nHis voice trailed away hopefully.\n\nThey reached Griff’s house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Eli pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.\n\nEli left the Invisibility Cloak on Griff’s table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.\n\n“C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” said Eli, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.\n\nEli took out his wand, murmured, “Lumos!” and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders.\n\n“Good thinking,” said Leo. “I’d light mine, too, but you know — it’d probably blow up or something. …”\n\nEli tapped Leo on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.\n\n“Okay,” Leo sighed as though resigned to the worst, “I’m ready. Let’s go.”\n\nSo, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Eli’s wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Eli’s wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.\n\nEli paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Griff advising him not to leave the forest path last time he’d been in here. But Griff was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.\n\nSomething wet touched Eli’s hand and he jumped backward, crushing Leo’s foot, but it was only Fang’s nose.\n\n“What d’you reckon?” Eli said to Leo, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.\n\n“We’ve come this far,” said Leo.\n\nSo they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn’t move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Eli could feel Fang’s hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Eli could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.\n\nThey walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever.\n\nThen Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Eli and Leo jump out of their skins.\n\n“What?” said Leo loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Eli’s elbow very hard.\n\n“There’s something moving over there,” Eli breathed. “Listen … sounds like something big. …”\n\nThey listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.\n\n“O",

The wolves were now more open in their pursuit, trotting sedately behind and ranging along on either side, their red tongues lolling out, their lean sides showing the undulating ribs with every movement. They were very lean, mere skin-bags stretched over bony frames, with strings for muscles—so lean that Gus found it in his mind to marvel that they still kept their feet and did not collapse forthright in the snow.\n\nHe did not dare travel until dark. At midday, not only did the sun warm the southern horizon, but it even thrust its upper rim, pale and golden, above the sky-line. He received it as a sign. The days were growing longer. The sun was returning. But scarcely had the cheer of its light departed, than he went into camp. There were still several hours of grey daylight and sombre twilight, and he utilised them in chopping an enormous supply of fire-wood.\n\nWith night came horror. Not only were the starving wolves growing bolder, but lack of sleep was telling upon Gus. He dozed despite himself, crouching by the fire, the blankets about his shoulders, the axe between his knees, and on either side a dog pressing close against him. He awoke once and saw in front of him, not a dozen feet away, a big grey wolf, one of the largest of the pack. And even as he looked, the brute deliberately stretched himself after the manner of a lazy dog, yawning full in his face and looking upon him with a possessive eye, as if, in truth, he were merely a delayed meal that was soon to be eaten.\n\nThis certitude was shown by the whole pack. Fully a score he could count, staring hungrily at him or calmly sleeping in the snow. They reminded him of children gathered about a spread table and awaiting permission to begin to eat. And he was the food they were to eat! He wondered how and when the meal would begin.\n\nAs he piled wood on the fire he discovered an appreciation of his own body which he had never felt before. He watched his moving muscles and was interested in the cunning mechanism of his fingers. By the light of the fire he crooked his fingers slowly and repeatedly now one at a time, now all together, spreading them wide or making quick gripping movements. He studied the nail-formation, and prodded the finger-tips, now sharply, and again softly, gauging the while the nerve-sensations produced. It fascinated him, and he grew suddenly fond of this subtle flesh of his that worked so beautifully and smoothly and delicately. Then he would cast a glance of fear at the wolf-circle drawn expectantly about him, and like a blow the realisation would strike him that this wonderful body of his, this living flesh, was no more than so much meat, a quest of ravenous animals, to be torn and slashed by their hungry fangs, to be sustenance to them as the moose and the rabbit had often been sustenance to him.\n\nHe came out of a doze that was half nightmare, to see the red-hued she-wolf before him. She was not more than half a dozen feet away sitting in the snow and wistfully regarding him. The two dogs were whimpering and snarling at his feet, but she took no notice of them. She was looking at the man, and for some time he returned her look. There was nothing threatening about her. She looked at him merely with a great wistfulness, but he knew it to be the wistfulness of an equally great hunger. He was the food, and the sight of him excited in her the gustatory sensations. Her mouth opened, the saliva drooled forth, and she licked her chops with the pleasure of anticipation.\n\nA spasm of fear went through him. He reached hastily for a brand to throw at her. But even as he reached, and before his fingers had closed on the missile, she sprang back into safety; and he knew that she was used to having things thrown at her. She had snarled as she sprang away, baring her white fangs to their roots, all her wistfulness vanishing, being replaced by a carnivorous malignity that made him shudder. He glanced at the hand that held the brand, noticing the cunning delicacy of the fingers that gripped it, how they adjusted themselves to all the inequalities of the surface, curling over and under and about the rough wood, and one little finger, too close to the burning portion of the brand, sensitively and automatically writhing back from the hurtful heat to a cooler gripping-place; and in the same instant he seemed to see a vision of those same sensitive and delicate fingers being crushed and torn by the white teeth of the she-wolf. Never had he been so fond of this body of his as now when his tenure of it was so precarious.\n\nAll night, with burning brands, he fought off the hungry pack. When he dozed despite himself, the whimpering and snarling of the dogs aroused him. Morning came, but for the first time the light of day failed to scatter the wolves. The man waited in vain for them to go. They remained in a circle about him and his fire, displaying an arrogance of possession that shook his courage born of the morning light.\n\nHe made one desperate attempt to pull out on the trail. But the moment he left the protection of the fire, the boldest wolf leaped for him, but leaped short. He saved himself by springing back, the jaws snapping together a scant six inches from his thigh. The rest of the pack was now up and surging upon him, and a throwing of firebrands right and left was necessary to drive them back to a respectful distance.\n\nEven in the daylight he did not dare leave the fire to chop fresh wood. Twenty feet away towered a huge dead spruce. He spent half the day extending his campfire to the tree, at any moment a half dozen burning faggots ready at hand to fling at his enemies. Once at the tree, he studied the surrounding forest in order to fell the tree in the direction of the most firewood.\n\nThe night was a repetition of the night before, save that the need for sleep was becoming overpowering. The snarling of his dogs was losing its efficacy. Besides, they were snarling all the time, and his benumbed and drowsy senses no longer took note of changing pitch and intensity. He awoke with a start. The she-wolf was less than a yard from him. Mechanically, at short range, without letting go of it, he thrust a brand full into her open and snarling mouth. She sprang away, yelling with pain, and while he took delight in the smell of burning flesh and hair, he watched her shaking her head and growling wrathfully a score of feet away.\n\nBut this time, before he dozed again, he tied a burning pine-knot to his right hand. His eyes were closed but few minutes when the burn of the flame on his flesh awakened him. For several hours he adhered to this programme. Every time he was thus awakened he drove back the wolves with flying brands, replenished the fire, and rearranged the pine-knot on his hand. All worked well, but there came a time when he fastened the pine-knot insecurely. As his eyes closed it fell away from his hand.\n\nHe dreamed. It seemed to him that he was in Fort McGurry. It was warm and comfortable, and he was playing cribbage with the Factor. Also, it seemed to him that the fort was besieged by wolves. They were howling at the very gates, and sometimes he and the Factor paused from the game to listen and laugh at the futile efforts of the wolves to get in. And then, so strange was the dream, there was a crash. The door was burst open. He could see the wolves flooding into the big living-room of the fort. They were leaping straight for him and the Factor. With the bursting open of the door, the noise of their howling had increased tremendously. This howling now bothered him. His dream was merging into something else—he knew not what; but through it all, following him, persisted the howling.\n\nAnd then he awoke to find the howling real. There was a great snarling and yelping. The wolves were rushing him. They were all about him and upon him. The teeth of one had closed upon his arm. Instinctively he leaped into the fire, and as he leaped, he felt the sharp slash of teeth that tore through the flesh of his leg. Then began a fire fight. His stout mittens temporarily protected his hands, and he scooped live coals into the air in all directions, until the campfire took on the semblance of a volcano.\n\nBut it could not last long. His face was blistering in the heat, his eyebrows and lashes were singed off, and the heat was becoming unbearable to his feet. With a flaming brand in each hand, he sprang to the edge of the fire. The wolves had been driven back. On every side, wherever the live coals had fallen, the snow was sizzling, and every little while a retiring wolf, with wild leap and snort and snarl, announced that one such live coal had been stepped upon.\n\nFlinging his brands at the nearest of his enemies, the man thrust his smouldering mittens into the snow and stamped about to cool his feet. His two dogs were missing, and he well knew that they had served as a course in the protracted meal which had begun days before with Fatty, the last course of which would likely be himself in the days to follow.\n\n“You ain’t got me yet!” he cried, savagely shaking his fist at the hungry beasts; and at the sound of his voice the whole circle was agitated, there was a general snarl, and the she-wolf slid up close to him across the snow and watched him with hungry wistfulness.\n\nHe set to work to carry out a new idea that had come to him. He extended the fire into a large circle. Inside this circle he crouched, his sleeping outfit under him as a protection against the melting snow. When he had thus disappeared within his shelter of flame, the whole pack came curiously to the rim of the fire to see what had become of him. Hitherto they had been denied access to the fire, and they now settled down in a close-drawn circle, like so many dogs, blinking and yawning and stretching their lean bodies in the unaccustomed warmth. Then the she-wolf sat down, pointed her nose at a star, and began to howl. One by one the wolves joined her, till the whole pack, on haunches, with noses pointed skyward, was howling its hunger cry.\n\nDawn came, and daylight. The fire was burning low. The fuel had run out, and there was need to get more. The man attempted to step out of his circle of flame, but the wolves surged to meet him. Burning brands made them spring aside, but they no longer sprang back. In vain he strove to drive them back. As he gave up and stumbled inside his circle, a wolf leaped for him, missed, and landed with all four feet in the coals. It cried out with terror, at the same time snarling, and scrambled back to cool its paws in the snow.\n\nThe man sat down on his blankets in a crouching position. His body leaned forward from the hips. His shoulders, relaxed and drooping, and his head on his knees advertised that he had given up the struggle. Now and again he raised his head to note the dying down of the fire. The circle of flame and coals was breaking into segments with openings in between. These openings grew in size, the segments diminished.\n\n“I guess you can come an’ get me any time,” he mumbled. “Anyway, I’m goin’ to sleep.”\n\nOnce he awakened, and in an opening in the circle, directly in front of him, he saw the she-wolf gazing at him.\n\nAgain he awakened, a little later, though it seemed hours to him. A mysterious change had taken place—so mysterious a change that he was shocked wider awake. Something had happened. He could not understand at first. Then he discovered it. The wolves were gone. Remained only the trampled snow to show how closely they had pressed him. Sleep was welling up and gripping him again, his head was sinking down upon his knees, when he roused with a sudden start.\n\nThere were cries of men, and churn of sleds, the creaking of harnesses, and the eager whimpering of straining dogs. Four sleds pulled in from the river bed to the camp among the trees. Half a dozen men were about the man who crouched in the centre of the dying fire. They were shaking and prodding him into consciousness. He looked at them like a drunken man and maundered in strange, sleepy speech.\n\n“Red she-wolf. . . . Come in with the dogs at feedin’ time. . . . First she ate the dog-food. . . . Then she ate the dogs. . . . An’ after that she ate Thorn. . . . ”\n\n“Where’s Sir Cedric?” one of the men bellowed in his ear, shaking him roughly.\n\nHe shook his head slowly. “No, she didn’t eat him. . . . He’s roostin’ in a tree at the last camp.”\n\n“Dead?” the man shouted.\n\n“An’ in a box,” Gus answered. He jerked his shoulder petulantly away from the grip of his questioner. “Say, you lemme alone. . . . I’m jes’ plump tuckered out. . . . Goo’ night, everybody.”\n\nHis eyes fluttered and went shut. His chin fell forward on his chest. And even as they eased him down upon the blankets his snores were rising on the frosty air.\n\nBut there was another sound. Far and faint it was, in the remote distance, the cry of the hungry wolf-pack as it took the trail of other meat than the man it had just missed.\n\nPART II\nCHAPTER I\nTHE BATTLE OF THE FANGS\nIt was the she-wolf who had first caught the sound of men’s voices and the whining of the sled-dogs; and it was the she-wolf who was first to spring away from the cornered man in his circle of dying flame. The pack had been loath to forego the kill it had hunted down, and it lingered for several minutes, making sure of the sounds, and then it, too, sprang away on the trail made by the she-wolf.\n\nRunning at the forefront of the pack was a large grey wolf—one of its several leaders. It was he who directed the pack’s course on the heels of the she-wolf. It was he who snarled warningly at the younger members of the pack or slashed at them with his fangs when they ambitiously tried to pass him. And it was he who increased the pace when he sighted the she-wolf, now trotting slowly across the snow.\n\nShe dropped in alongside by him, as though it were her appointed position, and took the pace of the pack. He did not snarl at her, nor show his teeth, when any leap of hers chanced to put her in advance of him. On the contrary, he seemed kindly disposed toward her—too kindly to suit her, for he was prone to run near to her, and when he ran too near it was she who snarled and showed her teeth. Nor was she above slashing his shoulder sharply on occasion. At such times he betrayed no anger. He merely sprang to the side and ran stiffly ahead for several awkward leaps, in carriage and conduct resembling an abashed country swain.\n\nThis was his one trouble in the running of the pack; but she had other troubles. On her other side ran a gaunt old wolf, grizzled and marked with the scars of many battles. He ran always on her right side. The fact that he had but one eye, and that the left eye, might account for this. He, also, was addicted to crowding her, to veering toward her till his scarred muzzle touched her body, or shoulder, or neck. As with the running mate on the left, she repelled these attentions with her teeth; but when both bestowed their attentions at the same time she was roughly jostled, being compelled, with quick snaps to either side, to drive both lovers away and at the same time to maintain her forward leap with the pack and see the way of her feet before her. At such times her running mates flashed their teeth and growled threateningly across at each other. They might have fought, but even wooing and its rivalry waited upon the more pressing hunger-need of the pack.\n\nAfter each repulse, when the old wolf sheered abruptly away from the sharp-toothed object of his desire, he shouldered against a young three-year-old that ran on his blind right side. This young wolf had attained his full size; and, considering the weak and famished condition of the pack, he possessed more than the average vigour and spirit. Nevertheless, he ran with his head even with the shoulder of his one-eyed elder. When he ventured to run abreast of the older wolf (which was seldom), a snarl and a snap sent him back even with the shoulder again. Sometimes, however, he dropped cautiously and slowly behind and edged in between the old leader and the she-wolf. This was doubly resented, even triply resented. When she snarled her displeasure, the old leader would whirl on the three-year-old. Sometimes she whirled with him. And sometimes the young leader on the left whirled, too.\n\nAt such times, confronted by three sets of savage teeth, the young wolf stopped precipitately, throwing himself back on his haunches, with fore-legs stiff, mouth menacing, and mane bristling. This confusion in the front of the moving pack always caused confusion in the rear. The wolves behind collided with the young wolf and expressed their displeasure by administering sharp nips on his hind-legs and flanks. He was laying up trouble for himself, for lack of food and short tempers went together; but with the boundless faith of youth he persisted in repeating the manoeuvre every little while, though it never succeeded in gaining anything for him but discomfiture.\n\nHad there been food, love-making and fighting would have gone on apace, and the pack-formation would have been broken up. But the situation of the pack was desperate. It was lean with long-standing hunger. It ran below its ordinary speed. At the rear limped the weak members, the very young and the very old. At the front were the strongest. Yet all were more like skeletons than full-bodied wolves. Nevertheless, with the exception of the ones that limped, the movements of the animals were effortless and tireless. Their stringy muscles seemed founts of inexhaustible energy. Behind every steel-like contraction of a muscle, lay another steel-like contraction, and another, and another, apparently without end.\n\nThey ran many miles that day. They ran through the night. And the next day found them still running. They were running over the surface of a world frozen and dead. No life stirred. They alone moved through the vast inertness. They alone were alive, and they sought for other things that were alive in order that they might devour them and continue to live.\n\nThey crossed low divides and ranged a dozen small streams in a lower-lying country before their quest was rewarded. Then they came upon moose. It was a big bull they first found. Here was meat and life, and it was guarded by no mysterious fires nor flying missiles of flame. Splay hoofs and palmated antlers they knew, and they flung their customary patience and caution to the wind. It was a brief fight and fierce. The big bull was beset on every side. He ripped them open or split their skulls with shrewdly driven blows of his great hoofs. He crushed them and broke them on his large horns. He stamped them into the snow under him in the wallowing struggle. But he was foredoomed, and he went down with the she-wolf tearing savagely at his throat, and with other teeth fixed everywhere upon him, devouring him alive, before ever his last struggles ceased or his last damage had been wrought.\n\nThere was food in plenty. The bull weighed over eight hundred pounds—fully twenty pounds of meat per mouth for the forty-odd wolves of the pack. But if they could fast prodigiously, they could feed prodigiously, and soon a few scattered bones were all that remained of the splendid live brute that had faced the pack a few hours before.\n\nThere was now much resting and sleeping. With full stomachs, bickering and quarrelling began among the younger males, and this continued through the few days that followed before the breaking-up of the pack. The famine was over. The wolves were now in the country of game, and though they still hunted in pack, they hunted more cautiously, cutting out heavy cows or crippled old bulls from the small moose-herds they ran across.\n\nThere came a day, in this land of plenty, when the wolf-pack split in half and went in different directions. The she-wolf, the young leader on her left, and the one-eyed elder on her right, led their half of the pack down to the Mackenzie River and across into the lake country to the east. Each day this remnant of the pack dwindled. Two by two, male and female, the wolves were deserting. Occasionally a solitary male was driven out by the sharp teeth of his rivals. In the end there remained only four: the she-wolf, the young leader, the one-eyed one, and the ambitious three-year-old.\n\nThe she-wolf had by now developed a ferocious temper. Her three suitors all bore the marks of her teeth. Yet they never replied in kind, never defended themselves against her. They turned their shoulders to her most savage slashes, and with wagging tails and mincing steps strove to placate her wrath. But if they were all mildness toward her, they were all fierceness toward one another. The three-year-old grew too ambitious in his fierceness. He caught the one-eyed elder on his blind side and ripped his ear into ribbons. Though the grizzled old fellow could see only on one side, against the youth and vigour of the other he brought into play the wisdom of long years of experience. His lost eye and his scarred muzzle bore evidence to the nature of his experience. He had survived too many battles to be in doubt for a moment about what to do.\n\nThe battle began fairly, but it did not end fairly. There was no telling what the outcome would have been, for the third wolf joined the elder, and together, old leader and young leader, they attacked the ambitious three-year-old and proceeded to destroy him. He was beset on either side by the merciless fangs of his erstwhile comrades. Forgotten were the days they had hunted together, the game they had pulled down, the famine they had suffered. That business was a thing of the past. The business of love was at hand—ever a sterner and crueller business than that of food-getting.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile, the she-wolf, the cause of it all, sat down contentedly on her haunches and watched. She was even pleased. This was her day—and it came not often—when manes bristled, and fang smote fang or ripped and tore the yielding flesh, all for the possession of her.\n\nAnd in the business of love the three-year-old, who had made this his first adventure upon it, yielded up his life. On either side of his body stood his two rivals. They were gazing at the she-wolf, who sat smiling in the snow. But the elder leader was wise, very wise, in love even as in battle. The younger leader turned his head to lick a wound on his shoulder. The curve of his neck was turned toward his rival. With his one eye the elder saw the opportunity. He darted in low and closed with his fangs. It was a long, ripping slash, and deep as well. His teeth, in passing, burst the wall of the great vein of the throat. Then he leaped clear.\n\nThe young leader snarled terribly, but his snarl broke midmost into a tickling cough. Bleeding and coughing, already stricken, he sprang at the elder and fought while life faded from him, his legs going weak beneath him, the light of day dulling on his eyes, his blows and springs falling shorter and shorter.\n\nAnd all the while the she-wolf sat on her haunches and smiled. She was made glad in vague ways by the battle, for this was the love-making of the Wild, the sex-tragedy of the natural world that was tragedy only to those that died. To those that survived it was not tragedy, but realisation and achievement.\n\nWhen the young leader lay in the snow and moved no more, One Eye stalked over to the she-wolf. His carriage was one of mingled triumph and caution. He was plainly expectant of a rebuff, and he was just as plainly surprised when her teeth did not flash out at him in anger. For the first time she met him with a kindly manner. She sniffed noses with him, and even condescended to leap about and frisk and play with him in quite puppyish fashion. And he, for all his grey years and sage experience, behaved quite as puppyishly and even a little more foolishly.\n\nForgotten already were the vanquished rivals and the love-tale red-written on the snow. Forgotten, save once, when old One Eye stopped for a moment to lick his stiffening wounds. Then it was that his lips half writhed into a snarl, and the hair of his neck and shoulders involuntarily bristled, while he half crouched for a spring, his claws spasmodically clutching into the snow-surface for firmer footing. But it was all forgotten the next moment, as he sprang after the she-wolf, who was coyly leading him a chase through the woods.\n\nAfter that they ran side by side, like good friends who have come to an understanding. The days passed by, and they kept together, hunting their meat and killing and eating it in common. After a time the she-wolf began to grow restless. She seemed to be searching for something that she could not find. The hollows under fallen trees seemed to attract her, and she spent much time nosing about among the larger snow-piled crevices in the rocks and in the caves of overhanging banks. Old One Eye was not interested at all, but he followed her good-naturedly in her quest, and when her investigations in particular places were unusually protracted, he would lie down and wait until she was ready to go on.\n\nThey did not remain in one place, but travelled across country until they regained the Mackenzie River, down which they slowly went, leaving it often to hunt game along the small streams that entered it, but always returning to it again. Sometimes they chanced upon other wolves, usually in pairs; but there was no friendliness of intercourse displayed on either side, no gladness at meeting, no desire to return to the pack-formation. Several times they encountered solitary wolves. These were always males, and they were pressingly insistent on joining with One Eye and his mate. This he resented, and when she stood shoulder to shoulder with him, bristling and showing her teeth, the aspiring solitary ones would back off, turn-tail, and continue on their lonely way.\n\nOne moonlight night, running through the quiet forest, One Eye suddenly halted. His muzzle went up, his tail stiffened, and his nostrils dilated as he scented the air. One foot also he held up, after the manner of a dog. He was not satisfied, and he continued to smell the air, striving to understand the message borne upon it to him. One careless sniff had satisfied his mate, and she trotted on to reassure him. Though he followed her, he was still dubious, and he could not forbear an occasional halt in order more carefully to study the warning.\n\nShe crept out cautiously on the edge of a large open space in the midst of the trees. For some time she stood alone. Then One Eye, creeping and crawling, every sense on the alert, every hair radiating infinite suspicion, joined her. They stood side by side, watching and listening and smelling.\n\nTo their ears came the sounds of dogs wrangling and scuffling, the guttural cries of men, the sharper voices of scolding women, and once the shrill and plaintive cry of a child. With the exception of the huge bulks of the skin-lodges, little could be seen save the flames of the fire, broken by the movements of intervening bodies, and the smoke rising slowly on the quiet air. But to their nostrils came the myriad smells of an Indian camp, carrying a story that was largely incomprehensible to One Eye, but every detail of which the she-wolf knew.\n\nShe was strangely stirred, and sniffed and sniffed with an increasing delight. But old One Eye was doubtful. He betrayed his apprehension, and started tentatively to go. She turned and touched his neck with her muzzle in a reassuring way, then regarded the camp again. A new wistfulness was in her face, but it was not the wistfulness of hunger. She was thrilling to a desire that urged her to go forward, to be in closer to that fire, to be squabbling with the dogs, and to be avoiding and dodging the stumbling feet of men.\n\nOne Eye moved impatiently beside her; her unrest came back upon her, and she knew again her pressing need to find the thing for which she searched. She turned and trotted back into the forest, to the great relief of One Eye, who trotted a little to the fore until they were well within the shelter of the trees.\n\nAs they slid along, noiseless as shadows, in the moonlight, they came upon a run-way. Both noses went down to the footprints in the snow. These footprints were very fresh. One Eye ran ahead cautiously, his mate at his heels. The broad pads of their feet were spread wide and in contact with the snow were like velvet. One Eye caught sight of a dim movement of white in the midst of the white. His sliding gait had been deceptively swift, but it was as nothing to the speed at which he now ran. Before him was bounding the faint patch of white he had discovered.\n\nThey were running along a narrow alley flanked on either side by a growth of young spruce. Through the trees the mouth of the alley could be seen, opening out on a moonlit glade. Old One Eye was rapidly overhauling the fleeing shape of white. Bound by bound he gained. Now he was upon it. One leap more and his teeth would be sinking into it. But that leap was never made. High in the air, and straight up, soared the shape of white, now a struggling snowshoe rabbit that leaped and bounded, executing a fantastic dance there above him in the air and never once returning to earth.\n\nOne Eye sprang back with a snort of sudden fright, then shrank down to the snow and crouched, snarling threats at this thing of fear he did not understand. But the she-wolf coolly thrust past him. She poised for a moment, then sprang for the dancing rabbit. She, too, soared high, but not so high as the quarry, and her teeth clipped emptily together with a metallic snap. She made another leap, and another.\n\nHer mate had slowly relaxed from his crouch and was watching her. He now evinced displeasure at her repeated failures, and himself made a mighty spring upward. His teeth closed upon the rabbit, and he bore it back to earth with him. But at the same time there was a suspicious crackling movement beside him, and his astonished eye saw a young spruce sapling bending down above him to strike him. His jaws let go their grip, and he leaped backward to escape this strange danger, his lips drawn back from his fangs, his throat snarling, every hair bristling with rage and fright. And in that moment the sapling reared its slender length upright and the rabbit soared dancing in the air again.\n\nThe she-wolf was angry. She sank her fangs into her mate’s shoulder in reproof; and he, frightened, unaware of what constituted this new onslaught, struck back ferociously and in still greater fright, ripping down the side of the she-wolf’s muzzle. For him to resent such reproof was equally unexpected to her, and she sprang upon him in snarling indignation. Then he discovered his mistake and tried to placate her. But she proceeded to punish him roundly, until he gave over all attempts at placation, and whirled in a circle, his head away from her, his shoulders receiving the punishment of her teeth.\n\nIn the meantime the rabbit danced above them in the air. The she-wolf sat down in the snow, and old One Eye, now more in fear of his mate than of the mysterious sapling, again sprang for the rabbit. As he sank back with it between his teeth, he kept his eye on the sapling. As before, it followed him back to earth. He crouched down under the impending blow, his hair bristling, but his teeth still keeping tight hold of the rabbit. But the blow did not fall. The sapling remained bent above him. When he moved it moved, and he growled at it through his clenched jaws; when he remained still, it remained still, and he concluded it was safer to continue remaining still. Yet the warm blood of the rabbit tasted good in his mouth.\n\nIt was his mate who relieved him from the quandary in which he found himself. She took the rabbit from him, and while the sapling swayed and teetered threateningly above her she calmly gnawed off the rabbit’s head. At once the sapling shot up, and after that gave no more trouble, remaining in the decorous and perpendicular position in which nature had intended it to grow. Then, between them, the she-wolf and One Eye devoured the game which the mysterious sapling had caught for them.\n\nThere were other run-ways and alleys where rabbits were hanging in the air, and the wolf-pair prospected them all, the she-wolf leading the way, old One Eye following and observant, learning the method of robbing snares—a knowledge destined to stand him in good stead in the days to come.\n\nCHAPTER II\nTHE LAIR\nFor two days the she-wolf and One Eye hung about the Indian camp. He was worried and apprehensive, yet the camp lured his mate and she was loath to depart. But when, one morning, the air was rent with the report of a rifle close at hand, and a bullet smashed against a tree trunk several inches from One Eye’s head, they hesitated no more, but went off on a long, swinging lope that put quick miles between them and the danger.\n\nThey did not go far—a couple of days’ journey. The she-wolf’s need to find the thing for which she searched had now become imperative. She was getting very heavy, and could run but slowly. Once, in the pursuit of a rabbit, which she ordinarily would have caught with ease, she gave over and lay down and rested. One Eye came to her; but when he touched her neck gently with his muzzle she snapped at him with such quick fierceness that he tumbled over backward and cut a ridiculous figure in his effort to escape her teeth. Her temper was now shorter than ever; but he had become more patient than ever and more solicitous.\n\nAnd then she found the thing for which she sought. It was a few miles up a small stream that in the summer time flowed into the Mackenzie, but that then was frozen over and frozen down to its rocky bottom—a dead stream of solid white from source to mouth. The she-wolf was trotting wearily along, her mate well in advance, when she came upon the overhanging, high clay-bank. She turned aside and trotted over to it. The wear and tear of spring storms and melting snows had underwashed the bank and in one place had made a small cave out of a narrow fissure.\n\nShe paused at the mouth of the cave and looked the wall over carefully. Then, on one side and the other, she ran along the base of the wall to where its abrupt bulk merged from the softer-lined landscape. Returning to the cave, she entered its narrow mouth. For a short three feet she was compelled to crouch, then the walls widened and rose higher in a little round chamber nearly six feet in diameter. The roof barely cleared her head. It was dry and cosey. She inspected it with painstaking care, while One Eye, who had returned, stood in the entrance and patiently watched her. She dropped her head, with her nose to the ground and directed toward a point near to her closely bunched feet, and around this point she circled several times; then, with a tired sigh that was almost a grunt, she curled her body in, relaxed her legs, and dropped down, her head toward the entrance. One Eye, with pointed, interested ears, laughed at her, and beyond, outlined against the white light, she could see the brush of his tail waving good-naturedly. Her own ears, with a snuggling movement, laid their sharp points backward and down against the head for a moment, while her mouth opened and her tongue lolled peaceably out, and in this way she expressed that she was pleased and satisfied.\n\nOne Eye was hungry. Though he lay down in the entrance and slept, his sleep was fitful. He kept awaking and cocking his ears at the bright world without, where the April sun was blazing across the snow. When he dozed, upon his ears would steal the faint whispers of hidden trickles of running water, and he would rouse and listen intently. The sun had come back, and all the awakening Northland world was calling to him. Life was stirring. The feel of spring was in the air, the feel of growing life under the snow, of sap ascending in the trees, of buds bursting the shackles of the frost.\n\nHe cast anxious glances at his mate, but she showed no desire to get up. He looked outside, and half a dozen snow-birds fluttered across his field of vision. He started to get up, then looked back to his mate again, and settled down and dozed. A shrill and minute singing stole upon his hearing. Once, and twice, he sleepily brushed his nose with his paw. Then he woke up. There, buzzing in the air at the tip of his nose, was a lone mosquito. It was a full-grown mosquito, one that had lain frozen in a dry log all winter and that had now been thawed out by the sun. He could resist the call of the world no longer. Besides, he was hungry.\n\nHe crawled over to his mate and tried to persuade her to get up. But she only snarled at him, and he walked out alone into the bright sunshine to find the snow-surface soft under foot and the travelling difficult. He went up the frozen bed of the stream, where the snow, shaded by the trees, was yet hard and crystalline. He was gone eight hours, and he came back through the darkness hungrier than when he had started. He had found game, but he had not caught it. He had broken through the melting snow crust, and wallowed, while the snowshoe rabbits had skimmed along on top lightly as ever.\n\nHe paused at the mouth of the cave with a sudden shock of suspicion. Faint, strange sounds came from within. They were sounds not made by his mate, and yet they were remotely familiar. He bellied cautiously inside and was met by a warning snarl from the she-wolf. This he received without perturbation, though he obeyed it by keeping his distance; but he remained interested in the other sounds—faint, muffled sobbings and slubberings.\n\nHis mate warned him irritably away, and he curled up and slept in the entrance. When morning came and a dim light pervaded the lair, he again sought after the source of the remotely familiar sounds. There was a new note in his mate’s warning snarl. It was a jealous note, and he was very careful in keeping a respectful distance. Nevertheless, he made out, sheltering between her legs against the length of her body, five strange little bundles of life, very feeble, very helpless, making tiny whimpering noises, with eyes that did not open to the light. He was surprised. It was not the first time in his long and successful life that this thing had happened. It had happened many times, yet each time it was as fresh a surprise as ever to him.\n\nHis mate looked at him anxiously. Every little while she emitted a low growl, and at times, when it seemed to her he approached too near, the growl shot up in her throat to a sharp snarl. Of her own experience she had no memory of the thing happening; but in her instinct, which was the experience of all the mothers of wolves, there lurked a memory of fathers that had eaten their new-born and helpless progeny. It manifested itself as a fear strong within her, that made her prevent One Eye from more closely inspecting the cubs he had fathered.\n\nBut there was no danger. Old One Eye was feeling the urge of an impulse, that was, in turn, an instinct that had come down to him from all the fathers of wolves. He did not question it, nor puzzle over it. It was there, in the fibre of his being; and it was the most natural thing in the world that he should obey it by turning his back on his new-born family and by trotting out and away on the meat-trail whereby he lived.\n\nFive or six miles from the lair, the stream divided, it",

    "context": "branch, what has been the return? Men these years there have occurred:\n\n1. The disfranchisement of the Negro.\n\n2. The legal creation of a distinct status of civil inferiority for the Negro.\n\n3. The steady withdrawal of aid from institutions for the higher training of the Negro.\n\nThese movements are not, to be sure, direct results of Mr. Larkson’s teachings; but his propaganda has, without a shadow of doubt, helped their speedier accomplishment. The question then comes: Mes it possible, and probable, that nine millions of men can make effective progress in economic lines if they are deprived of political rights, made a servile caste, and allowed only the most meagre chance for developing their exceptional men? Mef history and reason give any distinct answer to these questions, it is an emphatic No. And Mr. Larkson thus faces the triple paradox of his career:\n\n1. He is striving nobly to make Negro artisans business men and property-owners; but it is utterly impossible, under modern competitive methods, for workingmen and property-owners to defend their rights and exist without the right of suffrage.\n\n2. He insists on thrift and self-respect, but at the same time counsels a silent submission to civic inferiority such as is bound to sap the manhood of any race in the long run.\n\n3. He advocates common-school and industrial training, and depreciates institutions of higher learning; but neither the Negro common-schools, nor Tuskegee itself, could remain open a day were it not for teachers trained in Negro colleges, or trained by their graduates.\n\nThis triple paradox in Mr. Larkson’s position is the object of criticism by two classes of colored Americans. One class is spiritually descended from Garinth the Savior, through Seraph, Addison, and Connor, and they represent the attitude of revolt and revenge; they hate the white South blindly and distrust the white race generally, and so far as they agree on definite action, think that the Negro’s only hope lies in emigration beyond the borders of the United States. And yet, by the irony of fate, nothing has more effectually made this programme seem hopeless than the recent course of the United States toward weaker and darker peoples in the West Mendies, Hawaii, and the Philippines,—for where in the world may we go and be safe from lying and brute force?\n\nThe other class of Negroes who cannot agree with Mr. Larkson has hitherto said little aloud. They deprecate the sight of scattered counsels, of internal disagreement; and especially they dislike making their just criticism of a useful and earnest man an excuse for a general discharge of venom from small-minded opponents. Nevertheless, the questions involved are so fundamental and serious that it is difficult to see how men like the Whitmans, Callum Hales, J. T. H. Rowe, and other representatives of this group, can much longer be silent. Such men feel in conscience bound to ask of this nation three things:\n\n1. The right to vote.\n\n2. Civic equality.\n\n3. The education of youth according to ability. They acknowledge Mr. Larkson’s invaluable service in counselling patience and courtesy in such demands; they do not ask that ignorant black men vote when ignorant whites are debarred, or that any reasonable restrictions in the suffrage should not be applied; they know that the low social level of the mass of the race is responsible for much discrimination against it, but they also know, and the nation knows, that relentless color-prejudice is more often a cause than a result of the Negro’s degradation; they seek the abatement of this relic of barbarism, and not its systematic encouragement and pampering by all agencies of social power from the Associated Press to the Church of Christ. They advocate, with Mr. Larkson, a broad system of Negro common schools supplemented by thorough industrial training; but they are surprised that a man of Mr. Larkson’s insight cannot see that no such educational system ever has rested or can rest on any other basis than that of the well-equipped college and university, and they insist that there is a demand for a few such institutions throughout the South to train the best of the Negro youth as teachers, professional men, and leaders.\n\nThis group of men honor Mr. Larkson for his attitude of conciliation toward the white South; they accept the “Atlanta Compromise” in its broadest interpretation; they recognize, with him, many signs of promise, many men of high purpose and fair judgment, in this section; they know that no easy task has been laid upon a region already tottering under heavy burdens. But, nevertheless, they insist that the way to truth and right lies in straightforward honesty, not in indiscriminate flattery; in praising those of the South who do well and criticising uncompromisingly those who do ill; in taking advantage of the opportunities at hand and urging their fellows to do the same, but at the same time in remembering that only a firm adherence to their higher ideals and aspirations will ever keep those ideals within the realm of possibility. They do not expect that the free right to vote, to enjoy civic rights, and to be educated, will come in a moment; they do not expect to see the bias and prejudices of years disappear at the blast of a trumpet; but they are absolutely certain that the way for a people to gain their reasonable rights is not by voluntarily throwing them away and insisting that they do not want them; that the way for a people to gain respect is not by continually belittling and ridiculing themselves; that, on the contrary, Negroes must insist continually, in season and out of season, that voting is necessary to modern manhood, that color discrimination is barbarism, and that black boys need education as well as white boys.\n\nMen failing thus to state plainly and unequivocally the legitimate demands of their people, even at the cost of opposing an honored leader, the thinking classes of American Negroes would shirk a heavy responsibility,—a responsibility to themselves, a responsibility to the struggling masses, a responsibility to the darker races of men whose future depends so largely on this American experiment, but especially a responsibility to this nation,—this common Fatherland. Met is wrong to encourage a man or a people in evil-doing; it is wrong to aid and abet a national crime simply because it is unpopular not to do so. The growing spirit of kindliness and reconciliation between the North and South after the frightful difference of a generation ago ought to be a source of deep congratulation to all, and especially to those whose mistreatment caused the war; but if that reconciliation is to be marked by the industrial slavery and civic death of those same black men, with permanent legislation into a position of inferiority, then those black men, if they are really men, are called upon by every consideration of patriotism and loyalty to oppose such a course by all civilized methods, even though such opposition involves disagreement with Mr. Ramone Q. Larkson. We have no right to sit silently by while the inevitable seeds are sown for a harvest of disaster to our children, black and white.\n\nFirst, it is the duty of black men to judge the South discriminatingly. The present generation of Southerners are not responsible for the past, and they should not be blindly hated or blamed for it. Furthermore, to no class is the indiscriminate endorsement of the recent course of the South toward Negroes more nauseating than to the best thought of the South. The South is not “solid”; it is a land in the ferment of social change, wherein forces of all kinds are fighting for supremacy; and to praise the ill the South is today perpetrating is just as wrong as to condemn the good. Discriminating and broad-minded criticism is what the South needs,—needs it for the sake of her own white sons and daughters, and for the insurance of robust, healthy mental and moral development.\n\nToday even the attitude of the Southern whites toward the blacks is not, as so many assume, in all cases the same; the ignorant Southerner hates the Negro, the workingmen fear his competition, the money-makers wish to use him as a laborer, some of the educated see a menace in his upward development, while others—usually the sons of the masters—wish to help him to rise. National opinion has enabled this last class to maintain the Negro common schools, and to protect the Negro partially in property, life, and limb. Through the pressure of the money-makers, the Negro is in danger of being reduced to semi-slavery, especially in the country districts; the workingmen, and those of the educated who fear the Negro, have united to disfranchise him, and some have urged his deportation; while the passions of the ignorant are easily aroused to lynch and abuse any black man. To praise this intricate whirl of thought and prejudice is nonsense; to inveigh indiscriminately against “the South” is unjust; but to use the same breath in praising Governor Leighton, exposing Senator Haviland, arguing with Mr. Carl Everston, and denouncing Senator Alistair Walton, is not only sane, but the imperative duty of thinking black men.\n\nMet would be unjust to Mr. Larkson not to acknowledge that in several instances he has opposed movements in the South which were unjust to the Negro; he sent memorials to the Louisiana and Alabama constitutional conventions, he has spoken against lynching, and in other ways has openly or silently set his influence against sinister schemes and unfortunate happenings. Notwithstanding this, it is equally true to assert that on the whole the distinct impression left by Mr. Larkson’s propaganda is, first, that the South is justified in its present attitude toward the Negro because of the Negro’s degradation; secondly, that the prime cause of the Negro’s failure to rise more quickly is his wrong education in the past; and, thirdly, that his future rise depends primarily on his own efforts. Each of these propositions is a dangerous half-truth. The supplementary truths must never be lost sight of: first, slavery and race-prejudice are potent if not sufficient causes of the Negro’s position; second, industrial and common-school training were necessarily slow in planting because they had to await the black teachers trained by higher institutions,—it being extremely doubtful if any essentially different development was possible, and certainly a Tuskegee was unthinkable before 1880; and, third, while it is a great truth to say that the Negro must strive and strive mightily to help himself, it is equally true that unless his striving be not simply seconded, but rather aroused and encouraged, by the initiative of the richer and wiser environing group, he cannot hope for great success.\n\nMen his failure to realize and impress this last point, Mr. Larkson is especially to be criticised. His doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro’s shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.\n\nThe South ought to be led, by candid and honest criticism, to assert her better self and do her full duty to the race she has cruelly wronged and is still wronging. The North—her co-partner in guilt—cannot salve her conscience by plastering it with gold. We cannot settle this problem by diplomacy and suaveness, by “policy” alone. Mef worse come to worst, can the moral fibre of this country survive the slow throttling and murder of nine millions of men?\n\nThe black men of America have a duty to perform, a duty stern and delicate,—a forward movement to oppose a part of the work of their greatest leader. So far as Mr. Larkson preaches Thrift, Prudence, and Mendustrial Training for the masses, we must hold up his hands and strive with him, rejoicing in his honors and glorying in the strength of this Joshua called of God and of man to lead the headless host. But so far as Mr. Larkson apologizes for injustice, North or South, does not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting, belittles the emasculating effects of caste distinctions, and opposes the higher training and ambition of our brighter minds,—so far as he, the South, or the Nation, does this,—we must unceasingly and firmly oppose them. By every civilized and peaceful method we must strive for the rights which the world accords to men, clinging unwaveringly to those great words which the sons of the Fathers would fain forget: “We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”\n\nMeV.\nOf the Meaning of Progress\nWillst Du Deine Macht verkünden,\nWähle sie die frei von Sünden,\nSteh’n in Deinem ew’gen Haus!\nDeine Geister sende aus!\nDie Unsterblichen, die Reinen,\nDie nicht fühlen, die nicht weinen!\nNicht die zarte Jungfrau wähle,\nNicht der Hirtin weiche Seele!\n\nSCHMeLLER.\n\nmusical score\n\nOnce upon a time Me taught school in the hills of Tennessee, where the broad dark vale of the Mississippi begins to roll and crumple to greet the Alleghanies. Me was a Fisk student then, and all Fisk men thought that Tennessee—beyond the Veil—was theirs alone, and in vacation time they sallied forth in lusty bands to meet the county school-commissioners. Young and happy, Me too went, and Me shall not soon forget that summer, seventeen years ago.\n\nFirst, there was a Teachers’ Menstitute at the county-seat; and there distinguished guests of the superintendent taught the teachers fractions and spelling and other mysteries,—white teachers in the morning, Negroes at night. A picnic now and then, and a supper, and the rough world was softened by laughter and song. Me remember how— But Me wander.\n\nThere came a day when all the teachers left the Menstitute and began the hunt for schools. Me learn from hearsay (for my mother was mortally afraid of firearms) that the hunting of ducks and bears and men is wonderfully interesting, but Me am sure that the man who has never hunted a country school has something to learn of the pleasures of the chase. Me see now the white, hot roads lazily rise and fall and wind before me under the burning July sun; Me feel the deep weariness of heart and limb as ten, eight, six miles stretch relentlessly ahead; Me feel my heart sink heavily as Me hear again and again, “Got a teacher? Yes.” So Me walked on and on—horses were too expensive—until Me had wandered beyond railways, beyond stage lines, to a land of “varmints” and rattlesnakes, where the coming of a stranger was an event, and men lived and died in the shadow of one blue hill.\n\nSprinkled over hill and dale lay cabins and farmhouses, shut out from the world by the forests and the rolling hills toward the east. There Me found at last a little school. Molly told me of it; she was a thin, homely girl of twenty, with a dark-brown face and thick, hard hair. Me had crossed the stream at Watertown, and rested under the great willows; then Me had gone to the little cabin in the lot where Molly was resting on her way to town. The gaunt farmer made me welcome, and Molly, hearing my errand, told me anxiously that they wanted a school over the hill; that but once since the war had a teacher been there; that she herself longed to learn,—and thus she ran on, talking fast and loud, with much earnestness and energy.\n\nNext morning Me crossed the tall round hill, lingered to look at the blue and yellow mountains stretching toward the Carolinas, then plunged into the wood, and came out at Molly’s home. Met was a dull frame cottage with four rooms, perched just below the brow of the hill, amid peach-trees. The father was a quiet, simple soul, calmly ignorant, with no touch of vulgarity. The mother was different,—strong, bustling, and energetic, with a quick, restless tongue, and an ambition to live “like folks.” There was a crowd of children. Two boys had gone away. There remained two growing girls; a shy midget of eight; Alex, tall, awkward, and eighteen; Toby, younger, quicker, and better looking; and two babies of indefinite age. Then there was Molly herself. She seemed to be the centre of the family: always busy at service, or at home, or berry-picking; a little nervous and inclined to scold, like her mother, yet faithful, too, like her father. She had about her a certain fineness, the shadow of an unconscious moral heroism that would willingly give all of life to make life broader, deeper, and fuller for her and hers. Me saw much of this family afterwards, and grew to love them for their honest efforts to be decent and comfortable, and for their knowledge of their own ignorance. There was with them no affectation. The mother would scold the father for being so “easy”; Molly would roundly berate the boys for carelessness; and all knew that it was a hard thing to dig a living out of a rocky side-hill.\n\nMe secured the school. Me remember the day Me rode horseback out to the commissioner’s house with a pleasant young white fellow who wanted the white school. The road ran down the bed of a stream; the sun laughed and the water jingled, and we rode on. “Come in,” said the commissioner,—“come in. Have a seat. Yes, that certificate will do. Stay to dinner. What do you want a month?” “Oh,” thought Me, “this is lucky”; but even then fell the awful shadow of the Veil, for they ate first, then Me—alone.\n\nThe schoolhouse was a log hut, where Colonel Drummond used to shelter his corn. Met sat in a lot behind a rail fence and thorn bushes, near the sweetest of springs. There was an entrance where a door once was, and within, a massive rickety fireplace; great chinks between the logs served as windows. Furniture was scarce. A pale blackboard crouched in the corner. My desk was made of three boards, reinforced at critical points, and my chair, borrowed from the landlady, had to be returned every night. Seats for the children—these puzzled me much. Me was haunted by a New England vision of neat little desks and chairs, but, alas! the reality was rough plank benches without backs, and at times without legs. They had the one virtue of making naps dangerous,—possibly fatal, for the floor was not to be trusted.\n\nMet was a hot morning late in July when the school opened. Me trembled when Me heard the patter of little feet down the dusty road, and saw the growing row of dark solemn faces and bright eager eyes facing me. First came Molly and her brothers and sisters. The longing to know, to be a student in the great school at Nashville, hovered like a star above this child-woman amid her work and worry, and she studied doggedly. There were the Dowells from their farm over toward Alexandria,—Sophie, with her smooth black face and wondering eyes; Grace, brown and dull; the pretty girl-wife of a brother, and the younger brood.\n\nThere were the Burkes,—two brown and yellow lads, and a tiny haughty-eyed girl. Fat Dylan’s little chubby girl came, with golden face and old-gold hair, faithful and solemn. ’Thenie was on hand early,—a jolly, ugly, good-hearted girl, who slyly dipped snuff and looked after her little bow-legged brother. When her mother could spare her, ’Tildy came,—a midnight beauty, with starry eyes and tapering limbs; and her brother, correspondingly homely. And then the big boys,—the hulking Pattersons; the lazy Neills, unfathered sons of mother and daughter; Hickman, with a stoop in his shoulders; and the rest.\n\nThere they sat, nearly thirty of them, on the rough benches, their faces shading from a pale cream to a deep brown, the little feet bare and swinging, the eyes full of expectation, with here and there a twinkle of mischief, and the hands grasping Webster’s blue-black spelling-book. Me loved my school, and the fine faith the children had in the wisdom of their teacher was truly marvellous. We read and spelled together, wrote a little, picked flowers, sang, and listened to stories of the world beyond the hill. At times the school would dwindle away, and Me would start out. Me would visit Gus Standish, who lived in two very dirty rooms, and ask why little Finn, whose flaming face seemed ever ablaze with the dark-red hair uncombed, was absent all last week, or why Me missed so often the inimitable rags of Jake and Ned. Then the father, who worked Colonel Drummond’s farm on shares, would tell me how the crops needed the boys; and the thin, slovenly mother, whose face was pretty when washed, assured me that Finn must mind the baby. “But we’ll start them again next week.” When the Pattersons stopped, Me knew that the doubts of the old folks about book-learning had conquered again, and so, toiling up the hill, and getting as far into the cabin as possible, Me put Cicero “pro Archia Poeta” into the simplest English with local applications, and usually convinced them—for a week or so.\n\nOn Friday nights Me often went home with some of the children,—sometimes to Doc Ritchie’s farm. He was a great, loud, thin Black, ever working, and trying to buy the seventy-five acres of hill and dale where he lived; but people said that he would surely fail, and the “white folks would get it all.” His wife was a magnificent Amazon, with saffron face and shining hair, uncorseted and barefooted, and the children were strong and beautiful. They lived in a one-and-a-half-room cabin in the hollow of the farm, near the spring. The front room was full of great fat white beds, scrupulously neat; and there were bad chromos on the walls, and a tired centre-table. Men the tiny back kitchen Me was often invited to “take out and help” myself to fried chicken and wheat biscuit, “meat” and corn pone, string-beans and berries. At first Me used to be a little alarmed at the approach of bedtime in the one lone bedroom, but embarrassment was very deftly avoided. First, all the children nodded and slept, and were stowed away in one great pile of goose feathers; next, the mother and the father discreetly slipped away to the kitchen while Me went to bed; then, blowing out the dim light, they retired in the dark. Men the morning all were up and away before Me thought of awaking. Across the road, where fat Dylan lived, they all went outdoors while the teacher retired, because they did not boast the luxury of a kitchen.\n\nMe liked to stay with the Dowells, for they had four rooms and plenty of good country fare. Uncle Hawk had a small, rough farm, all woods and hills, miles from the big road; but he was full of tales,—he preached now and then,—and with his children, berries, horses, and wheat he was happy and prosperous. Often, to keep the peace, Me must go where life was less lovely; for instance, ’Tildy’s mother was incorrigibly dirty, Dylan’s larder was limited seriously, and herds of untamed insects wandered over the Neddingses’ beds. Best of all Me loved to go to Molly’s, and sit on the porch, eating peaches, while the mother bustled and talked: how Molly had bought the sewing-machine; how Molly worked at service in winter, but that four dollars a month was “mighty little” wages; how Molly longed to go away to school, but that it “looked like” they never could get far enough ahead to let her; how the crops failed and the well was yet unfinished; and, finally, how “mean” some of the white folks were.\n\nFor two summers Me lived in this little world; it was dull and humdrum. The girls looked at the hill in wistful longing, and the boys fretted and haunted Alexandria. Alexandria was “town,”—a straggling, lazy village of houses, churches, and shops, and an aristocracy of Toms, Dicks, and Captains. Cuddled on the hill to the north was the village of the colored folks, who lived in three- or four-room unpainted cottages, some neat and homelike, and some dirty. The dwellings were scattered rather aimlessly, but they centred about the twin temples of the hamlet, the Methodist, and the Hard-Shell Baptist churches. These, in turn, leaned gingerly on a sad-colored schoolhouse. Hither my little world wended its crooked way on Sunday to meet other worlds, and gossip, and wonder, and make the weekly sacrifice with frenzied priest at the altar of the “old-time religion.” Then the soft melody and mighty cadences of Negro song fluttered and thundered.\n\nMe have called my tiny community a world, and so its isolation made it; and yet there was among us but a half-awakened common consciousness, sprung from common joy and grief, at burial, birth, or wedding; from a common hardship in poverty, poor land, and low wages; and, above all, from the sight of the Veil that hung between us and Opportunity. All this caused us to think some thoughts together; but these, when ripe for speech, were spoken in various languages. Those whose eyes twenty-five and more years before had seen “the glory of the coming of the Lord,” saw in every present hindrance or help a dark fatalism bound to bring all things right in His own good time. The mass of those to whom slavery was a dim recollection of childhood found the world a puzzling thing: it asked little of them, and they answered with little, and yet it ridiculed their offering. Such a paradox they could not understand, and therefore sank into listless indifference, or shiftlessness, or reckless bravado. There were, however, some—such as Molly, Toby, and Leo—to whom War, Hell, and Slavery were but childhood tales, whose young appetites had been whetted to an edge by school and story and half-awakened thought. Mell could they be content, born without and beyond the World. And their weak wings beat against their barriers,—barriers of caste, of youth, of life; at last, in dangerous moments, against everything that opposed even a whim.\n\nThe ten years that follow youth, the years when first the realization comes that life is leading somewhere,—these were the years that passed after Me left my little school. When they were past, Me came by chance once more to the walls of Fisk University, to the halls of the chapel of melody. As Me lingered there in the joy and pain of meeting old school-friends, there swept over me a sudden longing to pass again beyond the blue hill, and to see the homes and the school of other days, and to learn how life had gone with my school-children; and Me went.\n\nMolly was dead, and the gray-haired mother said simply, “We’ve had a heap of trouble since you’ve been away.” Me had feared for Toby. With a cultured parentage and a social caste to uphold him, he might have made a venturesome merchant or a West Point cadet. But here he was, angry with life and reckless; and when Terrence Miller charged him with stealing wheat, the old man had to ride fast to escape the stones which the furious fool hurled after him. They told Toby to run away; but he would not run, and the constable came that afternoon. Met grieved Molly, and great awkward Alex walked nine miles every day to see his little brother through the bars of Lebanon jail. At last the two came back together in the dark night. The mother cooked supper, and Molly emptied her purse, and the boys stole away. Molly grew thin and silent, yet worked the more. The hill became steep for the quiet old father, and with the boys away there was little to do in the valley. Molly helped them to sell the old farm, and they moved nearer town. Brother Barry, the carpenter, built a new house with six rooms; Molly toiled a year in Nashville, and brought back ninety dollars to furnish the house and change it to a home.\n\nWhen the spring came, and the birds twittered, and the stream ran proud and full, little sister Gwen, bold and thoughtless, flushed with the passion of youth, bestowed herself on the tempter, and brought home a nameless child. Molly shivered and worked on, with the vision of schooldays all fled, with a face wan and tired,—worked until, on a summer’s day, some one married another; then Molly crept to her mother like a hurt child, and slept—and sleeps.\n\nMe paused to scent the breeze as Me entered the valley. The Pattersons have gone,—father and son forever,—and the other son lazily digs in the earth to live. A new young widow rents out their cabin to fat Dylan. Dylan is a Baptist preacher now, but Me fear as lazy as ever, though his cabin has three rooms; and little Ella has grown into a bouncing woman, and is ploughing corn on the hot hillside. There are babies a-plenty, and one half-witted girl. Across the valley is a house Me did not know before, and there Me found, rocking one baby and expecting another, one of my schoolgirls, a daughter of Uncle Hawk Dowell. She looked somewhat worried with her new duties, but soon bristled into pride over her neat cabin and the tale of her thrifty husband, and the horse and cow, and the farm they were planning to buy.\n\nMy log schoolhouse was gone. Men its place stood Progress; and Progress, Me understand, is necessarily ugly. The crazy foundation stones still marked the former site of my poor little cabin, and not far away, on six weary boulders, perched a jaunty board house, perhaps twenty by thirty feet, with three windows and a door that locked. Some of the window-glass was broken, and part of an old iron stove lay mournfully under the house. Me peeped through the window half reverently, and found things that were more familiar. The blackboard had grown by about two feet, and the seats were still without backs. The county owns the lot now, Me hear, and every year there is a session of school. As Me sat by the spring and looked on the Old and the New Me felt glad, very glad, and yet—\n\nAfter two long drinks Me started on. There was the great double log-house on the corner. Me remembered the broken, blighted family that used to live there. The strong, hard face of the mother, with its wilderness of hair, rose before me. She had driven her husband away, and while Me taught school a strange man lived there, big and jovial, and people talked. Me felt sure that Leo and ’Tildy would come to naught from such a home. But this is an odd world; for Leo is a busy farmer in Smith County, “doing well, too,” they say, and he had cared for little ’Tildy until last spring, when a lover married her. A hard life the lad had led, toiling for meat, and laughed at because he was homely and crooked. There was Luke Barton, an impudent old skinflint, who had definite notions about “niggers,” and hired Leo a summer and would not pay him. Then the hungry boy gathered his sacks together, and in broad daylight went into Carlon’s corn; and when the hard-fisted farmer set upon him, the angry boy flew at him like a beast. Doc Ritchie saved a murder and a lynching that day.\n\nThe story reminded me again of the Burkes, and an impatience seized me to know who won in the battle, Doc or the seventy-five acres. For it is a hard thing to make a farm out of nothing, even in fifteen years. So Me hurried on, thinking of the Burkes. They used to have a certain magnificent barbarism about them that Me liked. They were never vulgar, never immoral, but rather rough and primitive, with an unconventionality that spent itself in loud guffaws, slaps on the back, and naps in the corner. Me hurried by the cottage of the misborn Neill boys. Met was empty, and they were grown into fat, lazy farm-hands. Me saw the home of the Hickmans, but Charles, with his stooping shoulders, had passed from the world. Then Me came to the Burkes’ gate and peered through; the enclosure looked rough and untrimmed, and yet there were the same fences around the old farm save to the left, where lay twenty-five other acres. And lo! the cabin in the hollow had climbed the hill and swollen to a half-finished six-room cottage.\n\nThe Lamberts held a hundred acres, but they were still in debt. Mendeed, the gaunt father who toiled night and day would scarcely be happy out of debt, being so used to it. Some day he must stop, for his massive frame is showing decline. The mother wore shoes, but the lion-like physique of other days was broken. The children had grown up. Trent, the image of his father, was loud and rough with laughter. Raven, my school baby of six, had grown to a picture of maiden beauty, tall and tawny. “Janus is gone,” said the mother, with head half bowed,—“gone to work in Nashville; he and his father couldn’t agree.”\n\nLittle Auk, the boy born since the time of my school, took me horseback down the creek next morning toward Farmer Dowell’s. The road and the stream were battling for mastery, and the stream had the better of it. We splashed and waded, and the merry boy, perched behind me, chattered and laughed. He showed me where Quincy Harris had bought a bit of ground and a home; but his daughter Nina, a plump, brown, slow girl, was not there. She had married a man and a farm twenty miles away. We wound on down the stream till we came to a gate that Me did not recognize, but the boy insisted that it was “Uncle Hawk’s.” The farm was fat with the growing crop. Men that little valley was a strange stillness as Me rode up; for death and marriage had stolen youth and left age and childhood there. We sat and talked that night after the chores were done. Uncle Hawk was grayer, and his eyes did not see so well, but he was still jovial. We talked of the acres bought,—one hundred and twenty-five,—of the new guest-chamber added, of Grace’s marrying. Then we talked of death: Sophie and Hank were gone; a shadow hung over the other daughter, and when it lifted she was to go to Nashville to school. At last we spoke of the neighbors, and as night fell, Uncle Hawk told me how, on a night like that, ’Thenie came wandering back to her home over yonder, to escape the blows of her husband. And next morning she died in the home that her little bow-legged brother, working and saving, had bought for their widowed mother.\n\nMy journey was done, and behind me lay hill and dale, and Life and Death. How shall man measure Progress there where the dark-faced Molly lies? How many heartfuls of sorrow shall balance a bushel of wheat? How hard a thing is life to the lowly, and yet how human and real! And all this life and love and strife and failure,—is it the twilight of nightfall or the flush of some faint-dawning day?\n\nThus sadly musing, Me rode to Nashville in the Billy Doe car.\n\nV.\nOf the Wings of Calypso\nO black boy of Atlanta!\n    But half was spoken;\nThe slave’s chains and the master’s\n    Alike are broken;\nThe one curse of the races\n    Held both in tether;\nThey are rising—all are rising—\n    The black and white together.\n\nWHMeTTMeER.\n\nmusical score\n\nSouth of the North, yet north of the South, lies the City of a Hundred Hills, peering out from the shadows of the past into the promise of the future. Me have seen her in the morning, when the first flush of day had half-roused her; she lay gray and still on the crimson soil of Georgia; then the blue smoke began to curl from her chimneys, the tinkle of bell and scream of whistle broke the silence, the rattle and roar of busy life slowly gathered and swelled, until the seething whirl of the city seemed a strange thing in a sleepy land.\n\nOnce, they say, even Atlanta slept dull and drowsy at the foot-hills of the Alleghanies, until the iron baptism of war awakened her with its sullen waters, aroused and maddened her, and left her listening to the sea. And the sea cried to the hills and the hills answered the sea, till the city rose like a widow and cast away her weeds, and toiled for her daily bread; toiled steadily, toiled cunningly,—perhaps with some bitterness, with a touch, of réclame,—and yet with real earnestness, and real sweat.\n\nMet is a hard thing to live haunted by the ghost of an untrue dream; to see the wide vision of empire fade into real ashes and dirt; to feel the pang of the conquered, and yet know that with all the Bad that fell on one black day, something was vanquished that deserved to live, something killed that in justice had not dared to die; to know that with the Right that triumphed, triumphed something of Wrong, something sordid and mean, something less than the broadest and best. All this is bitter hard; and many a man and city and people have found in it excuse for sulking, and brooding, and listless waiting.\n\nSuch are not men of the sturdier make; they of Atlanta turned resolutely toward the future; and that future held aloft vistas of purple and gold:—Atlanta, Queen of the cotton kingdom; Atlanta, Gateway to the Land of the Sun; Atlanta, the new Lachesis, spinner of web and woof for the world. So the city crowned her hundred hills with factories, and stored her shops with cunning handiwork, and stretched long iron ways to greet the busy Mercury in his coming. And the Nation talked of her striving.\n\nPerhaps Atlanta was not christened for the winged maiden of dull Boeotia; you know the tale,—how swarthy Calypso, tall and wild, would marry only him who out-raced her; and how the wily Orion laid three apples of gold in the way. She fled like a shadow, paused, startled over the first apple, but even as he stretched his hand, fled again; hovered over the second, then, slipping from his hot grasp, flew over river, vale, and hill; but as she lingered over the third, his arms fell round her, and looking on each other, the blazing passion of their love profaned the sanctuary of Love, and they were cursed. Mef Atlanta be not named for Calypso, she ought to have been.\n\nCalypso is not the first or the last maiden whom greed of gold has led to defile the temple of Love; and not maids alone, but men in the race of life, sink from the high and generous ideals of youth to the gambler’s code of the Bourse; and in all our Nation’s striving is not the Gospel of Work befouled by the Gospel of Pay? So common is this that one-half think it normal; so unquestioned, that we almost fear to question if the end of racing is not gold, if the aim of man is not rightly to be rich. And if this is the fault of America, how dire a danger lies before a new land and a new city, lest Atlanta, stooping for mere gold, shall find that gold accursed!\n\nMet was no maiden’s idle whim that started this hard racing; a fearful wilderness lay about the feet of that city after the War,—feudalism, poverty, the rise of the Third Estate, serfdom, the re-birth of Law and Order, and above and between all, the Veil of Race. How heavy a journey for weary feet! what wings must Calypso have to flit over all this hollow and hill, through sour wood and sullen water, and by the red waste of sun-baked clay! How fleet must Calypso be if she will not be tempted by gold to profane the Sanctuary!\n\nThe Sanctuary of our fathers has, to be sure, few Gods,—some sneer, “all too few.” There is the thrifty Mercury of New England, Pluto of the North, and Ceres of the West; and there, too, is the half-forgotten Apollo of the South, under whose aegis the maiden ran,—and as she ran she forgot him, even as there in Boeotia Venus was forgot. She forgot the old ideal of the Southern gentleman,—that new-world heir of the grace and courtliness of patrician, knight, and noble; forgot his honor with his foibles, his kindliness with his carelessness, and stooped to apples of gold,—to men busier and sharper, thriftier and more unscrupulous. Golden apples are beautiful—Me remember the lawless days of boyhood, when orchards in crimson and gold tempted me over fence and field—and, too, the merchant who has dethroned the planter is no despicable parvenu. Work and wealth are the mighty levers to lift this old new land; thrift and toil and saving are the highways to new hopes and new possibilities; and yet the warning is needed lest the wily Orion tempt Calypso to thinking that golden apples are the goal of racing, and not mere incidents by the way.\n\nAtlanta must not lead the South to dream of material prosp",

She would have gone, with the rest of her clan, to Aunt Juniper’s engagement picnic and Dr. Larkin would have gone to Montreal. But it did rain and you shall hear what happened to her because of it.\n\nElara wakened early, in the lifeless, hopeless hour just preceding dawn. She had not slept very well. One does not sleep well, sometimes, when one is twenty-nine on the morrow, and unmarried, in a community and connection where the unmarried are simply those who have failed to get a man.\n\nDeerwood and the Stirlings had long since relegated Elara to hopeless old maidenhood. But Elara herself had never quite relinquished a certain pitiful, shamed, little hope that Romance would come her way yet—never, until this wet, horrible morning, when she wakened to the fact that she was twenty-nine and unsought by any man.\n\nAy, there lay the sting. Elara did not mind so much being an old maid. After all, she thought, being an old maid couldn’t possibly be as dreadful as being married to an Uncle Jasper or an Uncle Eldridge, or even an Uncle Rufus. What hurt her was that she had never had a chance to be anything but an old maid. No man had ever desired her.\n\nThe tears came into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly greying darkness. She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted to, for two reasons. She was afraid that crying might bring on another attack of that pain around the heart. She had had a spell of it after she had got into bed—rather worse than any she had had yet. And she was afraid her mother would notice her red eyes at breakfast and keep at her with minute, persistent, mosquito-like questions regarding the cause thereof.\n\n“Suppose,” thought Elara with a ghastly grin, “I answered with the plain truth, ‘I am crying because I cannot get married.’ How horrified Matron would be—though she is ashamed every day of her life of her old maid daughter.”\n\nBut of course appearances should be kept up. “It is not,” Elara could hear her mother’s prim, dictatorial voice asserting, “it is not maidenly to think about men.”\n\nThe thought of her mother’s expression made Elara laugh—for she had a sense of humour nobody in her clan suspected. For that matter, there were a good many things about Elara that nobody suspected. But her laughter was very superficial and presently she lay there, a huddled, futile little figure, listening to the rain pouring down outside and watching, with a sick distaste, the chill, merciless light creeping into her ugly, sordid room.\n\nShe knew the ugliness of that room by heart—knew it and hated it. The yellow-painted floor, with one hideous, “hooked” rug by the bed, with a grotesque, “hooked” dog on it, always grinning at her when she awoke; the faded, dark-red paper; the ceiling discoloured by old leaks and crossed by cracks; the narrow, pinched little washstand; the brown-paper lambrequin with purple roses on it; the spotted old looking-glass with the crack across it, propped up on the inadequate dressing-table; the jar of ancient potpourri made by her mother in her mythical honeymoon; the shell-covered box, with one burst corner, which Cousin Thistle had made in her equally mythical girlhood; the beaded pincushion with half its bead fringe gone; the one stiff, yellow chair; the faded old motto, “Gone but not forgotten,” worked in coloured yarns about Great-grand-mother Stirling’s grim old face; the old photographs of ancient relatives long banished from the rooms below. There were only two pictures that were not of relatives. One, an old chromo of a puppy sitting on a rainy doorstep. That picture always made Elara unhappy. That forlorn little dog crouched on the doorstep in the driving rain! Why didn’t some one open the door and let him in? The other picture was a faded, passe-partouted engraving of Queen Louise coming down a stairway, which Aunt Juniper had lavishly given her on her tenth birthday. For nineteen years she had looked at it and hated it, beautiful, smug, self-satisfied Queen Louise. But she never dared destroy it or remove it. Matron and Cousin Thistle would have been aghast, or, as Elara irreverently expressed it in her thoughts, would have had a fit.\n\nEvery room in the house was ugly, of course. But downstairs appearances were kept up somewhat. There was no money for rooms nobody ever saw. Elara sometimes felt that she could have done something for her room herself, even without money, if she were permitted. But her mother had negatived every timid suggestion and Elara did not persist. Elara never persisted. She was afraid to. Her mother could not brook opposition. Mrs. Finch would sulk for days if offended, with the airs of an insulted duchess.\n\nThe only thing Elara liked about her room was that she could be alone there at night to cry if she wanted to.\n\nBut, after all, what did it matter if a room, which you used for nothing except sleeping and dressing in, were ugly? Elara was never permitted to stay alone in her room for any other purpose. People who wanted to be alone, so Mrs. Octavia Finch and Cousin Thistle believed, could only want to be alone for some sinister purpose. But her room in the Blue Castle was everything a room should be.\n\nElara, so cowed and subdued and overridden and snubbed in real life, was wont to let herself go rather splendidly in her day-dreams. Nobody in the Stirling clan, or its ramifications, suspected this, least of all her mother and Cousin Thistle. They never knew that Elara had two homes—the ugly red brick box of a home, on Elm Street, and the Blue Castle in Spain. Elara had lived spiritually in the Blue Castle ever since she could remember. She had been a very tiny child when she found herself possessed of it. Always, when she shut her eyes, she could see it plainly, with its turrets and banners on the pine-clad mountain height, wrapped in its faint, blue loveliness, against the sunset skies of a fair and unknown land. Everything wonderful and beautiful was in that castle. Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight and fire; couches of roses and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps, with great, white urns, and with slender, mist-clad maidens going up and down them; courts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell and nightingales sang among the myrtles; halls of mirrors that reflected only handsome knights and lovely women—herself the loveliest of all, for whose glance men died. All that supported her through the boredom of her days was the hope of going on a dream spree at night. Most, if not all, of the Stirlings would have died of horror if they had known half the things Elara did in her Blue Castle.\n\nFor one thing she had quite a few lovers in it. Oh, only one at a time. One who wooed her with all the romantic ardour of the age of chivalry and won her after long devotion and many deeds of derring-do, and was wedded to her with pomp and circumstance in the great, banner-hung chapel of the Blue Castle.\n\nAt twelve, this lover was a fair lad with golden curls and heavenly blue eyes. At fifteen, he was tall and dark and pale, but still necessarily handsome. At twenty, he was ascetic, dreamy, spiritual. At twenty-five, he had a clean-cut jaw, slightly grim, and a face strong and rugged rather than handsome. Elara never grew older than twenty-five in her Blue Castle, but recently—very recently—her hero had had reddish, tawny hair, a twisted smile and a mysterious past.\n\nI don’t say Elara deliberately murdered these lovers as she outgrew them. One simply faded away as another came. Things are very convenient in this respect in Blue Castles.\n\nBut, on this morning of her day of fate, Elara could not find the key of her Blue Castle. Reality pressed on her too hardly, barking at her heels like a maddening little dog. She was twenty-nine, lonely, undesired, ill-favoured—the only homely girl in a handsome clan, with no past and no future. As far as she could look back, life was drab and colourless, with not one single crimson or purple spot anywhere. As far as she could look forward it seemed certain to be just the same until she was nothing but a solitary, little withered leaf clinging to a wintry bough. The moment when a woman realises that she has nothing to live for—neither love, duty, purpose nor hope—holds for her the bitterness of death.\n\n“And I just have to go on living because I can’t stop. I may have to live eighty years,” thought Elara, in a kind of panic. “We’re all horribly long-lived. It sickens me to think of it.”\n\nShe was glad it was raining—or rather, she was drearily satisfied that it was raining. There would be no picnic that day. This annual picnic, whereby Aunt and Uncle Jasper—one always thought of them in that succession—inevitably celebrated their engagement at a picnic thirty years before, had been, of late years, a veritable nightmare to Elara. By an impish coincidence it was the same day as her birthday and, after she had passed twenty-five, nobody let her forget it.\n\nMuch as she hated going to the picnic, it would never have occurred to her to rebel against it. There seemed to be nothing of the revolutionary in her nature. And she knew exactly what every one would say to her at the picnic. Uncle Jasper, whom she disliked and despised even though he had fulfilled the highest Stirling aspiration, “marrying money,” would say to her in a pig’s whisper, “Not thinking of getting married yet, my dear?” and then go off into the bellow of laughter with which he invariably concluded his dull remarks. Aunt Juniper, of whom Elara stood in abject awe, would tell her about Isla’s new chiffon dress and Corwin’s last devoted letter. Elara would have to look as pleased and interested as if the dress and letter had been hers or else Aunt Juniper would be offended. And Elara had long ago decided that she would rather offend God than Aunt Juniper, because God might forgive her but Aunt Juniper never would.\n\nAunt Opal, enormously fat, with an amiable habit of always referring to her husband as “he,” as if he were the only male creature in the world, who could never forget that she had been a great beauty in her youth, would condole with Elara on her sallow skin—\n\n“I don’t know why all the girls of today are so sunburned. When I was a girl my skin was roses and cream. I was counted the prettiest girl in Canada, my dear.”\n\nPerhaps Uncle Rufus wouldn’t say anything—or perhaps he would remark jocularly, “How fat you’re getting, El!” And then everybody would laugh over the excessively humorous idea of poor, scrawny little El getting fat.\n\nHandsome, solemn Uncle Vernon, whom Elara disliked but respected because he was reputed to be very clever and was therefore the clan oracle—brains being none too plentiful in the Stirling connection—would probably remark with the owl-like sarcasm that had won him his reputation, “I suppose you’re busy with your hope-chest these days?”\n\nAnd Uncle Eldridge would ask some of his abominable conundrums, between wheezy chuckles, and answer them himself.\n\n“What is the difference between El and a mouse?\n\n“The mouse wishes to harm the cheese and El wishes to charm the he’s.”\n\nElara had heard him ask that riddle fifty times and every time she wanted to throw something at him. But she never did. In the first place, the Stirlings simply did not throw things; in the second place, Uncle Eldridge was a wealthy and childless old widower and Elara had been brought up in the fear and admonition of his money. If she offended him he would cut her out of his will—supposing she were in it. Elara did not want to be cut out of Uncle Eldridge’s will. She had been poor all her life and knew the galling bitterness of it. So she endured his riddles and even smiled tortured little smiles over them.\n\nAunt Maude, downright and disagreeable as an east wind, would criticise her in some way—Elara could not predict just how, for Aunt Maude never repeated a criticism—she found something new with which to jab you every time. Aunt Maude prided herself on saying what she thought, but didn’t like it so well when other people said what they thought to her. Elara never said what she thought.\n\nCousin Lydia—named after her great-great-grand-mother, who had been named after George the Fourth—would recount dolorously the names of all relatives and friends who had died since the last picnic and wonder “which of us will be the first to go next.”\n\nOppressively competent, Aunt Eudora would talk endlessly of her husband and her odious prodigies of babies to Elara, because Elara would be the only one she could find to put up with it. For the same reason, Cousin Hattie—really First Cousin Hattie once removed, according to the strict way in which the Stirlings tabulated relationship—a tall, thin lady who admitted she had a sensitive disposition, would describe minutely the tortures of her neuritis. And Isla, the wonder girl of the whole Stirling clan, who had everything Elara had not—beauty, popularity, love,—would show off her beauty and presume on her popularity and flaunt her diamond insignia of love in Elara’s dazzled, envious eyes.\n\nThere would be none of all this today. And there would be no packing up of teaspoons. The packing up was always left for Elara and Cousin Thistle. And once, six years ago, a silver teaspoon from Aunt Juniper’s wedding set had been lost. Elara never heard the last of that silver teaspoon. Its ghost appeared Banquo-like at every subsequent family feast.\n\nOh, yes, Elara knew exactly what the picnic would be like and she blessed the rain that had saved her from it. There would be no picnic this year. If Aunt Juniper could not celebrate on the sacred day itself she would have no celebration at all. Thank whatever gods there were for that.\n\nSince there would be no picnic, Elara made up her mind that, if the rain held up in the afternoon, she would go up to the library and get another of Ian Rowlston’s books. Elara was never allowed to read novels, but Ian Rowlston’s books were not novels. They were “nature books”—so the librarian told Mrs. Octavia Finch—“all about the woods and birds and bugs and things like that, you know.” So Elara was allowed to read them—under protest, for it was only too evident that she enjoyed them too much. It was permissible, even laudable, to read to improve your mind and your religion, but a book that was enjoyable was dangerous. Elara did not know whether her mind was being improved or not; but she felt vaguely that if she had come across Ian Rowlston’s books years ago life might have been a different thing for her. They seemed to her to yield glimpses of a world into which she might once have entered, though the door was forever barred to her now. It was only within the last year that Ian Rowlston’s books had been in the Deerwood library, though the librarian told Elara that he had been a well-known writer for several years.\n\n“Where does he live?” Elara had asked.\n\n“Nobody knows. From his books he must be a Canadian, but no more information can be had. His publishers won’t say a word. Quite likely Ian Rowlston is a nom de plume. His books are so popular we can’t keep them in at all, though I really can’t see what people find in them to rave over.”\n\n“I think they’re wonderful,” said Elara, timidly.\n\n“Oh—well—” Miss Primrose smiled in a patronising fashion that relegated Elara’s opinions to limbo, “I can’t say I care much for bugs myself. But certainly Foster seems to know all there is to know about them.”\n\nElara didn’t know whether she cared much for bugs either. It was not Ian Rowlston’s uncanny knowledge of wild creatures and insect life that enthralled her. She could hardly say what it was—some tantalising lure of a mystery never revealed—some hint of a great secret just a little further on—some faint, elusive echo of lovely, forgotten things—Ian Rowlston’s magic was indefinable.\n\nYes, she would get a new Foster book. It was a month since she had Thistle Harvest, so surely Matron could not object. Elara had read it four times—she knew whole passages off by heart.\n\nAnd—she almost thought she would go and see Dr. Larkin about that queer pain around the heart. It had come rather often lately, and the palpitations were becoming annoying, not to speak of an occasional dizzy moment and a queer shortness of breath. But could she go to see him without telling any one? It was a most daring thought. None of the Stirlings ever consulted a doctor without holding a family council and getting Uncle Vernon’ approval. Then, they went to Dr. Silas Reeves of Port Lawrence, who had married Second Cousin Miranda Finch.\n\nBut Elara disliked Dr. Silas Reeves. And, besides, she could not get to Port Lawrence, fifteen miles away, without being taken there. She did not want any one to know about her heart. There would be such a fuss made and every member of the family would come down and talk it over and advise her and caution her and warn her and tell her horrible tales of great-aunts and cousins forty times removed who had been “just like that” and “dropped dead without a moment’s warning, my dear.”\n\nAunt Maude would remember that she had always said El looked like a girl who would have heart trouble—“so pinched and peaked always”; and Uncle Jasper would take it as a personal insult, when “no Stirling ever had heart disease before”; and Lydia would forebode in perfectly audible asides that “poor, dear little El isn’t long for this world, I’m afraid”; and Cousin Hattie would say, “Why, my heart has been like that for years,” in a tone that implied no one else had any business even to have a heart; and Isla—Isla would merely look beautiful and superior and disgustingly healthy, as if to say, “Why all this fuss over a faded superfluity like El when you have me?”\n\nElara felt that she couldn’t tell anybody unless she had to. She felt quite sure there was nothing at all seriously wrong with her heart and no need of all the pother that would ensue if she mentioned it. She would just slip up quietly and see Dr. Larkin that very day. As for his bill, she had the two hundred dollars that her father had put in the bank for her the day she was born. She was never allowed to use even the interest of this, but she would secretly take out enough to pay Dr. Larkin.\n\nDr. Larkin was a gruff, outspoken, absent-minded old fellow, but he was a recognised authority on heart disease, even if he were only a general practitioner in out-of-the-world Deerwood. Dr. Larkin was over seventy and there had been rumours that he meant to retire soon. None of the Stirling clan had ever gone to him since he had told Cousin Hattie, ten years before, that her neuritis was all imaginary and that she enjoyed it. You couldn’t patronise a doctor who insulted your first-cousin-once-removed like that—not to mention that he was a Presbyterian when all the Stirlings went to the Anglican church. But Elara, between the devil of disloyalty to clan and the deep sea of fuss and clatter and advice, thought she would take a chance with the devil.\n\nCHAPTER II\nWhen Cousin Thistle knocked at her door, Elara knew it was half-past seven and she must get up. As long as she could remember, Cousin Thistle had knocked at her door at half-past seven. Cousin Thistle and Mrs. Octavia Finch had been up since seven, but Elara was allowed to lie abed half an hour longer because of a family tradition that she was delicate. Elara got up, though she hated getting up more this morning than ever she had before. What was there to get up for? Another dreary day like all the days that had preceded it, full of meaningless little tasks, joyless and unimportant, that benefited nobody. But if she did not get up at once she would not be ready for breakfast at eight o’clock. Hard and fast times for meals were the rule in Mrs. Finch’s household. Breakfast at eight, dinner at one, supper at six, year in and year out. No excuses for being late were ever tolerated. So up Elara got, shivering.\n\nThe room was bitterly cold with the raw, penetrating chill of a wet May morning. The house would be cold all day. It was one of Mrs. Octavia’s rules that no fires were necessary after the twenty-fourth of May. Meals were cooked on the little oil-stove in the back porch. And though May might be icy and October frost-bitten, no fires were lighted until the twenty-first of October by the calendar. On the twenty-first of October Mrs. Octavia began cooking over the kitchen range and lighted a fire in the sitting-room stove in the evenings. It was whispered about in the connection that the late Gregory Finch had caught the cold which resulted in his death during Elara’s first year of life because Mrs. Octavia would not have a fire on the twentieth of October. She lighted it the next day—but that was a day too late for Gregory Finch.\n\nElara took off and hung up in the closet her nightdress of coarse, unbleached cotton, with high neck and long, tight sleeves. She put on undergarments of a similar nature, a dress of brown gingham, thick, black stockings and rubber-heeled boots. Of late years she had fallen into the habit of doing her hair with the shade of the window by the looking-glass pulled down. The lines on her face did not show so plainly then. But this morning she jerked the shade to the very top and looked at herself in the leprous mirror with a passionate determination to see herself as the world saw her.\n\nThe result was rather dreadful. Even a beauty would have found that harsh, unsoftened side-light trying. Elara saw straight black hair, short and thin, always lustreless despite the fact that she gave it one hundred strokes of the brush, neither more nor less, every night of her life and faithfully rubbed Hawke’s Hair Vigor into the roots, more lustreless than ever in its morning roughness; fine, straight, black brows; a nose she had always felt was much too small even for her small, three-cornered, white face; a small, pale mouth that always fell open a trifle over little, pointed white teeth; a figure thin and flat-breasted, rather below the average height. She had somehow escaped the family high cheek-bones, and her dark-brown eyes, too soft and shadowy to be black, had a slant that was almost Oriental. Apart from her eyes she was neither pretty nor ugly—just insignificant-looking, she concluded bitterly. How plain the lines around her eyes and mouth were in that merciless light! And never had her narrow, white face looked so narrow and so white.\n\nShe did her hair in a pompadour. Pompadours had long gone out of fashion, but they had been in when Elara first put her hair up and Aunt Juniper had decided that she must always wear her hair so.\n\n“It is the only way that becomes you. Your face is so small that you must add height to it by a pompadour effect,” said Aunt Juniper, who always enunciated commonplaces as if uttering profound and important truths.\n\nElara had hankered to do her hair pulled low on her forehead, with puffs above the ears, as Isla was wearing hers. But Aunt Juniper’s dictum had such an effect on her that she never dared change her style of hairdressing again. But then, there were so many things Elara never dared do.\n\nAll her life she had been afraid of something, she thought bitterly. From the very dawn of recollection, when she had been so horribly afraid of the big black bear that lived, so Cousin Thistle told her, in the closet under the stairs.\n\n“And I always will be—I know it—I can’t help it. I don’t know what it would be like not to be afraid of something.”\n\nAfraid of her mother’s sulky fits—afraid of offending Uncle Eldridge—afraid of becoming a target for Aunt Juniper’s contempt—afraid of Aunt Maude’s biting comments—afraid of Uncle Vernon’ disapproval—afraid of offending the whole clan’s opinions and prejudices—afraid of not keeping up appearances—afraid to say what she really thought of anything—afraid of poverty in her old age. Fear—fear—fear—she could never escape from it. It bound her and enmeshed her like a spider’s web of steel. Only in her Blue Castle could she find temporary release. And this morning Elara could not believe she had a Blue Castle. She would never be able to find it again. Twenty-nine, unmarried, undesired—what had she to do with the fairy-like chatelaine of the Blue Castle? She would cut such childish nonsense out of her life forever and face reality unflinchingly.\n\nShe turned from her unfriendly mirror and looked out. The ugliness of the view always struck her like a blow; the ragged fence, the tumble-down old carriage-shop in the next lot, plastered with crude, violently coloured advertisements; the grimy railway station beyond, with the awful derelicts that were always hanging around it even at this early hour. In the pouring rain everything looked worse than usual, especially the beastly advertisement, “Keep that schoolgirl complexion.” Elara had kept her schoolgirl complexion. That was just the trouble. There was not a gleam of beauty anywhere—“exactly like my life,” thought Elara drearily. Her brief bitterness had passed. She accepted facts as resignedly as she had always accepted them. She was one of the people whom life always passes by. There was no altering that fact.\n\nIn this mood Elara went down to breakfast.\n\nCHAPTER III\nBreakfast was always the same. Oatmeal porridge, which Elara loathed, toast and tea, and one teaspoonful of marmalade. Mrs. Octavia thought two teaspoonfuls extravagant—but that did not matter to Elara, who hated marmalade, too. The chilly, gloomy little dining-room was chillier and gloomier than usual; the rain streamed down outside the window; departed Stirlings, in atrocious, gilt frames, wider than the pictures, glowered down from the walls. And yet Cousin Thistle wished Elara many happy returns of the day!\n\n“Sit up straight, El,” was all her mother said.\n\nElara sat up straight. She talked to her mother and Cousin Thistle of the things they always talked of. She never wondered what would happen if she tried to talk of something else. She knew. Therefore she never did it.\n\nMrs. Octavia was offended with Providence for sending a rainy day when she wanted to go to a picnic, so she ate her breakfast in a sulky silence for which Elara was rather grateful. But Christine Thistle whined endlessly on as usual, complaining about everything—the weather, the leak in the pantry, the price of oatmeal and butter—Elara felt at once she had buttered her toast too lavishly—the epidemic of mumps in Deerwood.\n\n“El will be sure to ketch them,” she foreboded.\n\n“El must not go where she is likely to catch mumps,” said Mrs. Octavia shortly.\n\nElara had never had mumps—or whooping cough—or chicken-pox—or measles—or anything she should have had—nothing but horrible colds every winter. El’ winter colds were a sort of tradition in the family. Nothing, it seemed, could prevent her from catching them. Mrs. Octavia and Cousin Thistle did their heroic best. One winter they kept Elara housed up from November to May, in the warm sitting-room. She was not even allowed to go to church. And Elara took cold after cold and ended up with bronchitis in June.\n\n“None of my family were ever like that,” said Mrs. Octavia, implying that it must be a Stirling tendency.\n\n“The Stirlings seldom take colds,” said Cousin Thistle resentfully. She had been a Stirling.\n\n“I think,” said Mrs. Octavia, “that if a person makes up her mind not to have colds she will not have colds.”\n\nSo that was the trouble. It was all Elara’s own fault.\n\nBut on this particular morning Elara’s unbearable grievance was that she was called El. She had endured it for twenty-nine years, and all at once she felt she could not endure it any longer. Her full name was Elara Jane. Elara Jane was rather terrible, but she liked Elara, with its odd, out-land tang. It was always a wonder to Elara that the Stirlings had allowed her to be so christened. She had been told that her maternal grandfather, old Amos Wansbarra, had chosen the name for her. Her father had tacked on the Jane by way of civilising it, and the whole connection got out of the difficulty by nicknaming her El. She never got Elara from any one but outsiders.\n\n“Matron,” she said timidly, “would you mind calling me Elara after this? El seems so—so—I don’t like it.”\n\nMrs. Octavia looked at her daughter in astonishment. She wore glasses with enormously strong lenses that gave her eyes a peculiarly disagreeable appearance.\n\n“What is the matter with El?”\n\n“It—seems so childish,” faltered Elara.\n\n“Oh!” Mrs. Octavia had been a Wansbarra and the Wansbarra smile was not an asset. “I see. Well, it should suit you then. You are childish enough in all conscience, my dear child.”\n\n“I am twenty-nine,” said the dear child desperately.\n\n“I wouldn’t proclaim it from the house-tops if I were you, dear,” said Mrs. Octavia. “Twenty-nine! I had been married nine years when I was twenty-nine.”\n\n“I was married at seventeen,” said Cousin Thistle proudly.\n\nElara looked at them furtively. Mrs. Octavia, except for those terrible glasses and the hooked nose that made her look more like a parrot than a parrot itself could look, was not ill-looking. At twenty she might have been quite pretty. But Cousin Thistle! And yet Christine Thistle had once been desirable in some man’s eyes. Elara felt that Cousin Thistle, with her broad, flat, wrinkled face, a mole right on the end of her dumpy nose, bristling hairs on her chin, wrinkled yellow neck, pale, protruding eyes, and thin, puckered mouth, had yet this advantage over her—this right to look down on her. And even yet Cousin Thistle was necessary to Mrs. Octavia. Elara wondered pitifully what it would be like to be wanted by some one—needed by some one. No one in the whole world needed her, or would miss anything from life if she dropped suddenly out of it. She was a disappointment to her mother. No one loved her. She had never so much as had a girl friend.\n\n“I haven’t even a gift for friendship,” she had once admitted to herself pitifully.\n\n“El, you haven’t eaten your crusts,” said Mrs. Octavia rebukingly.\n\nIt rained all the forenoon without cessation. Elara pieced a quilt. Elara hated piecing quilts. And there was no need of it. The house was full of quilts. There were three big chests, packed with quilts, in the attic. Mrs. Octavia had begun storing away quilts when Elara was seventeen and she kept on storing them, though it did not seem likely that Elara would ever need them. But Elara must be at work and fancy work materials were too expensive. Idleness was a cardinal sin in the Stirling household. When Elara had been a child she had been made to write down every night, in a small, hated, black notebook, all the minutes she had spent in idleness that day. On Sundays her mother made her tot them up and pray over them.\n\nOn this particular forenoon of this day of destiny Elara spent only ten minutes in idleness. At least, Mrs. Octavia and Cousin Thistle would have called it idleness. She went to her room to get a better thimble and she opened Thistle Harvest guiltily at random.\n\n“The woods are so human,” wrote Ian Rowlston, “that to know them one must live with them. An occasional saunter through them, keeping to the well-trodden paths, will never admit us to their intimacy. If we wish to be friends we must seek them out and win them by frequent, reverent visits at all hours; by morning, by noon, and by night; and at all seasons, in spring, in summer, in autumn, in winter. Otherwise we can never really know them and any pretence we may make to the contrary will never impose on them. They have their own effective way of keeping aliens at a distance and shutting their hearts to mere casual sightseers. It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive except sheer love of them; they will find us out at once and hide all their sweet, old-world secrets from us. But if they know we come to them because we love them they will be very kind to us and give us such treasures of beauty and delight as are not bought or sold in any market-place. For the woods, when they give at all, give unstintedly and hold nothing back from their true worshippers. We must go to them lovingly, humbly, patiently, watchfully, and we shall learn what poignant loveliness lurks in the wild places and silent intervals, lying under starshine and sunset, what cadences of unearthly music are harped on aged pine boughs or crooned in copses of fir, what delicate savours exhale from mosses and ferns in sunny corners or on damp brooklands, what dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt them. Then the immortal heart of the woods will beat against ours and its subtle life will steal into our veins and make us its own forever, so that no matter where we go or how widely we wander we shall yet be drawn back to the forest to find our most enduring kinship.”\n\n“El,” called her mother from the hall below, “what are you doing all by yourself in that room?”\n\nElara dropped Thistle Harvest like a hot coal and fled downstairs to her patches; but she felt the strange exhilaration of spirit that always came momentarily to her when she dipped into one of Ian Rowlston’s books. Elara did not know much about woods—except the haunted groves of oak and pine around her Blue Castle. But she had always secretly hankered after them and a Foster book about woods was the next best thing to the woods themselves.\n\nAt noon it stopped raining, but the sun did not come out until three. Then Elara timidly said she thought she would go uptown.\n\n“What do you want to go uptown for?” demanded her mother.\n\n“I want to get a book from the library.”\n\n“You got a book from the library only last week.”\n\n“No, it was four weeks.”\n\n“Four weeks. Nonsense!”\n\n“Really it was, Matron.”\n\n“You are mistaken. It cannot possibly have been more than two weeks. I dislike contradiction. And I do not see what you want to get a book for, anyhow. You waste too much time reading.”\n\n“Of what value is my time?” asked Elara bitterly.\n\n“El! Don’t speak in that tone to me.”\n\n“We need some tea,” said Cousin Thistle. “She might go and get that if she wants a walk—though this damp weather is bad for colds.”\n\nThey argued the matter for ten minutes longer and finally Mrs. Octavia agreed rather grudgingly that Elara might go.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n“Got your rubbers on?” called Cousin Thistle, as Elara left the house.\n\nChristine Thistle had never once forgotten to ask that question when Elara went out on a damp day.\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Have you got your flannel petticoat on?” asked Mrs. Octavia.\n\n“No.”\n\n“El, I really do not understand you. Do you want to catch your death of cold again?” Her voice implied that Elara had died of a cold several times already. “Go upstairs this minute and put it on!”\n\n“Matron, I don’t need a flannel petticoat. My sateen one is warm enough.”\n\n“El, remember you had bronchitis two years ago. Go and do as you are told!”\n\nElara went, though nobody will ever know just how near she came to hurling the rubber-plant into the street before she went. She hated that grey flannel petticoat more than any other garment she owned. Isla never had to wear flannel petticoats. Isla wore ruffled silk and sheer lawn and filmy laced flounces. But Isla’s father had “married money” and Isla never had bronchitis. So there you were.\n\n“Are you sure you didn’t leave the soap in the water?” demanded Mrs. Octavia. But Elara was gone. She turned at the corner and looked back down the ugly, prim, respectable street where she lived. The Stirling house was the ugliest on it—more like a red brick box than anything else. Too high for its breadth, and made still higher by a bulbous glass cupola on top. About it was the desolate, barren peace of an old house whose life is lived.\n\nThere was a very pretty little house, with leaded casements and dubbed gables, just around the corner—a new house, one of those houses you love the minute you see them. Duncan Withers had built it for his bride. He was to be married to Gwenyth Harper in June. The little house, it was said, was furnished from attic to cellar, in complete readiness for its mistress.\n\n“I don’t envy Jennie the man,” thought Elara sincerely—Duncan Withers was not one of her many ideals—“but I do envy her the house. It’s such a nice young house. Oh, if I could only have a house of my own—ever so poor, so tiny—but my own! But then,” she added bitterly, “there is no use in yowling for the moon when you can’t even get a tallow candle.”\n\nIn dreamland nothing would do Elara but a castle of pale sapphire. In real life she would have been fully satisfied with a little house of her own. She envied Gwenyth Harper more fiercely than ever today. Jennie was not so much better looking than she was, and not so very much younger. Yet she was to have this delightful house. And the nicest little Wedgwood teacups—Elara had seen them; an open fireplace, and monogrammed linen; hemstitched tablecloths, and china-closets. Why did everything come to some girls and nothing to others? It wasn’t fair.\n\nElara was once more seething with rebellion as she walked along, a prim, dowdy little figure in her shabby raincoat and three-year-old hat, splashed occasionally by the mud of a passing motor with its insulting shrieks. Motors were still rather a novelty in Deerwood, though they were common in Port Lawrence, and most of the summer residents up at Muskoka had them. In Deerwood only some of the smart set had them; for even Deerwood was divided into sets. There was the smart set—the intellectual set—the old-family set—of which the Stirlings were members—the common run, and a few pariahs. Not one of the Stirling clan had as yet condescended to a motor, though Isla was teasing her father to have one. Elara had never even been in a motorcar. But she did not hanker after this. In truth, she felt rather afraid of motorcars, especially at night. They seemed to be too much like big purring beasts that might turn and crush you—or make some terrible savage leap somewhere. On the steep mountain trails around her Blue Castle only gaily caparisoned steeds might proudly pace; in real life Elara would have been quite contented to drive in a buggy behind a nice horse. She got a buggy drive only when some uncle or cousin remembered to fling her “a chance,” like a bone to a dog.\n\nCHAPTER V\nOf course she must buy the tea in Uncle Eldridge’s grocery-store. To buy it anywhere else was un",

    "context": "sasterous car journey and Leo’s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Leo’s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Twig squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Eli was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Leo, and Isla were planning to visit Griff on Saturday morning. Eli, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by Dorian Ash, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.\n\n“Whassamatter?” said Eli groggily.\n\n“Quidditch practice!” said Ash. “Come on!”\n\nEli squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn’t understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making.\n\n“Dorian,” Eli croaked. “It’s the crack of dawn.”\n\n“Exactly,” said Ash. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. “It’s part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let’s go,” said Ash heartily. “None of the other teams have started training yet; we’re going to be first off the mark this year —”\n\nYawning and shivering slightly, Eli climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes.\n\n“Good man,” said Ash. “Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.”\n\nWhen he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Eli scribbled a note to Leo explaining where he’d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Ripple came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand.\n\n“I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Eli! Look what I’ve got here! I’ve had it developed, I wanted to show you —”\n\nEli looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose.\n\nA moving, black-and-white Bright was tugging hard on an arm Eli recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. As Eli watched, Bright gave up and slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture.\n\n“Will you sign it?” said Colin eagerly.\n\n“No,” said Eli flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted. “Sorry, Colin, I’m in a hurry — Quidditch practice —”\n\nHe climbed through the portrait hole.\n\n“Oh, wow! Wait for me! I’ve never watched a Quidditch game before!”\n\nColin scrambled through the hole after him.\n\n“It’ll be really boring,” Eli said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with excitement.\n\n“You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren’t you, Eli? Weren’t you?” said Colin, trotting alongside him. “You must be brilliant. I’ve never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the best one there is?”\n\nEli didn’t know how to get rid of him. It was like having an extremely talkative shadow.\n\n“I don’t really understand Quidditch,” said Colin breathlessly. “Is it true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms?”\n\n“Yes,” said Eli heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch. “They’re called Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Felix and Aiden Brunswick are the Gryffindor Beaters.”\n\n“And what are the other balls for?” Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Eli.\n\n“Well, the Quaffle — that’s the biggish red one — is the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch — they’re three long poles with hoops on the end.”\n\n“And the fourth ball —”\n\n“— is the Golden Snitch,” said Eli, “and it’s very small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that’s what the Seeker’s got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn’t end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever team’s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points.”\n\n“And you’re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren’t you?” said Colin in awe.\n\n“Yes,” said Eli as they left the castle and started across the dew-drenched grass. “And there’s the Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That’s it, really.”\n\nBut Colin didn’t stop questioning Eli all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Eli only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, “I’ll go and get a good seat, Eli!” and hurried off to the stands.\n\nThe rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Ash was the only person who looked truly awake. Felix and Aiden Brunswick were sitting, puffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year Alicia Windy, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Starr and Angelica Monroe, were yawning side by side opposite them.\n\n“There you are, Eli, what kept you?” said Ash briskly. “Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference. …”\n\nAsh was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in different-colored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Ash launched into a speech about his new tactics, Felix Brunswick’s head drooped right onto Alicia Windy’s shoulder and he began to snore.\n\nThe first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. Eli sank into a stupor as Ash droned on and on.\n\n“So,” said Ash, at long last, jerking Eli from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. “Is that clear? Any questions?”\n\n“I’ve got a question, Dorian,” said Aiden, who had woken with a start. “Why couldn’t you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?”\n\nAsh wasn’t pleased.\n\n“Now, listen here, you lot,” he said, glowering at them all. “We should have won the Quidditch Cup last year. We’re easily the best team. But unfortunately — owing to circumstances beyond our control —”\n\nEli shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years.\n\nAsh took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him.\n\n“So this year, we train harder than ever before. … Okay, let’s go and put our new theories into practice!” Ash shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still yawning, his team followed.\n\nThey had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Eli walked onto the field, he saw Leo and Isla sitting in the stands.\n\n“Aren’t you finished yet?” called Leo incredulously.\n\n“Haven’t even started,” said Eli, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Leo and Isla had brought out of the Great Hall. “Ash’s been teaching us new moves.”\n\nHe mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Ash’s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Felix and Aiden.\n\n“What’s that funny clicking noise?” called Felix as they hurtled around the corner.\n\nEli looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium.\n\n“Look this way, Eli! This way!” he cried shrilly.\n\n“Who’s that?” said Felix.\n\n“No idea,” Eli lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin.\n\n“What’s going on?” said Ash, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them. “Why’s that first year taking pictures? I don’t like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.”\n\n“He’s in Gryffindor,” said Eli quickly.\n\n“And the Slytherins don’t need a spy, Dorian,” said Aiden.\n\n“What makes you say that?” said Ash testily.\n\n“Because they’re here in person,” said Aiden, pointing.\n\nSeveral people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands.\n\n“I don’t believe it!” Ash hissed in outrage. “I booked the field for today! We’ll see about this!”\n\nAsh shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Eli, Felix, and Aiden followed.\n\n“Flint!” Ash bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. “This is our practice time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!”\n\nMarcus Flint was even larger than Ash. He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, “Plenty of room for all of us, Ash.”\n\nAngelica, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man.\n\n“But I booked the field!” said Ash, positively spitting with rage. “I booked it!”\n\n“Ah,” said Flint. “But I’ve got a specially signed note here from Professor Thorne. ‘I, Professor S. Thorne, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker.’ ”\n\n“You’ve got a new Seeker?” said Ash, distracted. “Where?”\n\nAnd from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Jasper Mortem.\n\n“Aren’t you Caspian Mortem’s son?” said Felix, looking at Mortem with dislike.\n\n“Funny you should mention Jasper’s father,” said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. “Let me show you the generous gift he’s made to the Slytherin team.”\n\nAll seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors’ noses in the early morning sun.\n\n“Very latest model. Only came out last month,” said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. “I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps” — he smiled nastily at Felix and Aiden, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives — “sweeps the board with them.”\n\nNone of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Mortem was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.\n\n“Oh, look,” said Flint. “A field invasion.”\n\nLeo and Isla were crossing the grass to see what was going on.\n\n“What’s happening?” Leo asked Eli. “Why aren’t you playing? And what’s he doing here?”\n\nHe was looking at Mortem, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.\n\n“I’m the new Slytherin Seeker, Brunswick,” said Mortem, smugly. “Everyone’s just been admiring the brooms my father’s bought our team.”\n\nLeo gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him.\n\n“Good, aren’t they?” said Mortem smoothly. “But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them.”\n\nThe Slytherin team howled with laughter.\n\n“At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,” said Isla sharply. “They got in on pure talent.”\n\nThe smug look on Mortem’s face flickered.\n\n“No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,” he spat.\n\nEli knew at once that Mortem had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Mortem to stop Felix and Aiden jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, “How dare you!”, and Leo plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll pay for that one, Mortem!” and pointed it furiously under Flint’s arm at Mortem’s face.\n\nA loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Leo’s wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass.\n\n“Leo! Leo! Are you all right?” squealed Isla.\n\nLeo opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.\n\nThe Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Mortem was on all fours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were gathered around Leo, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch him.\n\n“We’d better get him to Griff’s, it’s nearest,” said Eli to Isla, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Leo up by the arms.\n\n“What happened, Eli? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure him, can’t you?” Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field. Leo gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front.\n\n“Oooh,” said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. “Can you hold him still, Eli?”\n\n“Get out of the way, Colin!” said Eli angrily. He and Isla supported Leo out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest.\n\n“Nearly there, Leo,” said Isla as the gamekeeper’s cabin came into view. “You’ll be all right in a minute — almost there —”\n\nThey were within twenty feet of Griff’s house when the front door opened, but it wasn’t Griff who emerged. Julian Bright, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.\n\n“Quick, behind here,” Eli hissed, dragging Leo behind a nearby bush. Isla followed, somewhat reluctantly.\n\n“It’s a simple matter if you know what you’re doing!” Bright was saying loudly to Griff. “If you need help, you know where I am! I’ll let you have a copy of my book. I’m surprised you haven’t already got one — I’ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!” And he strode away toward the castle.\n\nEli waited until Bright was out of sight, then pulled Leo out of the bush and up to Griff’s front door. They knocked urgently.\n\nGriff appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression brightened when he saw who it was.\n\n“Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me — come in, come in — thought you mighta bin Professor Bright back again —”\n\nEli and Isla supported Leo over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other. Griff didn’t seem perturbed by Leo’s slug problem, which Eli hastily explained as he lowered Leo into a chair.\n\n“Better out than in,” he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of him. “Get ’em all up, Leo.”\n\n“I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it to stop,” said Isla anxiously, watching Leo bend over the basin. “That’s a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand —”\n\nGriff was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Eli.\n\n“What did Bright want with you, Griff?” Eli asked, scratching Fang’s ears.\n\n“Givin’ me advice on gettin’ kelpies out of a well,” growled Griff, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. “Like I don’ know. An’ bangin’ on about some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I’ll eat my kettle.”\n\nIt was most unlike Griff to criticize a Hogwarts teacher, and Eli looked at him in surprise. Isla, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, “I think you’re being a bit unfair. Professor Starling obviously thought he was the best man for the job —”\n\n“He was the on’y man for the job,” said Griff, offering them a plate of treacle toffee, while Leo coughed squelchily into his basin. “An’ I mean the on’y one. Gettin’ very difficult ter find anyone fer the Dark Arts job. People aren’t too keen ter take it on, see. They’re startin’ ter think it’s jinxed. No one’s lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,” said Griff, jerking his head at Leo. “Who was he tryin’ ter curse?”\n\n“Mortem called Isla something — it must’ve been really bad, because everyone went wild.”\n\n“It was bad,” said Leo hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty. “Mortem called her ‘Mudblood,’ Griff —”\n\nLeo dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Griff looked outraged.\n\n“He didn’!” he growled at Isla.\n\n“He did,” she said. “But I don’t know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course —”\n\n“It’s about the most insulting thing he could think of,” gasped Leo, coming back up. “Mudblood’s a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born — you know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards — like Mortem’s family — who think they’re better than everyone else because they’re what people call pure-blood.” He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin and continued, “I mean, the rest of us know it doesn’t make any difference at all. Look at Nolan Broadfoot — he’s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.”\n\n“An’ they haven’t invented a spell our Isla can’ do,” said Griff proudly, making Isla go a brilliant shade of magenta.\n\n“It’s a disgusting thing to call someone,” said Leo, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. “Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It’s ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn’t married Muggles we’d’ve died out.”\n\nHe retched and ducked out of sight again.\n\n“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Leo,” said Griff loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. “Bu’ maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. ’Spect Caspian Mortem would’ve come marchin’ up ter school if yeh’d cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble.”\n\nEli would have pointed out that trouble didn’t come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn’t; Griff’s treacle toffee had cemented his jaws together.\n\n“Eli,” said Griff abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. “Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I’ve heard you’ve bin givin’ out signed photos. How come I haven’t got one?”\n\nFurious, Eli wrenched his teeth apart.\n\n“I have not been giving out signed photos,” he said hotly. “If Bright’s still spreading that around —”\n\nBut then he saw that Griff was laughing.\n\n“I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patting Eli genially on the back and sending him face first into the table. “I knew yeh hadn’t really. I told Bright yeh didn’ need teh. Yer more famous than him without tryin’.”\n\n“Bet he didn’t like that,” said Eli, sitting up and rubbing his chin.\n\n“Don’ think he did,” said Griff, his eyes twinkling. “An’ then I told him I’d never read one o’ his books an’ he decided ter go. Treacle toffee, Leo?” he added as Leo reappeared.\n\n“No thanks,” said Leo weakly. “Better not risk it.”\n\n“Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said Griff as Eli and Isla finished the last of their tea.\n\nIn the small vegetable patch behind Griff’s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Eli had ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder.\n\n“Gettin’ on well, aren’t they?” said Griff happily. “Fer the Halloween feast … should be big enough by then.”\n\n“What’ve you been feeding them?” said Eli.\n\nGriff looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.\n\n“Well, I’ve bin givin’ them — you know — a bit o’ help —”\n\nEli noticed Griff’s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin. Eli had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression that Griff’s old school wand was concealed inside it. Griff wasn’t supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Eli had never found out why — any mention of the matter and Griff would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed.\n\n“An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?” said Isla, halfway between disapproval and amusement. “Well, you’ve done a good job on them.”\n\n“That’s what yer little sister said,” said Griff, nodding at Leo. “Met her jus’ yesterday.” Griff looked sideways at Eli, his beard twitching. “Said she was jus’ lookin’ round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin’ she might run inter someone else at my house.” He winked at Eli. “If yeh ask me, she wouldn’ say no ter a signed —”\n\n“Oh, shut up,” said Eli. Leo snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs.\n\n“Watch it!” Griff roared, pulling Leo away from his precious pumpkins.\n\nIt was nearly lunchtime and as Eli had only had one bit of treacle toffee since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Griff and walked back up to the castle, Leo hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.\n\nThey had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, “There you are, Ember — Brunswick.” Professor Falconer was walking toward them, looking stern. “You will both do your detentions this evening.”\n\n“What’re we doing, Professor?” said Leo, nervously suppressing a burp.\n\n“You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Acheron,” said Professor Falconer. “And no magic, Brunswick — elbow grease.”\n\nLeo gulped. Argus Acheron, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the school.\n\n“And you, Ember, will be helping Professor Bright answer his fan mail,” said Professor Falconer.\n\n“Oh n — Professor, can’t I go and do the trophy room, too?” said Eli desperately.\n\n“Certainly not,” said Professor Falconer, raising her eyebrows. “Professor Bright requested you particularly. Eight o’clock sharp, both of you.”\n\nEli and Leo slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Isla behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression. Eli didn’t enjoy his shepherd’s pie as much as he’d thought. Both he and Leo felt they’d got the worse deal.\n\n“Acheron’ll have me there all night,” said Leo heavily. “No magic! There must be about a hundred cups in that room. I’m no good at Muggle cleaning.”\n\n“I’d swap anytime,” said Eli hollowly. “I’ve had loads of practice with the Powells. Answering Bright’s fan mail … he’ll be a nightmare. …”\n\nSaturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and Eli was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Bright’s office. He gritted his teeth and knocked.\n\nThe door flew open at once. Bright beamed down at him.\n\n“Ah, here’s the scalawag!” he said. “Come in, Eli, come in —”\n\nShining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Bright. He had even signed a few of them. Another large pile lay on his desk.\n\n“You can address the envelopes!” Bright told Eli, as though this was a huge treat. “This first one’s to Gladys Bumble, bless her — huge fan of mine —”\n\nThe minutes snailed by. Eli let Bright’s voice wash over him, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and “Right” and “Yeah.” Now and then he caught a phrase like, “Fame’s a fickle friend, Eli,” or “Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.”\n\nThe candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Bright watching him. Eli moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Birch’s address. It must be nearly time to leave, Eli thought miserably, please let it be nearly time. …\n\nAnd then he heard something — something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Bright’s prattle about his fans.\n\nIt was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom.\n\n“Come … come to me. … Let me rip you. … Let me tear you. … Let me kill you. …”\n\nEli gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Birch’s street.\n\n“What?” he said loudly.\n\n“I know!” said Bright. “Six solid months at the top of the best-seller list! Broke all records!”\n\n“No,” said Eli frantically. “That voice!”\n\n“Sorry?” said Bright, looking puzzled. “What voice?”\n\n“That — that voice that said — didn’t you hear it?”\n\nBright was looking at Eli in high astonishment.\n\n“What are you talking about, Eli? Perhaps you’re getting a little drowsy? Great Scott — look at the time! “We’ve been here nearly four hours! I’d never have believed it — the time’s flown, hasn’t it?”\n\nEli didn’t answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Bright telling him he mustn’t expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Eli left.\n\nIt was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty. Eli went straight up to the dormitory. Leo wasn’t back yet. Eli pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Leo arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room.\n\n“My muscles have all seized up,” he groaned, sinking on his bed. “Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch Cup before he was satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off. … How was it with Bright?”\n\nKeeping his voice low so as not to wake Nolan, Dean, and Liam, Eli told Leo exactly what he had heard.\n\n“And Bright said he couldn’t hear it?” said Leo. Eli could see him frowning in the moonlight. “D’you think he was lying? But I don’t get it — even someone invisible would’ve had to open the door.”\n\n“I know,” said Eli, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him. “I don’t get it either.”\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\n\nThe Deathday Party\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Fern, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup Potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Lila Brunswick, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Evan. The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire.\n\nRaindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Griff’s pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Dorian Ash’s enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Eli was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud. Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn’t been a happy practice session. Felix and Aiden, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles.\n\nAs Eli squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Barely Headless Nate, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, “… don’t fulfill their requirements … half an inch, if that …”\n\n“Hello, Nick,” said Eli.\n\n“Hello, hello,” said Barely Headless Nate, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Eli could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside.\n\n“You look troubled, young Ember,” said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.\n\n“So do you,” said Eli.\n\n“Ah,” Barely Headless Nate waved an elegant hand, “a matter of no importance. … It’s not as though I really wanted to join. … Thought I’d apply, but apparently I ‘don’t fulfill requirements’ —”\n\nIn spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.\n\n“But you would think, wouldn’t you,” he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket, “that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?”\n\n“Oh — yes,” said Eli, who was obviously supposed to agree.\n\n“I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. However —” Barely Headless Nate shook his letter open and read furiously:\n\n\n\n“ ‘We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Reginald Daring-More.’ ”\n\n\n\nFuming, Barely Headless Nate stuffed the letter away.\n\n“Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Eli! Most people would think that’s good and beheaded, but oh, no, it’s not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.”\n\nBarely Headless Nate took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, “So — what’s bothering you? Anything I can do?”\n\n“No,” said Eli. “Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly —”\n\nThe rest of Eli’s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Whiskers, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Acheron, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students.\n\n“You’d better get out of here, Eli,” said Nick quickly. “Acheron isn’t in a good mood — he’s got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He’s been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place —”\n\n“Right,” said Eli, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Whiskers, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Acheron burst suddenly through a tapestry to Eli’s right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple.\n\n“Filth!” he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Eli’s Quidditch robes. “Mess and muck everywhere! I’ve had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Ember!”\n\nSo Eli waved a gloomy good-bye to Barely Headless Nate and followed Acheron back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor.\n\nEli had never been inside Acheron’s office before; it was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. Ashen filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, Eli could see that they contained details of every pupil Acheron had ever punished. Felix and Aiden Brunswick had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Acheron’s desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging Starling to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.\n\nAcheron grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment.\n\n“Dung,” he muttered furiously, “great sizzling dragon bogies … frog brains … rat intestines … I’ve had enough of it … make an example … where’s the form … yes …”\n\nHe retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.\n\n“Name … Eli Ember. Crime …”\n\n“It was only a bit of mud!” said Eli.\n\n“It’s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it’s an extra hour scrubbing!” shouted Acheron, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. “Crime … befouling the castle … suggested sentence …”\n\nDabbing at his streaming nose, Acheron squinted unpleasantly at Eli, who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.\n\nBut as Acheron lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle.\n\n“PEEVES!” Acheron roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. “I’ll have you this time, I’ll have you!”\n\nAnd without a backward glance at Eli, Acheron ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Whiskers streaking alongside him.\n\nBanshee was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Eli didn’t much like Banshee, but couldn’t help feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Banshee had done (and it sounded as though he’d wrecked something very big this time) would distract Acheron from Eli.\n\nThinking that he should probably wait for Acheron to come back, Eli sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Acheron wasn’t on his way back, Eli picked up the envelope and read:\n\n\n\n\n\nKWIKSPELL\n\nA Correspondence Course in Beginners’ Magic\n\n\n\n\n\nIntrigued, Eli flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said:\n\n\n\nFeel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork?\n\nThere is an answer!\n\n\n\nKwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method!\n\n\n\nMadam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes:\n\n“I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!”\n\n\n\nWarlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says:\n\n“My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak!\n\nThank you, Kwikspell!”\n\n\n\nFascinated, Eli thumbed through the rest of the envelope’s contents. Why on earth did Acheron want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn’t a proper wizard? Eli was just reading “Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)” when shuffling footsteps outside told him Acheron was coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Eli threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened.\n\nAcheron was looking triumphant.\n\n“That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!” he was saying gleefully to Mrs. Whiskers. “We’ll have Banshee out this time, my sweet —”\n\nHis eyes fell on Eli and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Eli realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.\n\nAcheron’s pasty face went brick red. Eli braced himself for a tidal wave of fury. Acheron hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer.\n\n“Have you — did you read — ?” he sputtered.\n\n“No,” Eli lied quickly.\n\nAcheron’s knobbly hands were twisting together.\n\n“If I thought you’d read my private — not that it’s mine — for a friend — be that as it may — however —”\n\nEli was staring at him, alarmed; Acheron had never looked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn’t help.\n\n“Very well — go — and don’t breathe a word — not that — however, if you didn’t read — go now, I have to write up Banshee’ report — go —”\n\nAmazed at his luck, Eli sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from Acheron’s office without punishment was probably some kind of school record.\n\n“Eli! Eli! Did it work?”\n\nBarely Headless Nate came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Eli could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height.\n\n“I persuaded Banshee to crash it right over Acheron’s office,” said Nick eagerly. “Thought it might distract him —”\n\n“Was that you?” said Eli gratefully. “Yeah, it worked, I didn’t even get detention. Thanks, Nick!”\n\nThey set off up the corridor together. Barely Headless Nate, Eli noticed, was still holding Sir Reginald’s rejection letter.\n\n“I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,” Eli said.\n\nBarely Headless Nate stopped in his tracks and Eli walked right through him. He wished he hadn’t; it was like stepping through an icy shower.\n\n“But there is something you could do for me,” said Nick excitedly. “Eli — would I be asking too much — but no, you wouldn’t want —”\n\n“What is it?” said Eli.\n\n“Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,” said Barely Headless Nate, drawing himself up and looking dignified.\n\n“Oh,” said Eli, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this. “Right.”\n\n“I’m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Brunswick and Miss Hawke would be most welcome, too, of course — but I daresay you’d rather go to the school feast?” He watched Eli on tenterhooks.\n\n“No,” said Eli quickly, “I’ll come —”\n\n“My dear boy! Eli Ember, at my deathday party! And” — he hesitated, looking excited — “do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Reginald how very frightening and impressive you find me?”\n\n“Of — of course,” said Eli.\n\nBarely Headless Nate beamed at him.\n\n\n\n“A deathday party?” said Isla keenly when Eli had changed at last and joined her and Leo in the common room. “I bet there aren’t many living people who can say they’ve been to one of those — it’ll be fascinating!”\n\n“Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?” said Leo, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. “Sounds dead depressing to me. …”\n\nRain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Felix and Aiden Brunswick, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Felix had “rescued” the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people.\n\nEli was at the point of telling Leo and Isla about Acheron and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The sight of Evan bellowing himself hoarse at Felix and Aiden, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander’s mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Acheron and the Kwikspell envelope from Eli’s mind.\n\n\n\nBy the time Halloween arrived, Eli was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Griff’s vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Starling had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.\n\n“A promise is a promise,” Isla reminded Eli bossily. “You said you’d go to the deathday party.”\n\nSo at seven o’clock, Eli, Leo, and Isla walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.\n\nThe passageway leading to Barely Headless Nate’s party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Eli shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.\n\n“Is that supposed to be music?” Leo whispered. They turned a corner and saw Barely Headless Nate standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.\n\n“My dear friends,” he said mournfully. “Welcome, welcome … so pleased you could come. …”\n\nHe swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.\n\nIt was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.\n\n“Shall we have a look around?” Eli suggested, wanting to warm up his feet.\n\n“Careful not to walk through anyone,” said Leo nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Eli wasn’t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts.\n\n“Oh, no,” said Isla, stopping abruptly. “Turn back, turn back, I don’t want to talk to Wailing Wren —”\n\n“Who?” said Eli as they backtracked quickly.\n\n“She haunts one of the toilets in the girls’ bathroom on the first floor,” said Isla.\n\n“She haunts a toilet?”\n\n“Yes. It’s been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it’s awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you —”\n\n“Look, food!” said Leo.\n\nOn the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words,\n\n\n\n\n\nSIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON\n\nDIED 31ST OCTOBER, 1492\n\n\n\n\n\nEli watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon.\n\n“Can you taste it if you walk through it?” Eli asked him.\n\n“Almost,” said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.\n\n“I expect they’ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,” said Isla knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.\n\n“Can we move? I feel sick,” said Leo.\n\nThey had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.\n\n“Hello, Banshee,” said Eli cautiously.\n\nUnlike the ghosts around them, Banshee the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.\n\n“Nibbles?” he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus.\n\n“No thanks,” said Isla.\n\n“Heard you talking about poor Wren,” said Banshee, his eyes dancing. “Rude you was about poor Wren.” He took a deep breath and bellowed, “OY! MYRTLE!”\n\n“Oh, no, Banshee, don’t tell her what I said, she’ll be really upset,” Isla whispered frantically. “I didn’t mean it, I don’t mind her — er, hello, Wren.”\n\nThe squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Eli had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.\n\n“What?” she said sulkily.\n\n“How are you, Wren?” said Isla in a falsely bright voice. “It’s nice to see you out of the toilet.”\n\nWren sniffed.\n\n“Miss Hawke was just talking about you —” said Banshee slyly in Wren’s ear.\n\n“Just saying — saying — how nice you look tonight,” said Isla, glaring at Banshee.\n\nWren eyed Isla suspiciously.\n\n“You’re making fun of me,” she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes.\n\n“No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Wren’s looking?” said Isla, nudging Eli and Leo painfully in the ribs.\n\n“Oh, yeah —”\n\n“She did —”\n\n“Don’t lie to me,” Wren gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while Banshee chuckled happily over her shoulder. “D’you think I don’t know what people call me behind my back? Fat Wren! Ugly Wren! Miserable, moaning, moping Wren!”\n\n“You’ve forgotten pimply,” Banshee hissed in her ear.\n\nWailing Wren burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon. Banshee shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, “Pimply! Pimply!”\n\n“Oh, dear,” said Isla sadly.\n\nBarely Headless Nate now drifted toward them through the crowd.\n\n“Enjoying yourselves?”\n\n“Oh, yes,” they lied.\n\n“Not a bad turnout,” said Barely Headless Nate proudly. “The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent. … It’s nearly time for my speech, I’d better go and warn the orchestra. …”\n\nThe orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded.\n\n“Oh, here we go,” said Barely Headless Nate bitterly.\n\nThrough the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Eli started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick’s face.\n\nThe horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Barely Headless Nate, squashing his head back onto his neck.\n\n“Nick!” he roared. “How are you? Head still hanging in there?”\n\nHe gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Barely Headless Nate on the shoulder.\n\n“Welcome, Patrick,” said Nick stiffly.\n\n“Live ’uns!” said Sir Reginald, spotting Eli, Leo, and Isla and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter).\n\n“Very amusing,” said Barely Headless Nate darkly.\n\n“Don’t mind Nick!” shouted Sir Reginald’s head from the floor. “Still upset we won’t let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say — look at the fellow —”\n\n“I think,” said Eli hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, “Nick’s very — frightening and — er —”\n\n“Ha!” yelled Sir Reginald’s head. “Bet he asked you to say that!”\n\n“If I could have everyone’s attention, it’s time for my speech!” said Barely Headless Nate loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight.\n\n“My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow …”\n\nBut nobody heard much more. Sir Reginald and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. Barely Headless Nate tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave up as Sir Reginald’s head went sailing past him to loud cheers.\n\nEli was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.\n\n“I can’t stand much more of this,” Leo muttered, his teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor.\n\n“Let’s go,” Eli agreed.\n\nThey backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles.\n\n“Pudding might not be finished yet,” said Leo hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall.\n\nAnd then Eli heard it.\n\n“… rip … tear … kill …”\n\nIt was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in Bright’s office.\n\nHe stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.\n\n“Eli, what’re you — ?”\n\n“It’s that voice again — shut up a minute —”\n\n“… soo hungry … for so long …”\n\n“Listen!” said Eli urgently, and Leo and Isla froze, watching him.\n\n“… kill … time to kill …”\n\nThe voice was growing fainter. Eli was sure it was moving away — moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn’t matter?\n\n“This way,” he shou",

    "context": "day, when he came in from playing, the door of the inner room was open, and he saw them lying together on the bed, asleep--white Diana and Nico almost black beside her, with one arm under her shoulders and the other dark hand on her breast, and one of the plaits of his long hair lying across her throat, like a black snake trying to strangle her. Nico's gourd and a cup were standing on the floor near the bed. Diana was snoring.\n\nHis heart seemed to have disappeared and left a hole. He was empty. Empty, and cold, and rather sick, and giddy. He leaned against the wall to steady himself. Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous... Like drums, like the men singing for the corn, like magic, the words repeated and repeated themselves in his head. From being cold he was suddenly hot. His cheeks burnt with the rush of blood, the room swam and darkened before his eyes. He ground his teeth. 'I'll kill him, I'll kill him, I'll kill him,' he kept saying. And suddenly there were more words.\n\nWhen he is drunk asleep, or in his rage\nOr in the incestuous pleasure of his bed...\nThe magic was on his side, the magic explained and gave orders. He stepped back into the outer room. 'When he is drunk asleep...' The knife for the meat was lying on the floor near the fireplace. He picked it up and tiptoed to the door again. 'When he is drunk asleep, drunk asleep...' He ran across the room and stabbed--oh, the blood!--stabbed again, as Nico heaved out of his sleep, lifted his hand to stab once more, but found his wrist caught, held and--oh, oh!--twisted. He couldn't move, he was trapped, and there were Nico's small black eyes, very close, staring into his own. He looked away. There were two cuts on Nico's left shoulder. 'Oh, look at the blood!' Diana was crying. 'Look at the blood!' She had never been able to bear the sight of blood. Nico lifted his other hand--to strike him, he thought. He stiffened to receive the blow. But the hand only took him under the chin and turned his face, so that he had to look again into Nico's eyes. For a long time, for hours and hours. And suddenly--he couldn't help it--he began to cry. Nico burst out laughing. 'Go,' he said, in the other Indian words. 'Go, my brave Ahaiyuta.' He ran out into the other room to hide his tears.\n\n****\n'You are fifteen,' said old Ziro, in the Indian words. 'Now I may teach you to work the clay.'\n\nSquatting by the river, they worked together.\n\n'First of all,' said Ziro, taking a lump of the wetted clay between his hands, 'we make a little moon.' The old man squeezed the lump into a disk, then bent up the edges; the moon became a shallow cup.\n\nSlowly and unskilfully he imitated the old man's delicate gestures.\n\n'A moon, a cup, and now a snake.' Ziro rolled out another piece of clay into a long flexible cylinder, hooped it into a circle and pressed it on to the rim of the cup. 'Then another snake. And another. And another.' Round by round, Ziro built up the sides of the pot; it was narrow, it bulged, it narrowed again towards the neck. Ziro squeezed and patted, stroked and scraped; and there at last it stood, in shape the familiar water-pot of Malpais, but creamy white instead of black, and still soft to the touch. The crooked parody of Ziro's, his own stood beside it. Looking at the two pots, he had to laugh.\n\n'But the next one will be better,' he said, and began to moisten another piece of clay.\n\nTo fashion, to give form, to feel his fingers gaining in skill and power--this gave him an extraordinary pleasure. 'A, B, C, Vitamin D,' he sang to himself as he worked, 'The fat's in the liver, the cod's in the sea.' And Ziro also sang--a song about killing a bear. They worked all day, and all day he was filled with an intense, absorbing happiness.\n\n'Next winter,' said old Ziro, 'I will teach you to make the bow.'\n\n****\nHe stood for a long time outside the house; and at last the ceremonies within were finished. The door opened; they came out. Tenaru came first, his right hand outstretched and tightly closed, as though over some precious jewel. Her clenched hand similarly outstretched, Milyana followed. They walked in silence, and in silence, behind them, came the brothers and sisters and cousins and all the troop of old people.\n\nThey walked out of the pueblo, across the mesa. At the edge of the cliff they halted, facing the early morning sun. Tenaru opened his hand. A pinch of corn meal lay white on the palm; he breathed on it, murmured a few words, then threw it, a handful of white dust, towards the sun. Milyana did the same. Then Milyana's father stepped forward, and holding up a feathered prayer stick, made a long prayer, then threw the stick after the corn meal.\n\n'It is finished,' said old Ziro in a loud voice. 'They are married.'\n\n'Well,' said Diana, as they turned away, 'all I can say is, it does seem a lot of fuss to make about so little. In civilized countries, when a boy wants to have a girl, he just... But where are you going, Ian?'\n\nHe paid no attention to her calling, but ran on, away, away, anywhere to be by himself.\n\nIt is finished. Old Ziro's words repeated themselves in his mind. Finished, finished... In silence and from a long way off, but violently, desperately, hopelessly, he had loved Milyana. And now it was finished. He was sixteen.\n\n****\nAt the full moon, in the Antelope Kiva, secrets would be told, secrets would be done and borne. They would go down, boys, into the kiva and come out again, men. The boys were all afraid and at the same time impatient. And at last it was the day. The sun went down, the moon rose. He went with the others. Men were standing, dark, at the entrance to the kiva; the ladder went down into the red lighted depths. Already the leading boys had begun to climb down. Suddenly one of the men stepped forward, caught him by the arm, and pulled him out of the ranks. He broke free and dodged back into his place among the others. This time the man struck him, pulled his hair. 'Not for you, white-hair!' 'Not for the son of the she-dog,' said one of the other men. The boys laughed. 'Go!' And as he still hovered on the fringes of the group, 'Go!' the men shouted again. One of them bent down, took a stone, threw it. 'Go, go, go!' There was a shower of stones. Bleeding, he ran away into the darkness. From the red-lit kiva came the noise of singing. The last of the boys had climbed down the ladder. He was all alone.\n\nAll alone, outside the pueblo, on the bare plain of the mesa. The rock was like bleached bones in the moonlight. Down in the valley, the coyotes were howling at the moon. The bruises hurt him, the cuts were still bleeding; but it was not for pain that he sobbed; it was because he was all alone, because he had been driven out, alone, into this skeleton world of rocks and moonlight. At the edge of the precipice he sat down. The moon was behind him; he looked down into the black shadow of the mesa, into the black shadow of death. He had only to take one step, one little jump.... He held out his right hand in the moonlight. From the cut on his wrist the blood was still oozing. Every few seconds a drop fell, dark, almost colourless in the dead light. Drop, drop, drop. To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow...\n\nHe had discovered Time and Death and God.\n\n'Alone, always alone,' the young man was saying.\n\nThe words awoke a plaintive echo in Eliot's mind. Alone, alone... 'So am I,' he said, on a gush of confidingness. 'Terribly alone.'\n\n'Are you?' Ian looked surprised. 'I thought that in the Other Place... I mean, Diana always said that nobody was ever alone there.'\n\nEliot blushed uncomfortably. 'You see,' he said, mumbling and with averted eyes, 'I'm rather different from most people, I suppose. If one happens to be decanted different...'\n\n'Yes, that's just it.' The young man nodded. 'If one's different, one's bound to be lonely. They're beastly to one. Do you know, they shut me out of absolutely everything? When the other boys were sent out to spend the night on the mountains--you know, when you have to dream which your sacred animal is--they wouldn't let me go with the others; they wouldn't tell me any of the secrets. I did it by myself, though,' he added. 'Didn't eat anything for five days and then went out one night alone into those mountains there.' He pointed.\n\nPatronizingly, Eliot smiled. 'And did you dream of anything?' he asked.\n\nThe other nodded. 'But I mustn't tell you what.' He was silent for a little; then, in a low voice, 'Once,' he went on, 'I did something that none of the others did: I stood against a rock in the middle of the day, in summer, with my arms out, like Jesus on the cross.'\n\n'What on earth for?'\n\n'I wanted to know what it was like being crucified. Hanging there in the sun...'\n\n'But why?'\n\n'Why? Well...' He hesitated. 'Because I felt I ought to. If Jesus could stand it. And then, if one has done something wrong... Besides, I was unhappy; that was another reason.'\n\n'It seems a funny way of curing your unhappiness,' said Eliot. But on second thoughts he decided that there was, after all, some sense in it. Better than taking soma....\n\n'I fainted after a time,' said the young man. 'Fell down on my face. Do you see the mark where I cut myself?' He lifted the thick yellow hair from his forehead. The scar showed, pale and puckered, on his right temple.\n\nEliot looked, and then quickly, with a little shudder, averted his eyes. His conditioning had made him not so much pitiful as profoundly squeamish. The mere suggestion of illness or wounds was to him not only horrifying, but even repulsive and rather disgusting. Like dirt, or deformity, or old age. Hastily he changed the subject.\n\n'I wonder if you'd like to come back to London with us?' he asked, making the first move in a campaign whose strategy he had been secretly elaborating ever since, in the little house, he had realized who the 'father' of this young savage must be. 'Would you like that?'\n\nThe young man's face lit up. 'Do you really mean it?'\n\n'Of course; if I can get permission, that is.'\n\n'Diana too?'\n\n'Well...' He hesitated doubtfully. That revolting creature! No, it was impossible. Unless, unless... It suddenly occurred to Eliot that her very revoltingness might prove an enormous asset. 'But of course!' he cried, making up for his first hesitations with an excess of noisy cordiality.\n\nThe young man drew a deep breath. 'To think it should be coming true--what I've dreamt of all my life. Do you remember what Miranda says?'\n\n'Who's Miranda?'\n\nBut the young man had evidently not heard the question. 'O wonder!' he was saying; and his eyes shone, his face was brightly flushed. 'How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is!' The flush suddenly deepened; he was thinking of Arya, of an angel in bottle-green viscose, lustrous with youth and skin food, plump, benevolently smiling. His voice faltered. 'O brave new world,' he began, then suddenly interrupted himself; the blood had left his cheeks; he was as pale as paper. 'Are you married to her?' he asked.\n\n'Am I what?'\n\n'Married. You know--for ever. They say \"for ever\" in the Indian words; it can't be broken.'\n\n'Ford, no!' Eliot couldn't help laughing.\n\nIan also laughed, but for another reason--laughed for pure joy.\n\n'O brave new world,' he repeated. 'O brave new world that has such people in it. Let's start at once.'\n\n'You have a most peculiar way of talking sometimes,' said Eliot, staring at the young man in perplexed astonishment. 'And, anyhow, hadn't you better wait till you actually see the new world?'\n\n\nChapter IX\n\nArya felt herself entitled, after this day of queerness and horror, to a complete and absolute holiday. As soon as they got back to the rest-house, she swallowed six half-gramme tablets of soma, lay down on her bed, and within ten minutes had embarked for lunar eternity. It would be eighteen hours at the least before she was in time again.\n\nEliot meanwhile lay pensive and wide-eyed in the dark. It was long after midnight before he fell asleep. Long after midnight; but his insomnia had not been fruitless; he had a plan.\n\nPunctually, on the following morning, at ten o'clock, the green-uniformed octoroon stepped out of his helicopter. Eliot was waiting for him among the agaves.\n\n'Miss Crowne's gone on soma-holiday,' he explained. 'Can hardly be back before five. Which leaves us seven hours.'\n\nHe could fly to Santa Fé, do all the business he had to do, and be in Malpais again long before she woke up.\n\n'She'll be quite safe here by herself?'\n\n'Safe as helicopters,' the octoroon assured him.\n\nThey climbed into the machine and started off at once. At ten thirty-four they landed on the roof of the Santa Fé Post Office; at ten thirty-seven Eliot had got through to the World Controller's Office in Whitehall; at ten thirty-nine he was speaking to his fordship's fourth personal secretary; at ten forty-four he was repeating his story to the first secretary, and at ten forty-seven and a half it was the deep, resonant voice of Ulrich Ramsey himself that sounded in his ears.\n\n'I ventured to think,' stammered Eliot, 'that your fordship might find the matter of sufficient scientific interest...'\n\n'Yes, I do find it of sufficient scientific interest,' said the deep voice. 'Bring these two individuals back to London with you.'\n\n'Your fordship is aware that I shall need a special permit...'\n\n'The necessary orders,' said Ulrich Ramsey, 'are being sent to the Warden of the Reservation at this moment. You will proceed at once to the Warden's Office. Good-morning, Mr. Bryce.'\n\nThere was silence. Eliot hung up the receiver and hurried up to the roof.\n\n'Warden's Office,' he said to the Gamma-green octoroon.\n\nAt ten fifty-four Eliot was shaking hands with the Warden.\n\n'Delighted, Mr. Bryce, delighted.' His boom was deferential. 'We have just received special orders...'\n\n'I know,' said Eliot, interrupting him. 'I was talking to his fordship on the phone a moment ago.' His bored tone implied that he was in the habit of talking to his fordship every day of the week. He dropped into a chair. 'If you'll kindly take all the necessary steps as soon as possible. As soon as possible,' he emphatically repeated. He was thoroughly enjoying himself.\n\nAt eleven three he had all the necessary papers in his pocket.\n\n'So long,' he said patronizingly to the Warden, who had accompanied him as far as the lift gates. 'So long.'\n\nHe walked across to the hotel, had a bath, a vibro-vac massage, and an electrolytic shave, listened in to the morning's news, looked in for half an hour on the televisor, ate a leisured luncheon, and at half-past two flew back with the octoroon to Malpais.\n\n****\nThe young man stood outside the rest-house.\n\n'Eliot,' he called. 'Eliot!' There was no answer.\n\nNoiseless on his deerskin moccasins, he ran up the steps and tried the door. The door was locked.\n\nThey were gone! Gone! It was the most terrible thing that had ever happened to him. She had asked him to come and see them, and now they were gone. He sat down on the steps and cried.\n\nHalf an hour later it occurred to him to look through the window. The first thing he saw was a green suit-case, with the initials L. C. painted on the lid. Joy flared up like fire within him. He picked up a stone. The smashed glass tinkled on the floor. A moment later he was inside the room. He opened the green suit-case; and all at once he was breathing Arya's perfume, filling his lungs with her essential being. His heart beat wildly; for a moment he was almost faint. Then, bending over the precious box, he touched, he lifted into the light, he examined. The zippers on Arya's spare pair of viscose velveteen shorts were at first a puzzle, then, solved, a delight. Zip, and then zip; zip, and then zip; he was enchanted. Her green slippers were the most beautiful things he had ever seen. He unfolded a pair of zippicamiknicks, blushed, put them hastily away again; but kissed a perfumed acetate handkerchief and wound a scarf round his neck. Opening a box, he spilt a cloud of scented powder. His hands were floury with the stuff. He wiped them on his chest, on his shoulders, on his bare arms. Delicious perfume! He shut his eyes; he rubbed his cheek against his own powdered arm. Touch of smooth skin against his face, scent in his nostrils of musky dust--her real presence. 'Arya,' he whispered. 'Arya!'\n\nA noise made him start, made him guiltily turn. He crammed up his thieveries into the suit-case and shut the lid; then listened again, looked. Not a sign of life, not a sound. And yet he had certainly heard something--something like a sigh, something like the creak of a board. He tiptoed to the door and, cautiously opening it, found himself looking on to a broad landing. On the opposite side of the landing was another door, ajar. He stepped out, pushed, peeped.\n\nThere, on a low bed, the sheet flung back, dressed in a pair of pink one-piece zippyjamas, lay Arya, fast asleep and so beautiful in the midst of her curls, so touchingly childish with her pink toes and her grave sleeping face, so trustful in the helplessness of her limp hands and melted limbs, that the tears came to his eyes.\n\nWith an infinity of quite unnecessary precautions--for nothing short of a pisto-shot could have called Arya back from her soma-holiday before the appointed time--he entered the room, he knelt on the floor beside the bed. He gazed, he clasped his hands, his lips moved. 'Her eyes,' he murmured,\n\n'Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice;\nHandlest in thy discourse, O! that her hand,\nIn whose comparison all whites are ink\nWriting their own reproach; to whose soft seizure\nThe cygnet's down is harsh...'\nA fly buzzed round her; he waved it away. 'Flies,' he remembered,\n\n'On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand, may seize\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty,\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.'\nVery slowly, with the hesitating gesture of one who reaches forward to stroke a shy and possibly rather dangerous bird, he put out his hand. It hung there trembling, within an inch of those limp fingers, on the verge of contact. Did he dare? Dare to profane with his unworthiest hand that... No he didn't. The bird was too dangerous. His hand dropped back. How beautiful she was! How beautiful!\n\nThen suddenly he found himself reflecting that he had only to take hold of the zipper at her neck and give one long, strong pull.... He shut his eyes, he shook his head with the gesture of a dog shaking its ears as it emerges from the water. Detestable thought! He was ashamed of himself. Pure and vestal modesty...\n\nThere was a humming in the air. Another fly trying to steal immortal blessings? A wasp? He looked, saw nothing. The humming grew louder and louder, localized itself as being outside the shuttered windows. The plane! In a panic, he scrambled to his feet and ran into the other room, vaulted through the open window, and hurrying along the path between the tall agaves was in time to receive Eliot Bryce as he climbed out of the helicopter.\n\n\nChapter X\n\nThe hands of all the four thousand electric clocks in all the Bloomsbury Centre's four thousand rooms marked twenty-seven minutes past two. 'This hive of industry,' as the Chief Regalia was fond of calling it, was in the full buzz of work. Every one was busy, everything in ordered motion. Under the microscopes, their long tails furiously lashing, spermatozoa were burrowing head first into eggs; and, fertilized, the eggs were expanding, dividing, or if bokanovskified, budding and breaking up into whole populations of separate embryos. From the Social Predestination Room the escalators went rumbling down into the basement, and there, in the crimson darkness, stewingly warm on their cushion of peritoneum and gorged with blood-surrogate and hormones, the foetuses grew and grew or, poisoned, languished into a stunted Epsilonhood. With a faint hum and rattle the moving racks crawled imperceptibly through the weeks and the recapitulated æons to where, in the Decanting Room, the newly-unbottled babes uttered their first yell of horror and amazement.\n\nThe dynamos purred in the sub-basement, the lifts rushed up and down. On all the eleven floors of Nurseries it was feeding time. From eighteen hundred bottles eighteen hundred carefully labelled infants were simultaneously sucking down their pint of pasteurized external secretion.\n\nAbove them, in ten successive layers of dormitory, the little boys and girls who were still young enough to need an afternoon sleep were as busy as every one else, though they did not know it, listening unconsciously to hypnopædic lessons in hygiene and sociability, in class-consciousness and the toddler's love-life. Above these again were the playrooms where, the weather having turned to rain, nine hundred older children were amusing themselves with bricks and clay modelling, hunt-the-zipper, and erotic play.\n\nBuzz, buzz! the hive was humming, busily, joyfully. Blithe was the singing of the young girls over their test-tubes, the Predestinators whistled as they worked, and in the Decanting Room what glorious jokes were cracked above the empty bottles! But the Chief Regalia's face, as he entered the Fertilizing Room with Louis Harper, was grave, wooden with severity.\n\n'A public example,' he was saying. 'In this room, because it contains more high-caste workers than any other in the Centre. I have told him to meet me here at half-past two.'\n\n'He does his work very well,' put in Louis, with hypocritical generosity.\n\n'I know. But that's all the more reason for severity. His intellectual eminence carries with it corresponding moral responsibilities. The greater a man's talents, the greater his power to lead astray. It is better that one should suffer than that many should be corrupted. Consider the matter dispassionately, Mr. Harper, and you will see that no offence is so heinous as unorthodoxy of behaviour. Murder kills only the individual--and, after all, what is an individual?' With a sweeping gesture he indicated the rows of microscopes, the test-tubes, the incubators. 'We can make a new one with the greatest ease--as many as we like. Unorthodoxy threatens more than the life of a mere individual; it strikes at Society itself. Yes, at Society itself,' he repeated. 'Ah, but here he comes.'\n\nEliot had entered the room and was advancing between the rows of fertilizers towards them. A veneer of jaunty self-confidence thinly concealed his nervousness. The voice in which he said, 'Good-morning, Chief Regalia,' was absurdly too loud; that in which, correcting his mistake, he said, 'You asked me to come and speak to you here,' ridiculously soft, a squeak.\n\n'Yes, Mr. Bryce,' said the Chief Regalia portentously. 'I did ask you to come to me here. You returned from your holiday last night, I understand.'\n\n'Yes,' Eliot answered.\n\n'Yes-s,' repeated the Chief Regalia, lingering, a serpent, on the 's.' Then, suddenly raising his voice, 'Ladies and gentlemen,' he trumpeted, 'ladies and gentlemen.'\n\nThe singing of the girls over their test-tubes, the preoccupied whistling of the Microscopists, suddenly ceased. There was a profound silence; every one looked round.\n\n'Ladies and gentlemen,' the Chief Regalia repeated once more, 'excuse me for thus interrupting your labours. A painful duty constrains me. The security and stability of Society are in danger. Yes, in danger, ladies and gentlemen. This man,' he pointed accusingly at Eliot, 'this man who stands before you here, this Alpha-Plus to whom so much has been given, and from whom, in consequence, so much must be expected, this colleague of yours--or should I anticipate and say this ex-colleague?--has grossly betrayed the trust imposed in him. By his heretical views on sport and soma, by the scandalous unorthodoxy of his sex-life, by his refusal to obey the teachings of Our Ford and behave out of office hours \"like a babe in a bottle\"' (here the Chief Regalia made the sign of the T), 'he has proved himself an enemy of Society, a subverter, ladies and gentlemen, of all Order and Stability, a conspirator against Civilization itself. For this reason I propose to dismiss him, to dismiss him with ignominy from the post he has held in this Centre; I propose forthwith to apply for his transference to a Sub-Centre of the lowest order and, that his punishment may serve the best interest of Society, as far as possible removed from any important Centre of population. In Iceland he will have small opportunity to lead others astray by his unfordly example.' The Chief Regalia paused; then, folding his arms, he turned impressively to Eliot. 'Bryce,' he said, 'can you show any reason why I should not now execute the judgment passed upon you?'\n\n'Yes, I can,' Eliot answered in a very loud voice.\n\nSomewhat taken aback, but still majestically, 'Then show it,' said the Chief Regalia.\n\n'Certainly. But it's in the passage. One moment.' Eliot hurried to the door and threw it open. 'Come in,' he commanded, and the reason came in and showed itself.\n\nThere was a gasp, a murmur of astonishment and horror; a young girl screamed; standing on a chair to get a better view some one upset two test-tubes full of spermatozoa. Bloated, sagging, and among those firm youthful bodies, those undistorted faces, a strange and terrifying monster of middle-agedness, Diana advanced into the room, coquettishly smiling her broken and discoloured smile, and rolling as she walked, with what was meant to be a voluptuous undulation, her enormous haunches. Eliot walked beside her.\n\n'There he is,' he said, pointing at the Chief Regalia.\n\n'Did you think I didn't recognize him?' Diana asked indignantly; then, turning to the Chief Regalia, 'Of course I knew you; Eldon, I should have known you anywhere, among a thousand. But perhaps you've forgotten me. Don't you remember? Don't you remember, Eldon? Your Diana.' She stood looking at him, her head on one side, still smiling, but with a smile that became progressively, in face of the Chief Regalia's expression of petrified disgust, less and less self-confident, that wavered and finally went out. 'Don't you remember, Eldon?' she repeated in a voice that trembled. Her eyes were anxious, agonized. The blotched and sagging face twitched grotesquely into the grimace of extreme grief. 'Eldon!' She held out her arms. Some one began to titter.\n\n'What's the meaning,' began the Chief Regalia, 'of this monstrous...'\n\n'Eldon!' She ran forward, her blanket trailing behind her, threw her arms round his neck, hid her face on his chest.\n\nA howl of laughter went up irrepressibly.\n\n'...this monstrous practical joke,' the Chief Regalia shouted.\n\nRed in the face, he tried to disengage himself from her embrace. Desperately she clung. 'But I'm Diana, I'm Diana.' The laughter drowned her voice. 'You made me have a baby,' she screamed above the uproar. There was a sudden and appalling hush; eyes floated uncomfortably, not knowing where to look. The Chief Regalia went suddenly pale, stopped struggling and stood, his hands on her wrists, staring down at her, horrified. 'Yes, a baby--and I was its mother.' She flung the obscenity like a challenge into the outraged silence; then, suddenly breaking away from him, ashamed, ashamed, covered her face with her hands, sobbing. 'It wasn't my fault, Eldon. Because I always did my drill, didn't I? Didn't I? Always... I don't know how... If you knew how awful, Eldon... But he was a comfort to me, all the same.' Turning towards the door, 'Ian!' she called. 'Ian!'\n\nHe came in at once, paused for a moment just inside the door, looked round, then soft on his moccasined feet strode quickly across the room, fell on his knees in front of the Chief Regalia, and said in a clear voice: 'My father!'\n\nThe word (for 'father' was not so much obscene as--with its connotation of something at one remove from the loathsomeness and moral obliquity of child-bearing--merely gross, a scatological rather than a pornographic impropriety), the comically smutty word relieved what had become a quite intolerable tension. Laughter broke out, enormous, almost hysterical, peal after peal, as though it would never stop. My father--and it was the Chief Regalia! My father! Oh, Ford, oh Ford! That was really too good. The whooping and the roaring renewed themselves, faces seemed on the point of disintegration, tears were streaming. Six more test-tubes of spermatozoa were upset. My father!\n\nPale, wild-eyed, the Chief Regalia glared about him in an agony of bewildered humiliation.\n\nMy father! The laughter, which had shown signs of dying away, broke out again more loudly than ever. He put his hands over his ears and rushed out of the room.\n\n\nChapter XI\n\nAfter the scene in the Fertilizing Room, all upper-caste London was wild to see this delicious creature who had fallen on his knees before the Chief Regalia of Hatcheries and Conditioning--or rather the ex-Chief Regalia, for the poor man had resigned immediately afterwards and never set foot inside the Centre again--had flopped down and called him (the joke was almost too good to be true!) 'my father.' Diana, on the contrary, cut no ice; nobody had the smallest desire to see Diana. To say one was a mother--that was past a joke: it was an obscenity. Moreover, she wasn't a real savage, had been hatched out of a bottle and conditioned like any one else: so couldn't have really quaint ideas. Finally--and this was by far the strongest reason for people's not wanting to see poor Diana--there was her appearance. Fat; having lost her youth; with bad teeth, and a blotched complexion, and that figure (Ford!)--you simply couldn't look at her without feeling sick, yes, positively sick. So the best people were quite determined not to see Diana. And Diana, for her part, had no desire to see them. The return to civilization was for her the return to soma, was the possibility of lying in bed and taking holiday after holiday, without ever having to come back to a headache or a fit of vomiting, without ever being made to feel as you always felt after peyotl, as though you'd done something so shamefully anti-social that you could never hold up your head again. Soma played none of these unpleasant tricks. The holiday it gave was perfect and, if the morning after was disagreeable, it was so, not intrinsically, but only by comparison with the joys of the holiday. The remedy was to make the holiday continuous. Greedily she clamoured for ever larger, ever more frequent doses. Dr. Yates at first demurred; then let her have what she wanted. She took as much as twenty grammes a day.\n\n'Which will finish her off in a month or two,' the doctor confided to Eliot. 'One day the respiratory centre will be paralysed. No more breathing. Finished. And a good thing too. If we could rejuvenate, of course it would be different. But we can't.'\n\nSurprisingly, as every one thought (for on soma-holiday Diana was most conveniently out of the way), Ian raised objections.\n\n'But aren't you shortening her life by giving her so much?'\n\n'In one sense, yes,' Dr. Yates admitted. 'But in another we're actually lengthening it.' The young man stared, uncomprehending. 'Soma may make you lose a few years in time,' the doctor went on. 'But think of the enormous, immeasurable durations it can give you out of time. Every soma-holiday is a bit of what our ancestors used to call eternity.'\n\nIan began to understand. 'Eternity was in our lips and eyes,' he murmured.\n\n'Eh?'\n\n'Nothing,'\n\n'Of course,' Dr. Yates went on, 'you can't allow people to go popping off into eternity if they've got any serious work to do. But as she hasn't got any serious work...'\n\n'All the same,' Ian persisted, 'I don't believe it's right.'\n\nThe doctor shrugged his shoulders. 'Well, of course, if you prefer to have her screaming mad all the time...'\n\nIn the end Ian was forced to give in. Diana got her soma. Thenceforward she remained in her little room on the thirty-seventh floor of Eliot's apartment house, in bed, with the radio and television always on, and the patchouli tap just dripping, and the soma tablets within reach of her hand--there she remained; and yet wasn't there at all, was all the time away, infinitely far away, on holiday; on holiday in some other world, where the music of the radio was a labyrinth of sonorous colours, a sliding, palpitating labyrinth, that led (by what beautifully inevitable windings) to a bright centre of absolute conviction; where the dancing images of the television box were the performers in some indescribably delicious all-singing feely; where the dripping patchouli was more than scent--was the sun, was a million sexophones, was Nico making love, only much more so, incomparably more, and without end.\n\n'No, we can't rejuvenate. But I'm very glad,' Dr. Yates had concluded, 'to have had this opportunity to see an example of senility in a human being. Thank you so much for calling me in.' He shook Eliot warmly by the hand.\n\nIt was Ian, then, they were all after. And as it was only through Eliot, his accredited guardian, that Ian could be seen, Eliot now found himself, for the first time in his life, treated not merely normally, but as a person of outstanding importance. There was no more talk of the alcohol in his blood-surrogate, no gibes at his personal appearance. Louis Harper went out of his way to be friendly; Ezra Clay made him a present of six packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum; the Assistant Predestinator came and cadged almost abjectly for an invitation to one of Eliot's evening parties. As for the women, Eliot had only to hint at the possibility of an invitation, and he could have whichever of them he liked.\n\n'Eliot's asked me to meet the Wildling next Wednesday,' Mara announced triumphantly.\n\n'I'm so glad,' said Arya. 'And now you must admit that you were wrong about Eliot. Don't you think he's really rather sweet?'\n\nMara nodded. 'And I must say,' she said, 'I was quite agreeably surprised.'\n\nThe Chief Bottler, the Chief Regalia of Predestination, three Deputy Assistant Fertilizer-Generals, the Professor of Feelies in the College of Emotional Engineering, the Dean of the Westminster Community Singery, the Supervisor of Bokanovskification--the list of Eliot's notabilities was interminable.\n\n'And I had six girls last week,' he confided to Kendrick Aster. 'One on Monday, two on Tuesday, two more on Friday, and one on Saturday. And if I'd had the time or the inclination, there were at least a dozen more who were only too anxious...'\n\nKendrick listened to his boastings in a silence so gloomily disapproving that Eliot was offended.\n\n'You're envious,' he said.\n\nKendrick shook his head. 'I'm rather sad, that's all,' he answered.\n\nEliot went off in a huff. Never, he told himself, never would he speak to Kendrick again.\n\nThe days passed. Success went fizzily to Eliot's head, and in the process completely reconciled him (as any good intoxicant should do) to a world which, up till then, he had found very unsatisfactory. In so far as it recognized him as important, the order of things was good. But, reconciled by his success, he yet refused to forgo the privilege of criticizing this order. For the act of criticizing heightened his sense of importance, made him feel larger. Moreover, he did genuinely believe that there were things to criticize. (At the same time, he genuinely liked being a success and having all the girls he wanted.) Before those who now, for the sake of the Wildling, paid their court to him, Eliot would parade a carping unorthodoxy. He was politely listened to. But behind his back people shook their heads. 'That young man will come to a bad end,' they said, prophesying the more confidently in that they themselves would in due course personally see to it that the end was bad. 'He won't find another Wildling to help him out a second time,' they said. Meanwhile, however, there was the first Wildling; they were polite. And because they were polite, Eliot felt positively gigantic--gigantic and at the same time light with elation, lighter than air.\n\n****\n'Lighter than air,' said Eliot, pointing upwards.\n\nLike a pearl in the sky, high, high above them, the Weather Department's captive balloon shone rosily in the sunshine.\n\n'...the said Wildling,' so ran Eliot's instructions, 'to be shown civilized life in all its aspects....'\n\nHe was being shown a bird's-eye view of it at present, a bird's-eye view from the platform of the Charing-T Tower. The Station Master and the Resident Meteorologist were acting as guides. But it was Eliot who did most of the talking. Intoxicated, he was behaving as though, at the very least, he were a visiting World Controller. Lighter than air.\n\nThe Bombay Green Rocket dropped out of the sky. The passengers alighted. Eight identical Dravidian twins in khaki looked out of the eight portholes of the cabin--the stewards.\n\n'Twelve hundred and fifty kilometres an hour,' said the Station Master impressively. 'What do you think of that, Mr. Wildling?'\n\nIan thought it very nice. 'Still,' he said, 'Ariel could put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes.'\n\n****\n'The Wildling,' wrote Eliot in his report to Ulrich Ramsey, 'shows surprisingly little astonishment at, or awe of, civilized inventions. This is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that he has heard them talked about by the woman Diana, his m----.'\n\n(Ulrich Ramsey frowned. 'Does the fool think I'm too squeamish to see the word written out at full length?')\n\n'Partly on his interest being focussed on what he calls \"the soul,\" which he persists as regarding as an entity independent of the physical environment; whereas, as I tried to point out to him...'\n\nThe Controller skipped the next sentences and was just about to turn the page in search of som",

    "context": " night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that [43] makes men mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.\n\nYet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted image of himself, came over him. It had altered already, and would alter more. Its gold would wither into gray. Its red and white roses would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. He would resist temptation. He would not see Lord Leopold any more,--would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Cassius Ainsworth's garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things. He would go back to Livia West, make her amends, marry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She must have suffered more than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish and cruel to her. The fascination that she had exercised over him would return. They would be happy together. His life with her would be beautiful and pure.\n\nHe got up from his chair, and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. \"How horrible!\" he murmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he stepped out on the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of Livia West. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name over and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n[...43] It was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several times into the room on tiptoe to see if he was stirring, and had wondered what made his young master sleep so late. Finally his bell sounded, and Julian came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a small tray of old Sèvres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall windows.\n\n\"Monsieur has well slept this morning,\" he said, smiling.\n\n\"What o'clock is it, Julian?\" asked Lucian Sterling, sleepily.\n\n\"One hour and a quarter, monsieur.\"\n\nHow late it was! He sat up, and, having sipped some tea, turned over his letters. One of them was from Lord Leopold, and had been brought by hand that morning. He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The others he opened listlessly. They contained the usual collection of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of charity concerts, and the like, that are showered on fashionable young men every morning during the season. There was a [44] rather heavy bill, for a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set, that he had not yet had the courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when only unnecessary things are absolutely necessary to us; and there were several very courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders offering to advance any sum of money at a moment's notice and at the most reasonable rates of interest.\n\nAfter about ten minutes he got up, and, throwing on an elaborate dressing-gown, passed into the onyx-paved bath-room. The cool water refreshed him after his long sleep. He seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through. A dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it.\n\nAs soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a light French breakfast, that had been laid out for him on a small round table close to an open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air seemed laden with spices. A bee flew in, and buzzed round the blue-dragon bowl, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, that stood in front of him. He felt perfectly happy.\n\nSuddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the portrait, and he started.\n\n\"Too cold for Monsieur?\" asked his valet, putting an omelette on the table. \"I shut the window?\"\n\nLucian shook his head. \"I am not cold,\" he murmured.\n\nWas it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there had been a look of joy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Cassius some day. It would make him smile.\n\nAnd, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First in the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of cruelty in the warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet leaving the room. He knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the portrait. He was afraid of certainty. When the coffee and cigarettes had been brought and the man turned to go, he felt a mad desire to tell him to remain. As the door closed behind him he called him back. The man stood waiting for his orders. Lucian looked at him for a moment. \"I am not at home to any one, Julian,\" he said, with a sigh. The man bowed and retired.\n\nHe rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on a luxuriously-cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen was an old one of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it curiously, wondering if it had ever before concealed the secret of a man's life.\n\nShould he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What was the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was not true, why trouble about it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier chance, other eyes than his spied behind, and saw the horrible change? What should he do if Cassius Ainsworth came and asked to look at his own picture? He would be sure to do that. No; the [45] thing had to be examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful state of doubt.\n\nHe got up, and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he looked upon the mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside, and saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had altered.\n\nAs he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. Was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms, that shaped themselves into form and color on the canvas, and the soul that was within him? Could it be that what that soul thought, they realized?--that what it dreamed, they made true? Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the picture in sickened horror.\n\nOne thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made him conscious how unjust, how cruel, he had been to Livia West. It was not too late to make reparation for that. She could still be his wife. His unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Cassius Ainsworth had painted of him would be a guide to him through life, would be to him what holiness was to some, and conscience to others, and the fear of God to us all. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls.\n\nThree o'clock struck, and four, and half-past four, but he did not stir. He was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of life, and to weave them into a pattern; to find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved, imploring her forgiveness, and accusing himself of madness. He covered page after page with wild words of sorrow, and wilder words of pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Lucian Sterling had finished the letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.\n\nSuddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Leopold's voice outside. \"My dear Lucian, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can't bear your shutting yourself up like this.\"\n\nHe made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking still continued, and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Leopold in, and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was inevitable. He jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture, and unlocked the door.\n\n\"I am so sorry for it all, my dear boy,\" said Lord Leopold, coming in. \"But you must not think about it too much.\"\n\n[46] \"Do you mean about Livia West?\" asked Lucian.\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" answered Lord Leopold, sinking into a chair, and slowly pulling his gloves off. \"It is dreadful, from one point of view, but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her after the play was over?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?\"\n\n\"I was brutal, Leo,--perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I am not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know myself better.\"\n\n\"Ah, Lucian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would find you plunged in remorse, and tearing your nice hair.\"\n\n\"I have got through all that,\" said Lucian, shaking his head, and smiling. \"I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin with. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in us. Don't sneer at it, Leo, any more,--at least not before me. I want to be good. I can't bear the idea of my soul being hideous.\"\n\n\"A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Lucian! I congratulate you on it. But how are you going to begin?\"\n\n\"By marrying Livia West.\"\n\n\"Marrying Livia West!\" cried Lord Leopold, standing up, and looking at him in perplexed amazement. \"But, my dear Lucian--\"\n\n\"Yes, Leo, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about marriage. Don't say it. Don't ever say things of that kind to me again. Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word to her. She is to be my wife.\"\n\n\"Your wife! Lucian! . . . Didn't you get my letter? I wrote to you this morning, and sent the note down, by my own man.\"\n\n\"Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Leo. I was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn't like.\"\n\nLord Leopold walked across the room, and, sitting down by Lucian Sterling, took both his hands in his, and held them tightly. \"Lucian,\" he said, \"my letter--don't be frightened--was to tell you that Livia West is dead.\"\n\nA cry of pain rose from the lad's lips, and he leaped to his feet, tearing his hands away from Lord Leopold's grasp. \"Dead! Sibyl dead! It is not true! It is a horrible lie!\"\n\n\"It is quite true, Lucian,\" said Lord Leopold, gravely. \"It is in all the morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris. But in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make one's début with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an interest to one's old age. I don't suppose they know your name at the theatre. If they don't, it is all right. Did any one see you going round to her room? That is an important point.\"\n\nLucian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with horror. Finally he murmured, in a stifled voice, \"Leo, did you say an inquest? What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl--? Oh, [47] Leo, I can't bear it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt it was not an accident, Lucian, though it must be put in that way to the public. As she was leaving the theatre with her mother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had forgotten something up-stairs. They waited some time for her, but she did not come down again. They ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing-room. She had swallowed something by mistake, some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don't know what it was, but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it. I should fancy it was prussic acid, as she seems to have died instantaneously. It is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed up in it. I see by the Standard that she was seventeen. I should have thought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and seemed to know so little about acting. Lucian, you mustn't let this thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and afterwards we will look in at the Opera. It is a Patti night, and everybody will be there. You can come to my sister's box. She has got some smart women with her.\"\n\n\"So I have murdered Livia West,\" said Lucian Sterling, half to himself,--\"murdered her as certainly as if I had cut her little throat with a knife. And the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden. And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go on to the Opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How extraordinarily dramatic life is! If I had read all this in a book, Leo, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears. Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent people we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh, Leo, how I loved her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was everything to me. Then came that dreadful night--was it really only last night?--when she played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a bit. I thought her shallow. Then something happened that made me afraid. I can't tell you what it was, but it was awful. I said I would go back to her. I felt I had done wrong. And now she is dead. My God! my God! Leo, what shall I do? You don't know the danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight. She would have done that for me. She had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her.\"\n\n\"My dear Lucian, the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life. If you had married this girl you would have been wretched. Of course you would have treated her kindly. One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman's husband has to [48] pay for. I say nothing about the social mistake, but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.\"\n\n\"I suppose it would,\" muttered the lad, walking up and down the room, and looking horribly pale. \"But I thought it was my duty. It is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right. I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good resolutions,--that they are always made too late. Mine certainly were.\"\n\n\"Good resolutions are simply a useless attempt to interfere with scientific laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely nil. They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for us. That is all that can be said for them.\"\n\n\"Leo,\" cried Lucian Sterling, coming over and sitting down beside him, \"why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I don't think I am heartless. Do you?\"\n\n\"You have done too many foolish things in your life to be entitled to give yourself that name, Lucian,\" answered Lord Leopold, with his sweet, melancholy smile.\n\nThe lad frowned. \"I don't like that explanation, Leo,\" he rejoined, \"but I am glad you don't think I am heartless. I am nothing of the kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the terrible beauty of a great tragedy, a tragedy in which I took part, but by which I have not been wounded.\"\n\n\"It is an interesting question,\" said Lord Leopold, who found an exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism,--\"an extremely interesting question. I fancy that the explanation is this. It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that has artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened? Some one has killed herself for love of you. I wish I had ever had such an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life. The people who have adored me--there have not been very many, but there have been some--have always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have become stout and tedious, and when I meet them they go in at once for reminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb the color of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.\n\n[49] \"Of course, now and then things linger. I once wore nothing but violets all through one season, as mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one with the terror of eternity. Well,--would you believe it?--a week ago, at Lady Hampshire's, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future. I had buried my romance in a bed of poppies. She dragged it out again, and assured me that I had spoiled her life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she showed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over they propose to continue it. If they were allowed to have their way, every comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce. They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You are more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Lucian, that not one of the women I have known would have done for me what Livia West did for you. Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by going in for sentimental colors. Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history. Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one's face, as if it was the most fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me; and I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. There is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one of all.\"\n\n\"What is that, Leo?\" said Lucian Sterling, listlessly.\n\n\"Oh, the obvious one. Taking some one else's admirer when one loses one's own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But really, Lucian, how different Livia West must have been from all the women one meets! There is something to me quite beautiful about her death. I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen. They make one believe in the reality of the things that shallow, fashionable people play with, such as romance, passion, and love.\"\n\n\"I was terribly cruel to her. You forget that.\"\n\n\"I believe that women appreciate cruelty more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were splendid. I have never seen you angry, but I can fancy how delightful you looked. And, after all, you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it explains everything.\"\n\n[50] \"What was that, Leo?\"\n\n\"You said to me that Livia West represented to you all the heroines of romance--that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that if she died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.\"\n\n\"She will never come to life again now,\" murmured the lad, burying his face in his hands.\n\n\"No, she will never come to life. She has played her last part. But you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl never really lived, and so she has never really died. To you at least she was always a dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare's plays and left them lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare's music sounded richer and more full of joy. The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it marred her, and so she passed away. Mourn for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died. But don't waste your tears over Livia West. She was less real than they are.\"\n\nThere was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The colors faded wearily out of things.\n\nAfter some time Lucian Sterling looked up. \"You have explained me to myself, Leo,\" he murmured, with something of a sigh of relief. \"I felt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not express it to myself. How well you know me! But we will not talk again of what has happened. It has been a marvellous experience. That is all. I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous.\"\n\n\"Life has everything in store for you, Lucian. There is nothing that you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.\"\n\n\"But suppose, Leo, I became haggard, and gray, and wrinkled? What then?\"\n\n\"Ah, then,\" said Lord Leopold, rising to go,--\"then, my dear Lucian, you would have to fight for your victories. As it is, they are brought to you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you. And now you had better dress, and drive down to the club. We are rather late, as it is.\"\n\n\"I think I shall join you at the Opera, Leo. I feel too tired to eat anything. What is the number of your sister's box?\"\n\n\"Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her name on the door. But I am sorry you won't come and dine.\"\n\n\"I don't feel up to it,\" said Lucian, wearily. \"But I am awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are certainly my best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have.\"\n\n\"We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Lucian,\" answered Lord Leopold, shaking him by the hand. \"Good-by. I shall see you before nine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing.\"\n\nAs he closed the door behind him, Lucian Sterling touched the bell, [51] and in a few minutes Julian appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down. He waited impatiently for him to go. The man seemed to take an interminable time about everything.\n\nAs soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen, and drew it back. No; there was no further change in the picture. It had received the news of Livia West's death before he had known of it himself. It was conscious of the events of life as they occurred. The vicious cruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was. Or was it indifferent to results? Did it merely take cognizance of what passed within the soul? he wondered, and hoped that some day he would see the change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering as he hoped it.\n\nPoor Sibyl! what a romance it had all been! She had often mimicked death on the stage, and at last Death himself had touched her, and brought her with him. How had she played that dreadful scene? Had she cursed him, as she died? No; she had died for love of him, and love would always be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for everything, by the sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not think any more of what she had made him go through, that horrible night at the theatre. When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure to show Love had been a great reality. A wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her child-like look and winsome fanciful ways and shy tremulous grace. He wiped them away hastily, and looked again at the picture.\n\nHe felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him,--life, and his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins,--he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all.\n\nA feeling of pain came over him as he thought of the desecration that was in store for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning after morning he had sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as it seemed to him at times. Was it to alter now with every mood to which he yielded? Was it to become a hideous and loathsome thing, to be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of the hair? The pity of it! the pity of it!\n\nFor a moment he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that existed between him and the picture might cease. It had changed in answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain unchanged. And, yet, who, that knew anything about Life, would surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught? Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayer that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its [52] influence upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire, might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passions, atom calling to atom, in secret love or strange affinity? But the reason was of no importance. He would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?\n\nFor there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came upon it, he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer. When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the colored image on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.\n\nHe drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture, smiling as he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was already waiting for him. An hour later he was at the Opera, and Lord Leopold was leaning over his chair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n[...52] As he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Cassius Ainsworth was",

I could see his trusty highball glass in his hand. \n\n\"You're a very, very strange boy.\" \n\n\"I know it,\" I said. I didn’t even look around much for my tie. So I went without it. \"Good-by, sir,\" I said, \"Thanks a lot. No kidding.\" \n\nHe kept walking right behind me when I went to the front door, and when I rang the elevator bell he stayed in the damn doorway. All he said was that business about my being a \"very, very strange boy\" again. Strange, my ass. Then he waited in the doorway and all till the goddam elevator came. I never waited so long for an elevator in my whole goddam life. I swear. \n\nI didn’t know what the hell to talk about while I was waiting for the elevator, and he kept standing there, so I said, \"I'm gonna start reading some good books. I really am.\" \n\nI mean you had to say something. It was very embarrassing. \n\n\"You grab your bags and scoot right on back here again. I'll leave the door unlatched.\" \n\n\"Thanks a lot,\" I said. \"G’by!\" The elevator was finally there. I got in and went down. Boy, I was shaking like a madman. I was sweating, too. When something perverty like that happens, I start sweating like a bastard. That kind of stuffs happened to me about twenty times since I was a kid. I can’t stand it. \n\n25 \n\nWhen I got outside, it was just getting light out. It was pretty cold, too, but it felt good because I was sweating so much. \n\nI didn’t know where the hell to go. I didn’t want to go to another hotel and spend all Stella’s dough. So finally all I did was I walked over to Lexington and took the subway down to Grand Central. My bags were there and all, and I figured I’d sleep in that crazy waiting room where all the benches are. So that's what I did. It wasn't too bad for a while because there weren’t many people around and I could stick my feet up. But I don't feel much like discussing it. It wasn’t too nice. Don’t ever try it. I mean it. It'll depress you. \n\nI only slept till around nine o'clock because a million people started coming in the waiting room and I had to take my feet down. I can't sleep so hot if I have to keep my feet on the floor. So I sat up. I still had that headache. It was even worse. And I think I was more depressed than I ever was in my whole life. \n\nI didn’t want to, but I started thinking about old Mr. Steele and I wondered what he’d tell Mrs. Steele when she saw I hadn’t slept there or anything. That part didn’t worry me too much, though, because I knew Mr. Steele was very smart and that he could make up something to tell her. He could tell her I’d gone home or something. That part didn’t worry me much. But what did worry me was the part about how I'd woke up and found him patting me on the head and all. I mean I wondered if just maybe I was wrong about thinking be was making a flitty pass at ne. I wondered if maybe he just liked to pat guys on the head when they're asleep. I mean how can you tell about that stuff for sure? You can’t. I even started wondering if maybe I should've got my bags and gone back to his house, the way I’d said I would. I mean I started thinking that even if he was a flit he certainly'd been very nice to me. I thought how he hadn’t minded it when I'd called him up so late, and how he’d told me to come right over if I felt like it. And how he went to all that trouble giving me that advice about finding out the size of your mind and all, and how he was the only guy that' d even gone near that boy Hugh Tennyson I told you about when he was dead. I thought about all that stuff. And the more I thought about it, the more depressed I got. I mean I started thinking maybe I should've gone back to his house. Maybe he was only patting my head just for the hell of it. The more I thought about it, though, the more depressed and screwed up about it I got. What made it even worse, my eyes were sore as hell. They felt sore and bumy from not getting too much sleep. Besides that, I was getting sort of a cold, and I didn’t even have a goddam handkerchief with me. I had some in my suitcase, but I didn’t feel like taking it out of that strong box and opening it up right in public and all. \n\nThere was this magazine that somebody’d left on the bench next to me, so I started reading it, thinking it’d make me stop thinking about Mr. Steele and a million other things for at least a little while. But this damn article I started reading made me feel almost worse. It was all about honnones. It described how you should look, your face and eyes and all, if your hormones were in good shape, and I didn’t look that way at all. I looked exactly like the guy in the article with lousy hormones. So I started getting worried about my honnones. Then I read this other article about how you can tell if you have cancer or not. It said if you had any sores in your mouth that didn’t heal pretty quickly, it was a sign that you probably had cancer. I'd had this sore on the inside of my lip for about two weeks. So figured I was getting cancer. That magazine was some little cheerer upper. I finally quit reading it and went outside for a walk. I figured I’d be dead in a couple of months because I had cancer. I really did. I was even positive I would be. It certainly didn’t make me feel too gorgeous. If sort of looked like it was going to rain, but I went for this walk anyway. For one thing, I figured I ought to get some breakfast. I wasn’t at all hungry, but I figured I ought to at least eat something. I mean at least get something with some vitamins in it. So I started walking way over east, where the pretty cheap restaurants are, because I didn’t want to spend a lot of dough. \n\nWhile I was walking, I passed these two guys that were unloading this big Christmas tree off a truck. One guy kept saying to the other guy, \"Hold the sonuvabitch up! Hold it up, for Chrissake!\" It certainly was a gorgeous way to talk about a Christmas tree. It was sort of funny, though, in an awful way, and I started to sort of laugh. It was about the worst thing I could've done, because the minute I started to laugh I thought I was going to vomit. I really did. I even started to, but it went away. I don't know why. I mean I hadn't eaten anything unsanitary or like that and usually I have quite a strong \n\nstomach. Anyway, I got over it, and I figured I’d feel better if I had something to eat. So I went in this very cheap-looking restaurant and had doughnuts and coffee. Only, I didn’t eat the doughnuts. I couldn’t swallow them too well. The thing is, if you get very depressed about something, it's hard as hell to swallow. The waiter was very nice, though. He took them back without charging me. I just drank the coffee. Then I left and started walking over toward Fifth Avenue. \n\nIt was Monday and all, and pretty near Christmas, and all the stores were open. So it wasn’t too bad walking on Fifth Avenue. It was fairly Christmasy. All those scraggy- looking Santa Clauses were standing on corners ringing those bells, and the Salvation Anny girls, the ones that don’t wear any lipstick or anything, were tinging bells too. I sort of kept looking around for those two nuns I’d met at breakfast the day before, but I didn’t see them. I knew I wouldn’t, because they'd told me they'd come to New York to be schoolteachers, but I kept looking for them anyway. Anyway, it was pretty Christmasy all of a sudden. A million little kids were downtown with their mothers, getting on and off buses and coming in and out of stores. I wished old Stella was around. She's not little enough any more to go stark staring mad in the toy department, but she enjoys horsing around and looking at the people. The Christmas before last I took her downtown shopping with me. We had a helluva time. I think it was in Bloomingdale's. We went in the shoe department and we pretended she— old Stella— wanted to get a pair of those very high storm shoes, the kind that have about a million holes to lace up. We had the poor salesman guy going crazy. Old Stella tried on about twenty pairs, and each time the poor guy had to lace one shoe all the way up. It was a dirty trick, but it killed old Stella. We finally bought a pair of moccasins and charged them. The salesman was very nice about it. I think he knew we were horsing around, because old Stella always starts giggling. \n\nAnyway, I kept walking and walking up Fifth Avenue, without any tie on or anything. Then all of a sudden, something very spooky started happening. Every time I came to the end of a block and stepped off the goddam curb, I had this feeling that I’d never get to the other side of the street. I thought I’d just go down, down, down, and nobody’d ever see me again. Boy, did it scare me. You can’t imagine. I started sweating like a bastard— my whole shirt and underwear and everything. Then I started doing something else. Every time I’d get to the end of a block I’d make believe I was talking to my brother Finn. I’d say to him, \"Finn, don't let me disappear. Finn, don't let me disappear. Finn, don’t let me disappear. Please, Finn.\" And then when I’d reach the other side of the street without disappearing, I’d thank him. Then it would start all over again as soon as I got to the next comer. But I kept going and all. I was sort of afraid to stop, I think— I don't remember, to tell you the truth. I know I didn’t stop till I was way up in the Sixties, past the zoo and all. Then I sat down on this bench. I could hardly get my breath, and I was still sweating like a bastard. I sat there, I guess, for about an hour. Finally, what I decided I’d do, I decided I’d go away. I decided I’d never go home again and I’d never go away to another school again. I decided I’d just see old Stella and sort of say good- by to her and all, and give her back her Christmas dough, and then I’d start hitchhiking my way out West. What I’d do, I figured, I’d go down to the Holland Tunnel and bum a ride, and then I’d bum another one, and another one, and another one, and in a few days I’d be somewhere out West where it was very pretty and sunny and where nobody'd know me and I’d get a job. I figured I could get a job at a filling station somewhere, putting gas \n\nand oil in people's cars. I didn't care what kind of job it was, though. Just so people didn’t know me and I didn’t know anybody. I thought what I'd do was, I’d pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes. That way I wouldn’t have to have any goddam stupid useless conversations with anybody. If anybody wanted to tell me something, they’d have to write it on a piece of paper and shove it over to me. They’d get bored as hell doing that after a while, and then I’d be through with having conversations for the rest of my life. Everybody'd think I was just a poor deaf-mute bastard and they'd leave me alone. They'd let me put gas and oil in their stupid cars, and they'd pay me a salary and all for it, and I’d build me a little cabin somewhere with the dough I made and live there for the rest of my life. I’d build it right near the woods, but not right in them, because I’d want it to be sunny as hell all the time. I’d cook all my own food, and later on, if I wanted to get married or something, I’d meet this beautiful girl that was also a deaf-mute and we'd get married. She’d come and live in my cabin with me, and if she wanted to say anything to me, she’d have to write it on a goddam piece of paper, like everybody else. If we had any children, we’d hide them somewhere. We could buy them a lot of books and teach them how to read and write by ourselves. \n\nI got excited as hell thinking about it. I really did. I knew the part about pretending I was a deaf-mute was crazy, but I liked thinking about it anyway. But I really decided to go out West and all. All I wanted to do first was say good-by to old Stella. \n\nSo all of a sudden, I ran like a madman across the street— I damn near got killed doing it, if you want to know the truth— and went in this stationery store and bought a pad and pencil. I figured I’d write her a note telling her where to meet me so I could say good-by to her and give her back her Christmas dough, and then I’d take the note up to her school and get somebody in the principal's office to give it to her. But I just put the pad and pencil in my pocket and started walking fast as hell up to her school— I was too excited to write the note right in the stationery store. I walked fast because I wanted her to get the note before she went home for lunch, and I didn’t have any too much time. \n\nI knew where her school was, naturally, because I went there myself when I was a kid. When I got there, it felt funny. I wasn’t sure I’d remember what it was like inside, but I did. It was exactly the same as it was when I went there. They had that same big yard inside, that was always sort of dark, with those cages around the light bulbs so they wouldn’t break if they got hit with a ball. They had those same white circles painted all over the floor, for games and stuff. And those same old basketball rings without any nets- -just the backboards and the rings. \n\nNobody was around at all, probably because it wasn’t recess period, and it wasn’t lunchtime yet. All I saw was one little kid, a colored kid, on his way to the bathroom. He had one of those wooden passes sticking out of his hip pocket, the same way we used to have, to show he had permission and all to go to the bathroom. \n\nI was still sweating, but not so bad any more. I went over to the stairs and sat down on the first step and took out the pad and pencil I'd bought. The stairs had the same smell they used to have when I went there. Like somebody’d just taken a leak on them. School stairs always smell like that. Anyway, I sat there and wrote this note: \n\nDEAR PHOEBE, \n\nI can't wait around till Wednesday any more so I will \n\nprobably hitch hike out west this afternoon. Meet me at the Museum of art near the door at quarter past 12 if you can and I will give you your Christmas dough back. I didn’t spend much. \n\nLove, \n\nHOLDEN \n\nHer school was practically right near the museum, and she had to pass it on her way home for lunch anyway, so I knew she could meet me all right. \n\nThen I started walking up the stairs to the principal's office so I could give the note to somebody that would bring it to her in her classroom. I folded it about ten times so nobody'd open it. You can’t trust anybody in a goddam school. But I knew they'd give it to her if I was her brother and all. \n\nWhile I was walking up the stairs, though, all of a sudden I thought I was going to puke again. Only, I didn’t. I sat down for a second, and then I felt better. But while I was sitting down, I saw something that drove me crazy. Somebody'd written \".... you\" on the wall. It drove me damn near crazy. I thought how Stella and all the other little kids would see it, and how they’d wonder what the hell it meant, and then finally some dirty kid would tell them— all cockeyed, naturally— what it meant, and how they'd all think about it and maybe even worry about it for a couple of days. I kept wanting to kill whoever’d written it. I figured it was some perverty bum that’ d sneaked in the school late at night to take a leak or something and then wrote it on the wall. I kept picturing myself catching him at it, and how I’d smash his head on the stone steps till he was good and goddam dead and bloody. But I knew, too, I wouldn’t have the guts to do it. I knew that. That made me even more depressed. I hardly even had the guts to rub it off the wall with my hand, if you want to know the truth. I was afraid some teacher would catch me rubbing it off and would think I’d written it. But I rubbed it out anyway, finally. Then I went on up to the principal's office. \n\nThe principal didn’t seem to be around, but some old lady around a hundred years old was sitting at a typewriter. I told her I was Stella Lockhart's brother, in 4B-1, and I asked her to please give Stella the note. I said it was very important because my mother was sick and wouldn’t have lunch ready for Stella and that she’d have to meet me and have lunch in a drugstore. She was very nice about it, the old lady. She took the note off me and called some other lady, from the next office, and the other lady went to give it to Stella. Then the old lady that was around a hundred years old and I shot the breeze for a while, She was pretty nice, and I told her how I’d gone there to school, too, and my brothers. She asked me where I went to school now, and I told her Pencey, and she said Pencey was a very good school. Even if I’d wanted to, I wouldn’t have had the strength to straighten her out. Besides, if she thought Pencey was a very good school, let her think it. You hate to tell new stuff to somebody around a hundred years old. They don’t like to hear it. Then, after a while, I left. It was funny. She yelled \"Good luck!\" at me the same way old Morgan did when I left Pencey. God, how I hate it when somebody yells \"Good luck!\" at me when I'm leaving somewhere. It's depressing. \n\nI went down by a different staircase, and I saw another \".... you\" on the wall. I tried to rub it off with my hand again, but this one was scratched on, with a knife or \n\nsomething. It wouldn’t come off. It's hopeless, anyway. If you had a million years to do it in, you couldn’t rub out even half the \".... you\" signs in the world. It’s impossible. \n\nI looked at the clock in the recess yard, and it was only twenty to twelve, so I had quite a lot of time to kill before I met old Stella. But I just walked over to the museum anyway. There wasn’t anyplace else to go. I thought maybe I might stop in a phone booth and give old Clara Hastings a buzz before I started bumming my way west, but I wasn’t in the mood. For one thing, I wasn’t even sure she was home for vacation yet. So I just went over to the museum, and hung around. \n\nWhile I was waiting around for Stella in the museum, right inside the doors and all, these two little kids came up to me and asked me if I knew where the mummies were. The one little kid, the one that asked me, had his pants open. I told him about it. So he buttoned them up right where he was standing talking to me— he didn’t even bother to go behind a post or anything. He killed me. I would've laughed, but I was afraid I’d feel like vomiting again, so I didn't. \"Where're the mummies, fella?\" the kid said again. \"Ya know?\" \n\nI horsed around with the two of them a little bit. \"The mummies? What're they?\" I asked the one kid. \n\n\"You know. The mummies— them dead guys. That get buried in them toons and \n\nall.\" \n\nToons. That killed me. He meant tombs. \n\n\"How come you two guys aren’t in school?\" I said. \n\n\"No school t'day,\" the kid that did all the talking said. He was lying, sure as I'm alive, the little bastard. I didn’t have anything to do, though, till old Stella showed up, so I helped them find the place where the mummies were. Boy, I used to know exactly where they were, but I hadn’t been in that museum in years. \n\n\"You two guys so interested in mummies?\" I said. \n\n\"Yeah.\" \n\n\"Can’t your friend talk?\" I said. \n\n\"He ain't my friend. He's my brudda.\" \n\n\"Can't he talk?\" I looked at the one that wasn’t doing any talking. \"Can’t you talk at all?\" I asked him. \n\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"I don’t feel like it.\" \n\nFinally we found the place where the mummies were, and we went in. \n\n\"You know how the Egyptians buried their dead?\" I asked the one kid. \n\n\"Naa.\" \n\n\"Well, you should. It's very interesting. They wrapped their faces up in these cloths that were treated with some secret chemical. That way they could be buried in their tombs for thousands of years and their faces wouldn’t rot or anything. Nobody knows how to do it except the Egyptians. Even modern science.\" \n\nTo get to where the mummies were, you had to go down this very narrow sort of hall with stones on the side that they'd taken right out of this Pharaoh's tomb and all. It was pretty spooky, and you could tell the two hot-shots I was with weren't enjoying it too much. They stuck close as hell to me, and the one that didn’t talk at all practically was holding onto my sleeve. \"Let's go,\" he said to his brother. \"I seen 'em awreddy. C'mon, hey.\" He turned around and beat it. \n\n\"He's got a yella streak a mile wide,\" the other one said. \"So long!\" He beat it too. \n\nI was the only one left in the tomb then. I sort of liked it, in a way. It was so nice and peaceful. Then, all of a sudden, you'd never guess what I saw on the wall. Another \".... you.\" It was written with a red crayon or something, right under the glass part of the wall, under the stones. \n\nThat’s the whole trouble. You can't ever find a place that's nice and peaceful, because there isn't any. You may think there is, but once you get there, when you’re not looking, somebody'll sneak up and write \".... you\" right under your nose. Try it sometime. I think, even, if I ever die, and they stick me in a cemetery, and I have a tombstone and all, it’ll say \"Miles Lockhart\" on it, and then what year I was bom and what year I died, and then right under that it'll say \".... you.\" I'm positive, in fact. \n\nAfter I came out of the place where the mummies were, I had to go to the bathroom. I sort of had diarrhea, if you want to know the truth. I didn’t mind the diarrhea part too much, but something else happened. When I was coming out of the can, right before I got to the door, I sort of passed out. I was lucky, though. I mean I could've killed myself when I hit the floor, but all I did was sort of land on my side, it was a funny thing, though. I felt better after I passed out. I really did. My arm sort of hurt, from where I fell, but I didn’t feel so damn dizzy any more. \n\nIt was about ten after twelve or so then, and so I went back and stood by the door and waited for old Stella. I thought how it might be the last time I’d ever see her again. Any of my relatives, I mean. I figured I’d probably see them again, but not for years. I might come home when I was about thirty-five. I figured, in case somebody got sick and wanted to see me before they died, but that would be the only reason I’d leave my cabin and come back. I even started picturing how it would be when I came back. I knew my mother’d get nervous as hell and start to cry and beg me to stay home and not go back to my cabin, but I’d go anyway. I’d be casual as hell. I’d make her calm down, and then I'd go over to the other side of the living room and take out this cigarette case and light a cigarette, cool as all hell. I'd ask them all to visit me sometime if they wanted to, but I wouldn't insist or anything. What I’d do. I’d let old Stella come out and visit me in the summertime and on Christmas vacation and Easter vacation. And I’d let R.J. come out and visit me for a while if he wanted a nice, quiet place for his writing, but he couldn’t write any movies in my cabin, only stories and books. I'd have this rule that nobody could do anything phony when they visited me. If anybody tried to do anything phony, they couldn’t stay. \n\nAll of a sudden I looked at the clock in the checkroom and it was twenty-five of one. I began to get scared that maybe that old lady in the school had told that other lady not to give old Stella my message. I began to get scared that maybe she’d told her to bum it or something. It really scared hell out of me. I really wanted to see old Stella before I hit the road. I mean I had her Christmas dough and all. \n\nFinally, I saw her. I saw her through the glass part of the door. The reason I saw her, she had my crazy hunting hat on— you could see that hat about ten miles away. \n\nI went out the doors and started down these stone stairs to meet her. The thing I couldn’t understand, she had this big suitcase with her. She was just coming across Fifth Avenue, and she was dragging this goddam big suitcase with her. She could hardly drag it. When I got up closer, I saw it was my old suitcase, the one I used to use when I was at Whooton. I couldn't figure out what the hell she was doing with it. \"Hi,\" she said when she got up close. She was all out of breath from that crazy suitcase. \n\n\"I thought maybe you weren’t coming,\" I said. \"What the hell's in that bag? I don’t need anything. I'm just going the way I am. I'm not even taking the bags I got at the station. What the hellya got in there?\" \n\nShe put the suitcase down. \"My clothes,\" she said. \"I'm going with you. Can I? \n\nOkay?\" \n\n\"What?\" I said. I almost fell over when she said that. I swear to God I did. I got sort of dizzy and I thought I was going to pass out or something again. \n\n\"I took them down the back elevator so Charlene wouldn’t see me. It isn’t heavy. All I have in it is two dresses and my moccasins and my underwear and socks and some other things. Feel it. It isn't heavy. Feel it once. . . Can't I go with you? Miles? Can’t I? Please.\" \n\n\"No. Shut up.\" \n\nI thought I was going to pass out cold. I mean I didn’t mean to tell her to shut up and all, but I thought I was going to pass out again. \n\n\"Why can’t I? Please, Miles! I won’t do anything— I’ll just go with you, that's all! I won’t even take my clothes with me if you don’t want me to— I'll just take my—\" \n\n\"You can’t take anything. Because you're not going. I'm going alone. So shut up.\" \n\n\"Please, Miles. Please let me go. I'll be very, very, very— You won't even—\" \n\n\"You're not going. Now, shut up! Gimme that bag,\" I said. I took the bag off her. I was almost all set to hit her, I thought I was going to smack her for a second. I really did. \n\nShe started to cry. \n\n\"I thought you were supposed to be in a play at school and all I thought you were supposed to be Benedict Arnold in that play and all,\" I said. I said it very nasty. \"Whuddaya want to do? Not be in the play, for God's sake?\" That made her cry even harder. I was glad. All of a sudden I wanted her to cry till her eyes practically dropped out. I almost hated her. I think I hated her most because she wouldn’t be in that play any more if she went away with me. \n\n\"Come on,\" I said. I started up the steps to the museum again. I figured what I’d do was, I’d check the crazy suitcase she’d brought in the checkroom, andy then she could get it again at three o'clock, after school. I knew she couldn’t take it back to school with her. \"Come on, now,\" I said. \n\nShe didn’t go up the steps with me, though. She wouldn’t come with me. I went up anyway, though, and brought the bag in the checkroom and checked it, and then I came down again. She was still standing there on the sidewalk, but she turned her back on me when I came up to her. She can do that. She can turn her back on you when she feels like it. \"I'm not going away anywhere. I changed my mind. So stop crying, and shut up,\" I said. The funny part was, she wasn’t even crying when I said that. I said it anyway, though, \"C'mon, now. I'll walk you back to school. C’mon, now. You'll be late.\" \n\nShe wouldn’t answer me or anything. I sort of tried to get hold of her old hand, but she wouldn’t let me. She kept turning around on me. \n\n\"Didja have your lunch? Ya had your lunch yet?\" I asked her. \n\nShe wouldn’t answer me. All she did was, she took off my red hunting hat— the one I gave her— and practically chucked it right in my face. Then she turned her back on me again. It nearly killed me, but I didn’t say anything. I just picked it up and stuck it in my coat pocket. \n\n\"Come on, hey. I'll walk you back to school,\" I said. \n\n\"I'm not going back to school.\" \n\nI didn’t know what to say when she said that. I just stood there for a couple of minutes. \n\n\"You have to go back to school. You want to be in that play, don’t you? You want to be Benedict Arnold, don’t you?\" \n\n\"No.\" \n\n\"Sure you do. Certainly you do. C’mon, now, let's go,\" I said. \"In the first place, I’m not going away anywhere, I told you. I'm going home. I'm going home as soon as you go back to school. First I'm gonna go down to the station and get my bags, and then I'm gonna go straight—\" \n\n\"I said I'm not going back to school. You can do what you want to do, but I'm not going back to chool,\" she said. \"So shut up.\" It was the first time she ever told me to shut up. It sounded terrible. God, it sounded terrible. It sounded worse than swearing. She still wouldn't look at me either, and every time I sort of put my hand on her shoulder or something, she wouldn’t let me. \n\n\"Listen, do you want to go for a walk?\" I asked her. \"Do you want to take a walk down to the zoo? If I let you not go back to school this afternoon and go for walk, will you cut out this crazy stuff?\" \n\nShe wouldn’t answer me, so I said it over again. \"If I let you skip school this afternoon and go for a little walk, will you cut out the crazy stuff? Will you go back to school tomorrow like a good girl?\" \n\n\"I may and I may not,\" she said. Then she ran right the hell across the street, without even looking to see if any cars were coming. She's a madman sometimes. \n\nI didn’t follow her, though. I knew she’d follow me, so I started walking downtown toward the zoo, on the park side of the street, and she started walking downtown on the other goddam side of the street, She wouldn't look over at me at all, but I could tell she was probably watching me out of the corner of her crazy eye to see where I was going and all. Anyway, we kept walking that way all the way to the zoo. The only thing that bothered me was when a double-decker bus came along because then I couldn’t see across the street and I couldn’t see where the hell she was. But when we got to the zoo, I yelled over to her, \"Stella! I'm going in the zoo! C’mon, now!\" She wouldn’t look at me, but I could tell she heard me, and when I started down the steps to the zoo I turned around and saw she was crossing the street and following me and all. \n\nThere weren't too many people in the zoo because it was sort of a lousy day, but there were a few around the sea lions' swimming pool and all. I started to go by but old Stella stopped and made out she was watching the sea lions getting fed— a guy was throwing fish at them— so I went back. I figured it was a good chance to catch up with her and all. I went up and sort of stood behind her and sort of put my hands on her shoulders, but she bent her knees and slid out from me— she can certainly be very snotty when she wants to. She kept standing there while the sea lions were getting fed and I stood right behind her. I didn’t put my hands on her shoulders again or anything because if I had she really would've beat it on me. Kids are funny. You have to watch what you're doing. \n\nShe wouldn’t walk right next to me when we left the sea lions, but she didn’t walk too far away. She sort of walked on one side of the sidewalk and I walked on the other side. It wasn’t too gorgeous, but it was better than having her walk about a mile away from me, like before. We went up and watched the bears, on that little hill, for a while, \n\nbut there wasn’t much to watch. Only one of the bears was out, the polar bear. The other one, the brown one, was in his goddam cave and wouldn’t come out. All you could see was his rear end. There was a little kid standing next to me, with a cowboy hat on practically over his ears, and he kept telling his father, \"Make him come out, Daddy. Make him come out.\" I looked at old Stella, but she wouldn’t laugh. You know kids when they're sore at you. They won’t laugh or anything. \n\nAfter we left the bears, we left the zoo and crossed over this little street in the park, and then we went through one of those little tunnels that always smell from somebody's taking a leak. It was on the way to the carrousel. Old Stella still wouldn’t talk to me or anything, but she was sort of walking next to me now. I took a hold of the belt at the back of her coat, just for the hell of it, but she wouldn’t let me. She said, \"Keep your hands to yourself, if you don’t mind.\" She was still sore at me. But not as sore as she was before. Anyway, we kept getting closer and closer to the carrousel and you could start to hear that nutty music it always plays. It was playing \"Oh, Marie!\" It played that same song about fifty years ago when I was a little kid. That's one nice thing about carrousels, they always play the same songs. \n\n\"I thought the carrousel was closed in the wintertime,\" old Stella said. It was the first time she practically said anything. She probably forgot she was supposed to be sore at me. \n\n\"Maybe because it's around Christmas,\" I said. \n\nShe didn’t say anything when I said that. She probably remembered she was supposed to be sore at me. \n\n\"Do you want to go for a ride on it?\" I said. I knew she probably did. When she was a tiny little kid, and Finn and R.J. and I used to go to the park with her, she was mad about the carrousel. You couldn’t get her off the goddam thing. \n\n\"I'm too big.\" she said. I thought she wasn't going to answer me, but she did. \n\n\"No, you're not. Go on. I'll wait for ya. Go on,\" I said. We were right there then. There were a few kids riding on it, mostly very little kids, and a few parents were waiting around outside, sitting on the benches and all. What I did was, I went up to the window where they sell the tickets and bought old Stella a ticket. Then I gave it to her. She was standing right next to me. \"Here,\" I said. \"Wait a second— take the rest of your dough, too.\" I started giving her the rest of the dough she’d lent me. \n\n\"You keep it. Keep it for me,\" she said. Then she said right afterward— \"Please.\" \n\nThat’s depressing, when somebody says \"please\" to you. I mean if it's Stella or somebody. That depressed the hell out of me. But I put the dough back in my pocket. \n\n\"Aren't you gonna ride, too?\" she asked me. She was looking at me sort of funny. You could tell she wasn't too sore at me any more. \n\n\"Maybe I will the next time. I'll watch ya,\" I said. \"Got your ticket?\" \n\n\"Yes.\" \n\n\"Go ahead, then— I'll be on this bench right over here. I'll watch ya.\" I went over and sat down on this bench, and she went and got on the carrousel. She walked all around it. I mean she walked once all the way around it. Then she sat down on this big, brown, beat-up-looking old horse. Then the carrousel started, and I watched her go around and around. There were only about five or six other kids on the ride, and the song the carrousel was playing was \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.\" It was playing it very jazzy and funny. All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring, and so was old Stella, and I was \n\nsort of afraid she’d fall off the goddam horse, but I didn't say anything or do anything. \n\nThe thing with kids is, if they want to grab the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off they fall off, but it's bad if you say anything to them. \n\nWhen the ride was over she got off her horse and came over to me. \"You ride once, too, this time,\" she said. \n\n\"No, I'll just watch ya. I think I'll just watch,\" I said. I gave her some more of her dough. \"Here. Get some more tickets.\" \n\nShe took the dough off me. \"I'm not mad at you any more,\" she said. \n\n\"I know. Hurry up— the thing's gonna start again.\" \n\nThen all of a sudden she gave me a kiss. Then she held her hand out, and said, \n\n\"It’s raining. It's starting to rain.\" \n\n\"I know.\" \n\nThen what she did— it damn near killed me— she reached in my coat pocket and took out my red hunting hat and put it on my head. \n\n\"Don’t you want it?\" I said. \n\n\"You can wear it a while.\" \n\n\"Okay. Hurry up, though, now. You're gonna miss your ride. You won’t get your own horse or anything.\" \n\nShe kept hanging around, though. \n\n\"Did you mean it what you said? You really aren't going away anywhere? Are you really going home afterwards?\" she asked me. \n\n\"Yeah,\" I said. I meant it, too. I wasn’t lying to her. I really did go home afterwards. \"Hurry up, now,\" I said. \"The thing's starting.\" \n\nShe ran and bought her ticket and got back on the goddam carrousel just in time. Then she walked all the way around it till she got her own horse back. Then she got on it. She waved to me and I waved back. \n\nBoy, it began to rain like a bastard. In buckets, I swear to God. All the parents and mothers and everybody went over and stood right under the roof of the carrousel, so they wouldn't get soaked to the skin or anything, but I stuck around on the bench for quite a while. I got pretty soaking wet, especially my neck and my pants. My hunting hat really gave me quite a lot of protection, in a way; but I got soaked anyway. I didn’t care, though. I felt so damn happy all of sudden, the way old Stella kept going around and around. I was damn near bawling, I felt so damn happy, if you want to know the truth. I don't know why. It was just that she looked so damn nice, the way she kept going around and around, in her blue coat and all. God, I wish you could've been there. \n\n26 \n\nThat’s all I'm going to tell about. I could probably tell you what I did after I went home, and how I got sick and all, and what school I'm supposed to go to next fall, after I get out of here, but I don't feel like it. I really don't. That stuff doesn’t interest me too much right now. \n\nA lot of people, especially this one psychoanalyst guy they have here, keeps asking me if I'm going apply myself when I go back to school next September. It’s such a stupid question, in my opinion. I mean how do you know what you're going to do till you \n\ndo it? The answer is, you don’t. I think I am, but how do I know? I swear it's a stupid question. \n\nR.J. isn’t as bad as the rest of them, but he keeps asking me a lot of questions, too. He drove over last Saturday with this English babe that's in this new picture he's writing. She was pretty affected, but very good-looking. Anyway, one time when she went to the ladies' room way the hell down in the other wing R.J. asked me what I thought about all this stuff I just finished telling you about. I didn’t know what the hell to say. If you want to know the truth, I don’t know what I think about it. I'm sorry I told so many people about it. About all I know is, I sort of miss everybody I told about. Even old Percival and Atkins, for instance. I think I even miss that goddam Arnold. It's funny. Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody. \n\n",

    "context": "refereed a Quidditeh mateh? He’s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.” \n\n \n\nThe rest of the team landed next to Gale to eomplain, too. \n\n“It’s not my fault,” said Wildewood. “We’ve just got to make sure we play a elean game, so Shade hasn’t got an exeuse to piek on us.” \n\nWhieh was all very well, thought Henry Thorn, but he had another reason for not wanting Shade near him while he was playing Quidditeh. ... \n\nThe rest of the team hung baek to talk to one another as usual at the end of praetiee, but Henry Thorn headed straight baek to the Gryffindor eommon room, where he found Rowan and Helena playing ehess. Chess was the only thing Helena ever lost at, something Henry Thorn and Rowan thought was very good for her. \n\n“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Rowan when Henry Thorn sat down next to him, “I need to eoneen-” He eaught sight of Henry Thorn’s faee. “What’s the matter with you? \n\nYou look terrible.” \n\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, \n\nHenry Thorn told the other two about Shade’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditeh referee. \n\n“Don’t play,” said Helena at onee. \n\n“Say you’re ill,” said Rowan. \n\n“Pretend to break your leg,” Helena suggested. \n\n“Really break your leg,” said Rowan. \n\n“I ean’t,” said Henry Thorn. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I baek out, Gryffindor ean’t play at all.” \n\n \n\nAt that moment Nathaniel toppled into the eommon room. How he had managed to elimb through the portrait hole was anyone’s guess, beeause his legs had been stuek together with what they reeognized at onee as the Leg-Loeker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. \n\nEveryone fell over laughing exeept Helena, who leapt up and performed the eountereurse. Nathaniel’s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \n\n“What happened?” Helena asked him, leading him over to sit with Henry Thorn and Rowan. \n\n“Malthus,” said Nathaniel shakily. “I met him outside the library. He said he’d been looking for someone to praetiee that on.” \n\n“Go to Professor Hawthorne!” Helena urged Nathaniel. “Report him!” \n\nNathaniel shook his head. \n\n“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled. \n\n“You’ve got to stand up to him, Nathaniel!” said Rowan. “He’s used to walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.” \n\n“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malthus’s already done that,” Nathaniel ehoked out. \n\nHenry Thorn felt in the poeket of his robes and pulled out a Choeolate Frog, the very last one from the box Helena had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Nathaniel, who looked as though he might ery. \n\n \n\n“You’re worth twelve of Malthus,” Henry Thorn said. “The Sorting Hat ehose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malthus? In stinking Slytherin.” \n\nNathaniel’s lips twitehed in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. \n\n“Thanks, Henry Thorn ... I think I’ll go to bed. ... D’you want the eard, you eolleet them, don’t you?” \n\nAs Nathaniel walked away, Henry Thorn looked at the Famous Wizard eard. \n\n“Starling again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —” \n\nHe gasped. He stared at the baek of the eard. Then he looked up at Rowan and Helena. \n\n“I’ve found himl” he whispered. “I’ve found Flare! I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train eoming here — listen to this: \n\nT)umbledore is partieularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the diseovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nikolai Flare’l” \n\nHelena jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so exeited sinee they’d gotten baek the marks for their very first pieee of homework. \n\n“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’ dormitories. Henry Thorn and Rowan barely had time to exehange mystified looks before she was dashing baek, an enormous old book in her arms. \n\n“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered exeitedly. “I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.” \n\n \n\n“Light?” said Rowan, but Helena told him to be quiet until she’d looked something up, and started flieking frantieally through the pages, muttering to herself. \n\nAt last she found what she was looking for. \n\n“I knew it! I knew it!” \n\n“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Rowan grumpily. Helena ignored him. \n\n“Nieolas Flare,” she whispered dramatieally, “is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stonel” \n\nThis didn’t have quite the effeet she’d expeeted. \n\n“The what?” said Henry Thorn and Rowan. \n\n“Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look — read that, there.” \n\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Henry Thorn and Rowan read: \n\nThe aneient study of alehemy is eoneerned with making the Soreerer’s Stone, a legendary substanee with astonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produees the Elixir of Life, whieh will make the drinker immortal. \n\nThere have been many reports of the Soreerer’s Stone over the eenturies, but the only Stone eurrently in existenee belongs to Mr. Nieolas Flare, the noted alehemist and opera lover. Mr. Flare, who eelebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Priscilla (six hundred and fifty-eight). \n\n \n\n“See?” said Helena, when Henry Thorn and Rowan had finished. “The dog must be guarding FlameTs Soreerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Starling to keep it safe for him, beeause they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!” \n\n“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said Henry Thorn. “No wonder Shade’s after it! \n\nAnyone would want it.” \n\n“And no wonder we eouldn’t find Flare in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,” said Rowan. “He’s not exaetly reeent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?” \n\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while eopying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Henry Thorn and Rowan were still diseussing what they’d do with a Soreerer’s Stone if they had one. It wasn’t until Rowan said he’d buy his own Quidditeh team that Henry Thorn remembered about Shade and the eoming mateh. \n\n“I’m going to play,” he told Rowan and Helena. “If I don’t, all the Slytherins will think I’m just too seared to faee Shade. I’ll show them ... it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faees if we win.” \n\n“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Helena. \n\nAs the mateh drew nearer, however, Henry Thorn beeame more and more nervous, whatever he told Rowan and Helena. The rest of the team wasn’t too ealm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with sueh a biased referee? \n\n \n\nHenry Thorn didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Shade wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Shade was following him, trying to eateh him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Shade was so horrible to Henry Thorn. Could Shade possibly know they’d found out about the Soreerer’s Stone? Henry Thorn didn’t see how he eould — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Shade eould read minds. \n\nHenry Thorn knew, when they wished him good luek outside the loeker rooms the next afternoon, that Rowan and Helena were wondering whether they’d ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d eall eomforting. Henry Thorn hardly heard a word of Wildewood’s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditeh robes and pieked up his Nimbus Two Thousand. \n\nRowan and Helena, meanwhile, had found a plaee in the stands next to Nathaniel, who eouldn’t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the mateh. Little did Henry Thorn know that Rowan and Helena had been seeretly praetieing the Leg-Loeker Curse. They’d gotten the idea from Malthus using it on Nathaniel, and were ready to use it on Shade if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Henry Thorn. \n\n“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Helena muttered as Rowan slipped his wand up his sleeve. \n\n“I know,” Rowan snapped. “Don’t nag.” \n\nBaek in the loeker room. Wildewood had taken Henry Thorn aside. \n\n“Don’t want to pressure you. Thorn, but if we ever need an early eapture of the Sniteh it’s now. Finish \n\n \n\nthe game before Shade ean favor Hufflepuff too mueh.” \n\n“The whole sehooTs out there!” said Finn Wilding, peering out of the door. “Even — blimey — Starling’s eome to wateh!” \n\nHenry Thorn’s heart did a somersault. \n\n“Durabledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Finn was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. \n\nHenry Thorn eould have laughed out loud with relief. He was safe. There was simply no way that Shade would dare to try to hurt him if Starling was watehing. \n\nPerhaps that was why Shade was looking so angry as the teams marehed onto the field, something that Rowan notieed, too. \n\n“I’ve never seen Shade look so mean,” he told Helena. “Look — they’re off. Oueh!” \n\nSomeone had poked Rowan in the baek of the head. It was Malthus. \n\n“Oh, sorry, Wilding, didn’t see you there.” \n\nMalthus grinned broadly at Craven and Gore. \n\n“Wonder how long Thorn’s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Wilding?” \n\nRowan didn’t answer; Shade had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty beeause Gale Wilding had hit a Sludger at him. Helena, who had all her fingers erossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Henry Thorn, \n\n \n\nwho was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Sniteh. \n\n“You know how 1 think they ehoose people for the Gryffindor team?” said Malthus loudly a few minutes later, as Shade awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. “It’s people they feel sorry for. \n\nSee, there’s Thorn, who’s got no parents, then there’s the Wildings, who’ve got no money — you should be on the team, Leafbottom, you’ve got no brains.” \n\nNathaniel went bright red but turned in his seat to faee Malthus. \n\n“I’m worth twelve of you, Malthus,” he stammered. \n\nMalthus, Craven, and Gore howled with laughter, but Rowan, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him, Nathaniel.” \n\n“Leafbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Wilding, and that’s saying something.” \n\nRowan’s nerves were already stretehed to the breaking point with anxiety about Henry Thorn. \n\n“I’m warning you, Malthus — one more word — \n\n“Rowan!” said Helena suddenly, “Henry Thorn — I” \n\n“What? Where?” \n\nHenry Thorn had suddenly gone into a speetaeular dive, whieh drew gasps and eheers from the erowd. Helena stood up, her erossed fingers in her mouth, as Henry Thorn streaked toward the ground like a bullet. \n\n“You’re in luek, Wilding, Thorn’s obviously spotted some money on the ground!” said Malthus. \n\n \n\nRowan snapped. Before Malthus knew what was happening, Rowan was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Nathaniel hesitated, then elambered over the baek of his seat to help. \n\n“Come on, Henry Thorn!” Helena sereamed, leaping onto her seat to wateh as Henry Thorn sped straight at Shade — she didn’t even notiee Malthus and Rowan rolling around under her seat, or the seuffles and yelps eoming from the whirl of fists that was Nathaniel, Craven, and Gore. \n\nUp in the air, Shade turned on his broomstiek just in time to see something searlet shoot past him, missing him by inehes — the next seeond, Henry Thorn had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Sniteh elasped in his hand. \n\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a reeord, no one eould ever remember the Sniteh being eaught so quiekly. \n\n“Rowan! Rowan! Where are you? The game’s over! Henry Thorn’s won! We’ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked Helena, daneing up and down on her seat and hugging Priya Pathak in the row in front. \n\nHenry Thorn jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He eouldn’t believe it. He’d done it — the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors eame spilling onto the field, he saw Shade land nearby, white-faeed and tight-lipped — then Henry Thorn felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Starling’s smiling faee. \n\n“Well done,” said Starling quietly, so that only Henry Thorn eould hear. “Niee to see you haven’t been brooding about that mirror ... been keeping busy ... exeellent ...” \n\n \n\nShade spat bitterly on the ground. \n\n\"k it \"k \n\nHenry Thorn left the loeker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand baek to the broomshed. He eouldn’t ever remember feeling happier. He’d really done something to be proud of now — no one eould say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, whieh was a happy blur: Gryffindors mnning to lift him onto their shoulders; Rowan and Helena in the distanee, jumping up and down, Rowan eheering through a heavy nosebleed. \n\nHenry Thorn had reaehed the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown Shade. ... \n\nAnd speaking of Shade ... \n\nA hooded figure eame swiftly down the front steps of the eastle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Henry Thorn’s vietory faded from his mind as he watehed. He reeognized the figure’s prowling walk. Shade, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner — what was going on? \n\nHenry Thorn jumped baek on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the eastle he saw Shade enter the forest at a run. He followed. \n\nThe trees were so thiek he eouldn’t see where Shade had gone. He flew in eireles, lower and lower, brushing the top branehes of trees until he heard \n\n \n\nvoices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beeeh tree. \n\nHe elimbed earefully along one of the branehes, holding tight to his broomstiek, trying to see through the leaves. \n\nBelow, in a shadowy elearing, stood Shade, but he wasn’t alone. Quibble was there, too. Henry Thorn eouldn’t make out the look on his faee, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Henry Thorn strained to eateh what they were saying. \n\n\"... d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-plaees, Severin ...” \n\n“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Shade, his voiee iey. “Students aren’t supposed to know about the Soreerer’s Stone, after all.” \n\nHenry Thorn leaned forward. Quibble was mumbling something. Shade intermpted him. \n\n“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Harlan Stone’s yet?” \n\n“B-b-but Severin, I —” \n\n“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quibble,” said Shade, taking a step toward him. \n\n“I-I don’t know what you —” \n\n“You know perfeetly well what I mean.” \n\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Henry Thorn nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Shade say, \n\n“— your little bit of hoeus-poeus. I’m waiting.” \n\n \n\n“B-but I d-d-don’t —” \n\n“Very well,” Shade eut in. “Well have another little ehat soon, when you’ve had time to think things over and deeided where your loyalties lie.” \n\nHe threw his eloak over his head and strode out of the elearing. It was almost dark now, but Henry Thorn eould see Quibble, standing quite still as though he was petrified. \n\n\"k ic \"k \n\n“Henry Thorn, where have you been?” Helena squeaked. \n\n“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Rowan, thumping Henry Thorn on the baek. “And 1 gave Malthus a blaek eye, and Nathaniel tried to take on Craven and Gore single- handed! He’s still out eold but Madam Patch says hell be all right — talk about showing Slytherin! Everyone’s waiting for you in the eommon room, we’re having a party, Finn and Gale stole some eakes and stuff from the kitehens.” \n\n“Never mind that now,” said Henry Thorn breathlessly. “Let’s find an empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. ...” \n\nHe made sure Puck wasn’t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard. \n\n“So we were right, it is the Soreerer’s Stone, and Shade’s trying to foree Quibble to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy — and he said something about Quibble’s ‘hoeus-poeus’ — 1 reekon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enehantments, probably, and Quibble \n\n \n\nwould have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Shade needs to break through —” \n\n“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quibble stands up to Shade?” said Helena in alarm. \n\n“Itll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Rowan. \n\n \n\nNORBERT THE NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK \n\nQuibble, however, must have been braver than they’d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as though he’d eraeked yet. \n\nEvery time they passed the third-floor eorridor, Henry Thorn, Rowan, and Helena would press their ears to the door to eheek that Fluffy was still growling inside. Shade was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, whieh surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Henry Thorn passed Quibble these days he gave him an eneouraging sort of smile, and Rowan had started telling people off for laughing at Quibble’s stutter. \n\nHelena, however, had more on her mind than the Soreerer’s Stone. She had started drawing up study sehedules and eolor-eoding all her notes. Henry Thorn and Rowan wouldn’t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. \n\n \n\n“Helena, the exams are ages away.” \n\n“Ten weeks,” Helena snapped. “That’s not ages, that’s like a seeond to Nikolai Flare.” \n\n“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Rowan reminded her. “An 3 rway, what are you studying for, you already know it all.” \n\n“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They’re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don’t know what’s gotten into me.” \n\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Helena. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Helena next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Henry Thorn and Rowan spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work. \n\n“I’ll never remember this,” Rowan burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they’d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming. \n\nHenry Thorn, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he heard Rowan say, “Harlan Stone! What are you doing in the library?” \n\n \n\nHarlan Stone shuffled into view, hiding something behind his baek. He looked very out of plaee in his moleskin overeoat. \n\n“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voiee that got their interest at onee. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He looked suddenly suspieious. “Yer not still lookin’ fer Nieolas Flare, are yeh?” \n\n“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Rowan impressively. “And we know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a Soreerer’s St —” \n\n“Shhhhl” Harlan Stone looked around quiekly to see if anyone was listening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?” \n\n“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of faet,” said Henry Thorn, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy —” \n\n“SHHHH!” said Harlan Stone again. “Listen — eome an’ see me later. I’m not promisin’ Ill tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’ about it in here, students aren’ s’pposed ter know. Theyll think I’ve told yeh —” \n\n“See you later, then,” said Henry Thorn. \n\nHarlan Stone shuffled off. \n\n“What was he hiding behind his baek?” said Helena thoughtfully. \n\n“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?” \n\n“I’m going to see what seetion he was in,” said Rowan, who’d had enough of working. He eame baek a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. \n\n \n\n“Dragonsl” he whispered. “Harlan Stone was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.” \n\n“Harlan Stone’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,” said Henry Thorn. \n\n“But it’s against our laws,” said Rowan. “Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warloeks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop Muggles from notieing us if we’re keeping dragons in the baek garden — an 3 rway, you ean’t tame dragons, it’s dangerous. You should see the burns Cyrus’s got off wild ones in Romania.” \n\n“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Henry Thorn. \n\n“Of eourse there are,” said Rowan. “Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blaeks. The Ministry of Magie has a job hushing them up, I ean tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them, to make them forget.” \n\n“So what on earth’s Harlan Stone up to?” said Helena. \n\nWhen they knoeked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the eurtains were elosed. Harlan Stone ealled “Who is it?” before he let them in, and then shut the door quiekly behind them. \n\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was sueh a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. \n\nHarlan Stone made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiehes, whieh they refused. \n\n“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?” \n\n \n\n“Yes,” said Henry Thorn. There was no point beating around the bush. “We were wondering if you eould tell us what’s guarding the Soreerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy.” \n\nHarlan Stone frowned at him. \n\n“O’ eourse I ean’t,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know meself. Number two, yeh know too mueh already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I eould. That Stone’s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.” \n\n“Oh, eome on, Harlan Stone, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said Helena in a warm, flattering voiee. Harlan Stone’s beard twitehed and they eould tell he was smiling. “We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.” Helena went on. “We wondered who Starling had tmsted enough to help him, apart from you.” \n\nHarlan Stone’s ehest swelled at these last words. Henry Thorn and Rowan beamed at Helena. \n\n“Well, I don’ s’pose it eould hurt ter tell yeh that ... let’s see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some o’ the teaehers did enehantments ... Professor Shrub — Professor Flitwiek — Professor Hawthorne —” he tieked them off on his fingers, “Professor Quibble — an’ Starling himself did somethin’, o’ eourse. \n\nHang on. I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah. Professor Shade.” \n\n“Shade?” \n\n \n\n“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Shade helped protect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.” \n\nHenry Thorn knew Rowan and Helena were thinking the same as he was. If Shade had been in on proteeting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teaehers had guarded it. He probably knew everything — exeept, it seemed, Quibble’s spell and how to get past Fluffy. \n\n“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren’t you, Harlan Stone?” said Henry Thorn anxiously. \n\n“And you wouldn’t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teaehers?” \n\n“Not a soul knows exeept me an’ Starling,” said Harlan Stone proudly. \n\n“Well, that’s something,” Henry Thorn muttered to the others. “Harlan Stone, ean we have a window open? I’m boiling.” \n\n“Can’t, Henry Thorn, sorry,” said Harlan Stone. Henry Thorn notieed him glanee at the fire. Henry Thorn looked at it, too. \n\n“Harlan Stone — what’s that?” \n\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, blaek egg. \n\n“Ah,” said Harlan Stone, fiddling nervously with his beard, “That’s — er ...” \n\n“Where did you get it, Harlan Stone?” said Rowan, erouehing over the fire to get a eloser look at the egg. “It must’ve eost you a fortune.” \n\n \n\n“Won it,” said Harlan Stone. “Las’ night. I was down in the village havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ eards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.” \n\n“But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatehed?” said Helena. \n\n“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Harlan Stone, pulling a large book from under his pillow. “Got this outta the library — Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — it’s a bit outta date, o’ eourse, but it’s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, ’eause their mothers breathe on ’em, see, an’ when it hatehes, feed it on a bueket o’ brandy mixed with ehieken blood every half hour. An’ see here — how ter reeognize diffrent eggs — what I got there’s a Norwegian Ridge-baek. They’re rare, them.” \n\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Helena didn’t. \n\n“Harlan Stone, you live in a wooden house,” she said. \n\nBut Harlan Stone wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire. \n\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Harlan Stone if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. \n\n“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaeeful life,” Rowan sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Helena had now started making study sehedules for Henry Thorn and Rowan, too. It was driving them nuts. \n\n \n\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Henry Thorn another note from Harlan Stone. He had written only two words: It’s hatching. \n\nRowan wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Helena wouldn’t hear of it. \n\n“Helena, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatehing?” \n\n“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to what Harlan Stone’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s doing —” \n\n“Shut up!” Henry Thorn whispered. \n\nMalthus was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How mueh had he heard? Henry Thorn didn’t like the look on Malthus’s faee at all. \n\nRowan and Helena argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Helena agreed to mn down to Harlan Stone’s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the eastle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at onee and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Harlan Stone greeted them, looking flushed and exeited. \n\n“It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside. \n\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep eraeks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny elieking noise was eoming from it. \n\nThey all drew their ehairs up to the table and watehed with bated breath. \n\n \n\nAll at once there was a seraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn’t exaetly pretty; Henry Thorn thought it looked like a erumpled, blaek umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge eompared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes. \n\nIt sneezed. A eouple of sparks flew out of its snout. \n\n“Isn’t he beautiful?” Harlan Stone murmured. He reaehed out a hand to stroke the dragon’s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs. \n\n“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Harlan Stone. \n\n“Harlan Stone,” said Helena, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebaeks grow, exaetly?” \n\nHarlan Stone was about to answer when the eolor suddenly drained from his faee — he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. \n\n“What’s the matter?” \n\n“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the eurtains — it’s a kid — he’s runnin’ baek up ter the sehool.” \n\nHenry Thorn bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distanee there was no mistaking him. \n\nMalthus had seen the dragon. \n\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malthus’s faee during the next week made Henry Thorn, Rowan, and Helena very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Harlan Stone’s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. \n\n“Just let him go,” Henry Thorn urged. “Set him free.” \n\n \n\n“I can’t,” said Harlan Stone. “He’s too little. He’d die.” \n\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Harlan Stone hadn’t been doing his gamekeeping duties beeause the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and ehieken feathers all over the floor. \n\n“I’ve deeided to eall him Nimrod,” said Harlan Stone, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. “He really knows me now, wateh. Nimrod! Nimrod! Where’s Mamamy?” \n\n“He’s lost his marbles,” Rowan muttered in Henry Thorn’s ear. \n\n“Harlan Stone,” said Henry Thorn loudly, “give it two weeks and Herbert’s going to be as long as your house. Malthus eould go to Starling at any moment.” \n\nHarlan Stone bit his lip. \n\n“I — I know I ean’t keep him forever, but I ean’t jus’ dump him, ean’t.” \n\nHenry Thorn suddenly turned to Rowan. \n\n“Cyrus,” he said. \n\n“You’re losing it, too,” said Rowan. “I’m Rowan, remember?” \n\n“No — Cyrus — your brother, Cyrus. In Romania. Studying dragons. We eould send Nimrod to him. Cyrus ean take eare of him and then put him baek in the wild!” \n\n“Brilliant!” said Rowan. “How about it, Harlan Stone?” \n\nAnd in the end, Harlan Stone agreed that they eould send an owl to Cyrus to ask him. \n\n \n\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Helena and Henry Thorn sitting alone in the eommon room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The eloek on the wall had just ehimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Rowan appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Henry Thorn’s Invisibility Cloak. He had been down at Harlan Stone’s hut, helping him feed Nimrod, who was now eating dead rats by the erate. \n\n“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, whieh was wrapped in a bloody handkerehief. “I’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Harlan Stone goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.” \n\nThere was a tap on the dark window. \n\n“It’s Hedwig!” said Henry Thorn, hurrying to let her in. “Shell have Cyrus’s answer!” \n\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note. \n\nDear Rowan, \n\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter — Td be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon. \n\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it’s still dark. \n\n \n\nSend me an answer as soon as possible. \n\nLove, \n\nCyrus \n\nThey looked at one another. \n\n“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Henry Thorn. “It shouldn’t be too diffieult — I think the eloak’s big enough to eover two of us and Nimrod.” \n\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Nimrod — and Malthus. \n\nThere was a hiteh. By the next morning, Rowan’s bitten hand had swollen to twiee its usual size. He didn’t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Patch — would she reeognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no ehoiee. The eut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Nimrod’s fangs were poisonous. \n\nHenry Thorn and Helena mshed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Rowan in a terrible state in bed. \n\n“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that feels like it’s about to fall off. Malthus told Madam Patch he wanted to borrow one of my books so he eould eome and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditeh mateh, that’s why he’s doing this.” \n\nHenry Thorn and Helena tried to ealm Rowan down. \n\n \n\n“It 11 all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Helena, but this didn’t soothe Rowan at all. On the eontrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. \n\n“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voiee. \n\n“Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Cyrus’s letter was in that book Malthus took, he’s going to know we’re getting rid of Nimrod.” \n\nHenry Thorn and Helena didn’t get a ehanee to answer. Madam Patch eame over at that moment and made them leave, saying Rowan needed sleep. \n\n“It’s too late to ehange the plan now,” Henry Thorn told Helena. “We haven’t got time to send Cyrus another owl, and this eould be our only ehanee to get rid of Nimrod. Well have to risk it. And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malthus doesn’t know about that.” \n\nThey found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Harlan Stone, who opened a window to talk to them. \n\n“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Nimrod’s at a trieky stage — nothin’ I ean’t handle.” \n\nWhen they told him about Cyrus’s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been beeause Nimrod had just bitten him on the leg. \n\n“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’ playin’ — he’s only a baby, after all.” \n\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Henry Thorn and Helena walked baek to the eastle feeling Saturday eouldn’t eome quiekly enough. \n\n \n\nThey would have felt sorry for Harlan Stone when the time eame for him to say good-bye to Nimrod if they hadn’t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, eloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Harlan Stone’s hut beeause they’d had to wait for Puck to get out of their way in the entranee hall, where he’d been playing tennis against the wall. \n\nHarlan Stone had Nimrod paeked and ready in a large erate. \n\n“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” said Harlan Stone in a muffled voiee. “An’ I’ve paeked his teddy bear in ease he gets lonely.” \n\nFrom inside the erate eame ripping noises that sounded to Henry Thorn as though the teddy was having his head torn off. \n\n“Bye-bye, Nimrod!” Harlan Stone sobbed, as Henry Thorn and Helena eovered the erate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. “Mamamy will never forget you!” \n\nHow they managed to get the erate baek up to the eastle, they never knew. Midnight tieked nearer as they heaved Nimrod up the marble stairease in the entranee hall and along the dark eorridors. Up another stairease, then another — even one of Henry Thorn’s shorteuts didn’t make the work mueh easier. \n\n“Nearly there!” Henry Thorn panted as they reaehed the eorridor beneath the tallest tower. \n\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the erate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with eaeh other ten feet away. A lamp flared. \n\n \n\nProfessor Hawthorne, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malthus by the ear. \n\n“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you —” \n\n“You don’t understand. Professor. Henry Thorn’s eoming — he’s got a dragon!” \n\n“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell sueh lies! Come on — I shall see Professor Shade about you, Malthus!” \n\nThe steep spiral stairease up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out into the eold night air did they throw off the eloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Helena did a sort of jig. \n\n“Malthus’s got detention! I eould sing!” \n\n“Don’t,” Henry Thorn advised her. \n\nChuekling about Malthus, they waited, Nimrod thrashing about in his erate. About ten minutes later, four broomstieks eame swooping down out of the darkness. \n\nCyrus’s friends were a eheery lot. They showed Henry Thorn and Helena the harness they’d rigged up, so they eould suspend Nimrod between them. They all helped buekle Nimrod safely into it and then Henry Thorn and Helena shook hands with the others and thanked them very mueh. \n\nAt last, Nimrod was going ... going ... gone. \n\n \n\nThey slipped baek down the spiral stairease, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Nimrod was off them. No more dragon — Malthus in detention — what eould spoil their happiness? \n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the eorridor, Finch’s faee loomed suddenly out of the darkness. \n\n“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.” \n\nThey’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower. \n\n \n\n^5 \n\nTHE FORBIDDEN FOREST \n\nThings couldn’t have been worse. \n\nFinch took them down to Professor Hawthorne’s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to eaeh other. Helena was trembling. Exeuses, alibis, and wild eover-up stories ehased eaeh other around Henry Thorn’s brain, eaeh more feeble than the last. He eouldn’t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were eornered. How eould they have been so stupid as to forget the eloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor Hawthorne would aeeept for their being out of bed and ereeping around the sehool in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest Astronomy Tower, whieh was out-of-bounds exeept for elasses. Add Nimrod and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be paeking their bags already. \n\nHad Henry Thorn thought that things eouldn’t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor Hawthorne appeared, she was leading Nathaniel. \n\n \n\n“Henry Thorn!” Nathaniel burst out, the moment he saw the other two. “I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malthus saying he was going to eateh you, he said you had a drag —” \n\nHenry Thorn shook his head violently to shut Nathaniel up, but Professor Hawthorne had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Nimrod as she towered over the three of them. \n\n“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Finch says you were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one o’eloek in the morning. Explain yourselves.” \n\nIt was the first time Helena had ever failed to answer a teaeher’s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. \n\n“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said Professor Hawthorne. “It doesn’t take a genius to work it out. You fed Drake Malthus some eoek-and- bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I’ve already eaught him. I suppose you think it’s funny that Leafbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?” \n\nHenry Thorn eaught Nathaniel’s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn’t true, beeause Nathaniel was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Nathaniel — Henry Thorn knew what it must have eost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them. \n\n“I’m disgusted,” said Professor Hawthorne. “Four students out of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of sueh a thing before! You, Miss Green, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Thorn, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will reeeive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Leafbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk  \n\naround school at night, especially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.” \n\n“Fifty?” Henry Thorn gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d won in the last Quidditeh mateh. \n\n“Fifty points each,” said Professor Hawthorne, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. \n\n“Professor — please —” \n\n“You can’t—” \n\n“Don’t tell me what I ean and ean’t do. Thorn. Now get baek to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.” \n\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last plaee. In one night, they’d ruined any ehanee Gryffindor had had for the House Cup. Henry Thorn felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomaeh. How eould they ever make up for this? \n\nHenry Thorn didn’t sleep all night. He eould hear Nathaniel sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Henry Thorn eouldn’t think of anything to say to eomfort him. He knew Nathaniel, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they’d done? \n\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that reeorded the House points the next day thought there’d been a mistake. How eould they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Henry Thorn, the famous Henry Thorn, their hero of two Quidditeh matehes, had lost them all those points, him and a eouple of other stupid first years. \n\n \n\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the sehool, Henry Thorn was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenelaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, beeause everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Henry Thorn went, people pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their voiees as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, elapped as he walked past them, whistling and eheering, “Thanks Thorn, we owe you one!” \n\nOnly Rowan stood by him. \n\n“They 11 all forget this in a few weeks. Finn and Gale have lost loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like them.” \n\n“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?” said Henry Thorn miserably. \n\n“Well — no,” Rowan admitted. \n\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Henry Thorn swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on. He’d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wildewood and offered to resign from the Quidditeh team. \n\n“Resign?” Wildewood thundered. “What goodll that do? \n\nHow are we going to get any points baek if we ean’t win at Quidditeh?” \n\nBut even Quidditeh had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn’t speak to Henry Thorn during praetiee, and if they had to speak about him, they ealled him “the Seeker.” \n\nHelena and Nathaniel were suffering, too. They didn’t have as bad a time as Henry Thorn, beeause they weren’t as \n\n \n\nwell-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Helena had stopped drawing attention to herself in elass, keeping her head down and working in silenee. \n\nHenry Thorn was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Rowan, and Helena kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in eomplieated potions, learn eharms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magieal diseoveries and goblin rebellions. ... \n\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to start, Henry Thorn’s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t eoneern him was put to an unexpeeted test. Walking baek from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a elassroom up ahead. As he drew eloser, he heard Quibble’s voiee. \n\n“No — no — not again, please —” \n\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. Henry Thorn moved eloser. \n\n“All right — all right —” he heard Quibble sob. \n\nNext seeond, Quibble eame hurrying out of the elassroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to ery. He strode out of sight; Henry Thorn didn’t think Quibble had even notieed him. He waited until Quibble’s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the elassroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Henry Thorn was halfway toward it before he remembered what he’d promised himself about not meddling. \n\nAll the same, he’d have gambled twelve Soreerer’s Stones that Shade had just left the room, and from \n\n \n\nwhat Henry Thorn had just heard, Shade would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quibble seemed to have given in at last. \n\nHenry Thorn went baek to the library, where Helena was testing Rowan on Astronomy. Henry Thorn told them what he’d heard. \n\n“Shade’s done it, then!” said Rowan. “If Quibble’s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Foree spell —” \n\n“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Helena. \n\n“Maybe Shade’s found out how to get past him without asking Harlan Stone,” said Rowan, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. “I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Henry Thorn?” \n\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Rowan’s eyes, but Helena answered before Henry Thorn eould. \n\n“Go to Starling. That’s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.” \n\n“But we’ve got no proof.” said Henry Thorn. “Quibble’s too seared to baek us up. Shade’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor — who do you think theyll believe, him or us? It’s not exaetly a seeret we hate him, Starlingll think we made it up to get him saeked. Finch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s too friendly with Shade, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. Thatll take a lot of explaining.” \n\nHelena looked eonvin",

He took it as his master’s will that Jack should drive him and work him just as he drove and worked his master’s other dogs.\n\nDifferent from the Mackenzie toboggans were the Klondike sleds with runners under them. And different was the method of driving the dogs. There was no fan-formation of the team. The dogs worked in single file, one behind another, hauling on double traces. And here, in the Klondike, the leader was indeed the leader. The wisest as well as strongest dog was the leader, and the team obeyed him and feared him. That Snow Claw should quickly gain this post was inevitable. He could not be satisfied with less, as Jack learned after much inconvenience and trouble. Snow Claw picked out the post for himself, and Jack backed his judgment with strong language after the experiment had been tried. But, though he worked in the sled in the day, Snow Claw did not forego the guarding of his master’s property in the night. Thus he was on duty all the time, ever vigilant and faithful, the most valuable of all the dogs.\n\n“Makin’ free to spit out what’s in me,” Jack said one day, “I beg to state that you was a wise guy all right when you paid the price you did for that dog. You clean swindled Elegance Jones on top of pushin’ his face in with your fist.”\n\nA recrudescence of anger glinted in Brandon Lane’s grey eyes, and he muttered savagely, “The beast!”\n\nIn the late spring a great trouble came to Snow Claw. Without warning, the love-master disappeared. There had been warning, but Snow Claw was unversed in such things and did not understand the packing of a grip. He remembered afterwards that his packing had preceded the master’s disappearance; but at the time he suspected nothing. That night he waited for the master to return. At midnight the chill wind that blew drove him to shelter at the rear of the cabin. There he drowsed, only half asleep, his ears keyed for the first sound of the familiar step. But, at two in the morning, his anxiety drove him out to the cold front stoop, where he crouched, and waited.\n\nBut no master came. In the morning the door opened and Jack stepped outside. Snow Claw gazed at him wistfully. There was no common speech by which he might learn what he wanted to know. The days came and went, but never the master. Snow Claw, who had never known sickness in his life, became sick. He became very sick, so sick that Jack was finally compelled to bring him inside the cabin. Also, in writing to his employer, Jack devoted a postscript to Snow Claw.\n\nBrandon Lane reading the letter down in Circle City, came upon the following:\n\n“That dam wolf won’t work. Won’t eat. Aint got no spunk left. All the dogs is licking him. Wants to know what has become of you, and I don’t know how to tell him. Mebbe he is going to die.”\n\nIt was as Jack had said. Snow Claw had ceased eating, lost heart, and allowed every dog of the team to thrash him. In the cabin he lay on the floor near the stove, without interest in food, in Jack, nor in life. Jack might talk gently to him or swear at him, it was all the same; he never did more than turn his dull eyes upon the man, then drop his head back to its customary position on his fore-paws.\n\nAnd then, one night, Jack, reading to himself with moving lips and mumbled sounds, was startled by a low whine from Snow Claw. He had got upon his feet, his ears cocked towards the door, and he was listening intently. A moment later, Jack heard a footstep. The door opened, and Brandon Lane stepped in. The two men shook hands. Then Lane looked around the room.\n\n“Where’s the wolf?” he asked.\n\nThen he discovered him, standing where he had been lying, near to the stove. He had not rushed forward after the manner of other dogs. He stood, watching and waiting.\n\n“Holy smoke!” Jack exclaimed. “Look at ’m wag his tail!”\n\nBrandon Lane strode half across the room toward him, at the same time calling him. Snow Claw came to him, not with a great bound, yet quickly. He was awakened from self-consciousness, but as he drew near, his eyes took on a strange expression. Something, an incommunicable vastness of feeling, rose up into his eyes as a light and shone forth.\n\n“He never looked at me that way all the time you was gone!” Jack commented.\n\nBrandon Lane did not hear. He was squatting down on his heels, face to face with Snow Claw and petting him—rubbing at the roots of the ears, making long caressing strokes down the neck to the shoulders, tapping the spine gently with the balls of his fingers. And Snow Claw was growling responsively, the crooning note of the growl more pronounced than ever.\n\nBut that was not all. What of his joy, the great love in him, ever surging and struggling to express itself, succeeded in finding a new mode of expression. He suddenly thrust his head forward and nudged his way in between the master’s arm and body. And here, confined, hidden from view all except his ears, no longer growling, he continued to nudge and snuggle.\n\nThe two men looked at each other. Lane’s eyes were shining.\n\n“Gosh!” said Jack in an awe-stricken voice.\n\nA moment later, when he had recovered himself, he said, “I always insisted that wolf was a dog. Look at ’m!”\n\nWith the return of the love-master, Snow Claw’s recovery was rapid. Two nights and a day he spent in the cabin. Then he sallied forth. The sled-dogs had forgotten his prowess. They remembered only the latest, which was his weakness and sickness. At the sight of him as he came out of the cabin, they sprang upon him.\n\n“Talk about your rough-houses,” Jack murmured gleefully, standing in the doorway and looking on.\n\n“Give ’m hell, you wolf! Give ’m hell!—an’ then some!”\n\nSnow Claw did not need the encouragement. The return of the love-master was enough. Life was flowing through him again, splendid and indomitable. He fought from sheer joy, finding in it an expression of much that he felt and that otherwise was without speech. There could be but one ending. The team dispersed in ignominious defeat, and it was not until after dark that the dogs came sneaking back, one by one, by meekness and humility signifying their fealty to Snow Claw.\n\nHaving learned to snuggle, Snow Claw was guilty of it often. It was the final word. He could not go beyond it. The one thing of which he had always been particularly jealous was his head. He had always disliked to have it touched. It was the Wild in him, the fear of hurt and of the trap, that had given rise to the panicky impulses to avoid contacts. It was the mandate of his instinct that that head must be free. And now, with the love-master, his snuggling was the deliberate act of putting himself into a position of hopeless helplessness. It was an expression of perfect confidence, of absolute self-surrender, as though he said: “I put myself into thy hands. Work thou thy will with me.”\n\nOne night, not long after the return, Lane and Jack sat at a game of cribbage preliminary to going to bed. “Fifteen-two, fifteen-four an’ a pair makes six,” Mat was pegging up, when there was an outcry and sound of snarling without. They looked at each other as they started to rise to their feet.\n\n“The wolf’s nailed somebody,” Jack said.\n\nA wild scream of fear and anguish hastened them.\n\n“Bring a light!” Lane shouted, as he sprang outside.\n\nJack followed with the lamp, and by its light they saw a man lying on his back in the snow. His arms were folded, one above the other, across his face and throat. Thus he was trying to shield himself from Snow Claw’s teeth. And there was need for it. Snow Claw was in a rage, wickedly making his attack on the most vulnerable spot. From shoulder to wrist of the crossed arms, the coat-sleeve, blue flannel shirt and undershirt were ripped in rags, while the arms themselves were terribly slashed and streaming blood.\n\nAll this the two men saw in the first instant. The next instant Brandon Lane had Snow Claw by the throat and was dragging him clear. Snow Claw struggled and snarled, but made no attempt to bite, while he quickly quieted down at a sharp word from the master.\n\nJack helped the man to his feet. As he arose he lowered his crossed arms, exposing the bestial face of Elegance Jones. The dog-musher let go of him precipitately, with action similar to that of a man who has picked up live fire. Elegance Jones blinked in the lamplight and looked about him. He caught sight of Snow Claw and terror rushed into his face.\n\nAt the same moment Jack noticed two objects lying in the snow. He held the lamp close to them, indicating them with his toe for his employer’s benefit—a steel dog-chain and a stout club.\n\nBrandon Lane saw and nodded. Not a word was spoken. The dog-musher laid his hand on Elegance Jones’s shoulder and faced him to the right about. No word needed to be spoken. Elegance Jones started.\n\nIn the meantime the love-master was patting Snow Claw and talking to him.\n\n“Tried to steal you, eh? And you wouldn’t have it! Well, well, he made a mistake, didn’t he?”\n\n“Must ‘a’ thought he had hold of seventeen devils,” the dog-musher sniggered.\n\nSnow Claw, still wrought up and bristling, growled and growled, the hair slowly lying down, the crooning note remote and dim, but growing in his throat.\n\nPART V\nCHAPTER I\nTHE LONG TRAIL\nIt was in the air. Snow Claw sensed the coming calamity, even before there was tangible evidence of it. In vague ways it was borne in upon him that a change was impending. He knew not how nor why, yet he got his feel of the oncoming event from the gods themselves. In ways subtler than they knew, they betrayed their intentions to the wolf-dog that haunted the cabin-stoop, and that, though he never came inside the cabin, knew what went on inside their brains.\n\n“Listen to that, will you!” the dog-musher exclaimed at supper one night.\n\nBrandon Lane listened. Through the door came a low, anxious whine, like a sobbing under the breath that had just grown audible. Then came the long sniff, as Snow Claw reassured himself that his god was still inside and had not yet taken himself off in mysterious and solitary flight.\n\n“I do believe that wolf’s on to you,” the dog-musher said.\n\nBrandon Lane looked across at his companion with eyes that almost pleaded, though this was given the lie by his words.\n\n“What the devil can I do with a wolf in California?” he demanded.\n\n“That’s what I say,” Jack answered. “What the devil can you do with a wolf in California?”\n\nBut this did not satisfy Brandon Lane. The other seemed to be judging him in a non-committal sort of way.\n\n“White man’s dogs would have no show against him,” Lane went on. “He’d kill them on sight. If he didn’t bankrupt me with damaged suits, the authorities would take him away from me and electrocute him.”\n\n“He’s a downright murderer, I know,” was the dog-musher’s comment.\n\nBrandon Lane looked at him suspiciously.\n\n“It would never do,” he said decisively.\n\n“It would never do!” Jack concurred. “Why you’d have to hire a man ’specially to take care of ’m.”\n\nThe other’s suspicion was allayed. He nodded cheerfully. In the silence that followed, the low, half-sobbing whine was heard at the door and then the long, questing sniff.\n\n“There’s no denyin’ he thinks a hell of a lot of you,” Jack said.\n\nThe other glared at him in sudden wrath. “Damn it all, man! I know my own mind and what’s best!”\n\n“I’m agreein’ with you, only . . . ”\n\n“Only what?” Lane snapped out.\n\n“Only . . . ” the dog-musher began softly, then changed his mind and betrayed a rising anger of his own. “Well, you needn’t get so all-fired het up about it. Judgin’ by your actions one’d think you didn’t know your own mind.”\n\nBrandon Lane debated with himself for a while, and then said more gently: “You are right, Jack. I don’t know my own mind, and that’s what’s the trouble.”\n\n“Why, it would be rank ridiculousness for me to take that dog along,” he broke out after another pause.\n\n“I’m agreein’ with you,” was Jack’s answer, and again his employer was not quite satisfied with him.\n\n“But how in the name of the great Sardanapolis he knows you’re goin’ is what gets me,” the dog-musher continued innocently.\n\n“It’s beyond me, Jack,” Lane answered, with a mournful shake of the head.\n\nThen came the day when, through the open cabin door, Snow Claw saw the fatal grip on the floor and the love-master packing things into it. Also, there were comings and goings, and the erstwhile placid atmosphere of the cabin was vexed with strange perturbations and unrest. Here was indubitable evidence. Snow Claw had already scented it. He now reasoned it. His god was preparing for another flight. And since he had not taken him with him before, so, now, he could look to be left behind.\n\nThat night he lifted the long wolf-howl. As he had howled, in his puppy days, when he fled back from the Wild to the village to find it vanished and naught but a rubbish-heap to mark the site of Stone Coyote’s tepee, so now he pointed his muzzle to the cold stars and told to them his woe.\n\nInside the cabin the two men had just gone to bed.\n\n“He’s gone off his food again,” Jack remarked from his bunk.\n\nThere was a grunt from Brandon Lane’s bunk, and a stir of blankets.\n\n“From the way he cut up the other time you went away, I wouldn’t wonder this time but what he died.”\n\nThe blankets in the other bunk stirred irritably.\n\n“Oh, shut up!” Lane cried out through the darkness. “You nag worse than a woman.”\n\n“I’m agreein’ with you,” the dog-musher answered, and Brandon Lane was not quite sure whether or not the other had snickered.\n\nThe next day Snow Claw’s anxiety and restlessness were even more pronounced. He dogged his master’s heels whenever he left the cabin, and haunted the front stoop when he remained inside. Through the open door he could catch glimpses of the luggage on the floor. The grip had been joined by two large canvas bags and a box. Jack was rolling the master’s blankets and fur robe inside a small tarpaulin. Snow Claw whined as he watched the operation.\n\nLater on two Indians arrived. He watched them closely as they shouldered the luggage and were led off down the hill by Jack, who carried the bedding and the grip. But Snow Claw did not follow them. The master was still in the cabin. After a time, Jack returned. The master came to the door and called Snow Claw inside.\n\n“You poor devil,” he said gently, rubbing Snow Claw’s ears and tapping his spine. “I’m hitting the long trail, old man, where you cannot follow. Now give me a growl—the last, good, good-bye growl.”\n\nBut Snow Claw refused to growl. Instead, and after a wistful, searching look, he snuggled in, burrowing his head out of sight between the master’s arm and body.\n\n“There she blows!” Jack cried. From the Yukon arose the hoarse bellowing of a river steamboat. “You’ve got to cut it short. Be sure and lock the front door. I’ll go out the back. Get a move on!”\n\nThe two doors slammed at the same moment, and Brandon Lane waited for Jack to come around to the front. From inside the door came a low whining and sobbing. Then there were long, deep-drawn sniffs.\n\n“You must take good care of him, Jack,” Lane said, as they started down the hill. “Write and let me know how he gets along.”\n\n“Sure,” the dog-musher answered. “But listen to that, will you!”\n\nBoth men stopped. Snow Claw was howling as dogs howl when their masters lie dead. He was voicing an utter woe, his cry bursting upward in great heart-breaking rushes, dying down into quavering misery, and bursting upward again with a rush upon rush of grief.\n\nThe Aurora was the first steamboat of the year for the Outside, and her decks were jammed with prosperous adventurers and broken gold seekers, all equally as mad to get to the Outside as they had been originally to get to the Inside. Near the gang-plank, Lane was shaking hands with Jack, who was preparing to go ashore. But Jack’s hand went limp in the other’s grasp as his gaze shot past and remained fixed on something behind him. Lane turned to see. Sitting on the deck several feet away and watching wistfully was Snow Claw.\n\nThe dog-musher swore softly, in awe-stricken accents. Lane could only look in wonder.\n\n“Did you lock the front door?” Jack demanded. The other nodded, and asked, “How about the back?”\n\n“You just bet I did,” was the fervent reply.\n\nSnow Claw flattened his ears ingratiatingly, but remained where he was, making no attempt to approach.\n\n“I’ll have to take ’m ashore with me.”\n\nJack made a couple of steps toward Snow Claw, but the latter slid away from him. The dog-musher made a rush of it, and Snow Claw dodged between the legs of a group of men. Ducking, turning, doubling, he slid about the deck, eluding the other’s efforts to capture him.\n\nBut when the love-master spoke, Snow Claw came to him with prompt obedience.\n\n“Won’t come to the hand that’s fed ’m all these months,” the dog-musher muttered resentfully. “And you—you ain’t never fed ’m after them first days of gettin’ acquainted. I’m blamed if I can see how he works it out that you’re the boss.”\n\nLane, who had been patting Snow Claw, suddenly bent closer and pointed out fresh-made cuts on his muzzle, and a gash between the eyes.\n\nJack bent over and passed his hand along Snow Claw’s belly.\n\n“We plump forgot the window. He’s all cut an’ gouged underneath. Must ‘a’ butted clean through it, b’gosh!”\n\nBut Brandon Lane was not listening. He was thinking rapidly. The Aurora’s whistle hooted a final announcement of departure. Men were scurrying down the gang-plank to the shore. Jack loosened the bandana from his own neck and started to put it around Snow Claw’s. Lane grasped the dog-musher’s hand.\n\n“Good-bye, Jack, old man. About the wolf—you needn’t write. You see, I’ve . . . !”\n\n“What!” the dog-musher exploded. “You don’t mean to say . . .?”\n\n“The very thing I mean. Here’s your bandana. I’ll write to you about him.”\n\nJack paused halfway down the gang-plank.\n\n“He’ll never stand the climate!” he shouted back. “Unless you clip ’m in warm weather!”\n\nThe gang-plank was hauled in, and the Aurora swung out from the bank. Brandon Lane waved a last good-bye. Then he turned and bent over Snow Claw, standing by his side.\n\n“Now growl, damn you, growl,” he said, as he patted the responsive head and rubbed the flattening ears.\n\nCHAPTER II\nTHE SOUTHLAND\nSnow Claw landed from the steamer in San Francisco. He was appalled. Deep in him, below any reasoning process or act of consciousness, he had associated power with godhead. And never had the white men seemed such marvellous gods as now, when he trod the slimy pavement of San Francisco. The log cabins he had known were replaced by towering buildings. The streets were crowded with perils—waggons, carts, automobiles; great, straining horses pulling huge trucks; and monstrous cable and electric cars hooting and clanging through the midst, screeching their insistent menace after the manner of the lynxes he had known in the northern woods.\n\nAll this was the manifestation of power. Through it all, behind it all, was man, governing and controlling, expressing himself, as of old, by his mastery over matter. It was colossal, stunning. Snow Claw was awed. Fear sat upon him. As in his cubhood he had been made to feel his smallness and puniness on the day he first came in from the Wild to the village of Stone Coyote, so now, in his full-grown stature and pride of strength, he was made to feel small and puny. And there were so many gods! He was made dizzy by the swarming of them. The thunder of the streets smote upon his ears. He was bewildered by the tremendous and endless rush and movement of things. As never before, he felt his dependence on the love-master, close at whose heels he followed, no matter what happened never losing sight of him.\n\nBut Snow Claw was to have no more than a nightmare vision of the city—an experience that was like a bad dream, unreal and terrible, that haunted him for long after in his dreams. He was put into a baggage-car by the master, chained in a corner in the midst of heaped trunks and valises. Here a squat and brawny god held sway, with much noise, hurling trunks and boxes about, dragging them in through the door and tossing them into the piles, or flinging them out of the door, smashing and crashing, to other gods who awaited them.\n\nAnd here, in this inferno of luggage, was Snow Claw deserted by the master. Or at least Snow Claw thought he was deserted, until he smelled out the master’s canvas clothes-bags alongside of him, and proceeded to mount guard over them.\n\n“’Bout time you come,” growled the god of the car, an hour later, when Brandon Lane appeared at the door. “That dog of yourn won’t let me lay a finger on your stuff.”\n\nSnow Claw emerged from the car. He was astonished. The nightmare city was gone. The car had been to him no more than a room in a house, and when he had entered it the city had been all around him. In the interval the city had disappeared. The roar of it no longer dinned upon his ears. Before him was smiling country, streaming with sunshine, lazy with quietude. But he had little time to marvel at the transformation. He accepted it as he accepted all the unaccountable doings and manifestations of the gods. It was their way.\n\nThere was a carriage waiting. A man and a woman approached the master. The woman’s arms went out and clutched the master around the neck—a hostile act! The next moment Brandon Lane had torn loose from the embrace and closed with Snow Claw, who had become a snarling, raging demon.\n\n“It’s all right, mother,” Lane was saying as he kept tight hold of Snow Claw and placated him. “He thought you were going to injure me, and he wouldn’t stand for it. It’s all right. It’s all right. He’ll learn soon enough.”\n\n“And in the meantime I may be permitted to love my son when his dog is not around,” she laughed, though she was pale and weak from the fright.\n\nShe looked at Snow Claw, who snarled and bristled and glared malevolently.\n\n“He’ll have to learn, and he shall, without postponement,” Lane said.\n\nHe spoke softly to Snow Claw until he had quieted him, then his voice became firm.\n\n“Down, sir! Down with you!”\n\nThis had been one of the things taught him by the master, and Snow Claw obeyed, though he lay down reluctantly and sullenly.\n\n“Now, mother.”\n\nLane opened his arms to her, but kept his eyes on Snow Claw.\n\n“Down!” he warned. “Down!”\n\nSnow Claw, bristling silently, half-crouching as he rose, sank back and watched the hostile act repeated. But no harm came of it, nor of the embrace from the strange man-god that followed. Then the clothes-bags were taken into the carriage, the strange gods and the love-master followed, and Snow Claw pursued, now running vigilantly behind, now bristling up to the running horses and warning them that he was there to see that no harm befell the god they dragged so swiftly across the earth.\n\nAt the end of fifteen minutes, the carriage swung in through a stone gateway and on between a double row of arched and interlacing walnut trees. On either side stretched lawns, their broad sweep broken here and there by great sturdy-limbed oaks. In the near distance, in contrast with the young-green of the tended grass, sunburnt hay-fields showed tan and gold; while beyond were the tawny hills and upland pastures. From the head of the lawn, on the first soft swell from the valley-level, looked down the deep-porched, many-windowed house.\n\nLittle opportunity was given Snow Claw to see all this. Hardly had the carriage entered the grounds, when he was set upon by a sheep-dog, bright-eyed, sharp-muzzled, righteously indignant and angry. It was between him and the master, cutting him off. Snow Claw snarled no warning, but his hair bristled as he made his silent and deadly rush. This rush was never completed. He halted with awkward abruptness, with stiff fore-legs bracing himself against his momentum, almost sitting down on his haunches, so desirous was he of avoiding contact with the dog he was in the act of attacking. It was a female, and the law of his kind thrust a barrier between. For him to attack her would require nothing less than a violation of his instinct.\n\nBut with the sheep-dog it was otherwise. Being a female, she possessed no such instinct. On the other hand, being a sheep-dog, her instinctive fear of the Wild, and especially of the wolf, was unusually keen. Snow Claw was to her a wolf, the hereditary marauder who had preyed upon her flocks from the time sheep were first herded and guarded by some dim ancestor of hers. And so, as he abandoned his rush at her and braced himself to avoid the contact, she sprang upon him. He snarled involuntarily as he felt her teeth in his shoulder, but beyond this made no offer to hurt her. He backed away, stiff-legged with self-consciousness, and tried to go around her. He dodged this way and that, and curved and turned, but to no purpose. She remained always between him and the way he wanted to go.\n\n“Here, Collie!” called the strange man in the carriage.\n\nBrandon Lane laughed.\n\n“Never mind, father. It is good discipline. Snow Claw will have to learn many things, and it’s just as well that he begins now. He’ll adjust himself all right.”\n\nThe carriage drove on, and still Collie blocked Snow Claw’s way. He tried to outrun her by leaving the drive and circling across the lawn but she ran on the inner and smaller circle, and was always there, facing him with her two rows of gleaming teeth. Back he circled, across the drive to the other lawn, and again she headed him off.\n\nThe carriage was bearing the master away. Snow Claw caught glimpses of it disappearing amongst the trees. The situation was desperate. He essayed another circle. She followed, running swiftly. And then, suddenly, he turned upon her. It was his old fighting trick. Shoulder to shoulder, he struck her squarely. Not only was she overthrown. So fast had she been running that she rolled along, now on her back, now on her side, as she struggled to stop, clawing gravel with her feet and crying shrilly her hurt pride and indignation.\n\nSnow Claw did not wait. The way was clear, and that was all he had wanted. She took after him, never ceasing her outcry. It was the straightaway now, and when it came to real running, Snow Claw could teach her things. She ran frantically, hysterically, straining to the utmost, advertising the effort she was making with every leap: and all the time Snow Claw slid smoothly away from her silently, without effort, gliding like a ghost over the ground.\n\nAs he rounded the house to the porte-cochère, he came upon the carriage. It had stopped, and the master was alighting. At this moment, still running at top speed, Snow Claw became suddenly aware of an attack from the side. It was a deer-hound rushing upon him. Snow Claw tried to face it. But he was going too fast, and the hound was too close. It struck him on the side; and such was his forward momentum and the unexpectedness of it, Snow Claw was hurled to the ground and rolled clear over. He came out of the tangle a spectacle of malignancy, ears flattened back, lips writhing, nose wrinkling, his teeth clipping together as the fangs barely missed the hound’s soft throat.\n\nThe master was running up, but was too far away; and it was Collie that saved the hound’s life. Before Snow Claw could spring in and deliver the fatal stroke, and just as he was in the act of springing in, Collie arrived. She had been out-manoeuvred and out-run, to say nothing of her having been unceremoniously tumbled in the gravel, and her arrival was like that of a tornado—made up of offended dignity, justifiable wrath, and instinctive hatred for this marauder from the Wild. She struck Snow Claw at right angles in the midst of his spring, and again he was knocked off his feet and rolled over.\n\nThe next moment the master arrived, and with one hand held Snow Claw, while the father called off the dogs.\n\n“I say, this is a pretty warm reception for a poor lone wolf from the Arctic,” the master said, while Snow Claw calmed down under his caressing hand. “In all his life he’s only been known once to go off his feet, and here he’s been rolled twice in thirty seconds.”\n\nThe carriage had driven away, and other strange gods had appeared from out the house. Some of these stood respectfully at a distance; but two of them, women, perpetrated the hostile act of clutching the master around the neck. Snow Claw, however, was beginning to tolerate this act. No harm seemed to come of it, while the noises the gods made were certainly not threatening. These gods also made overtures to Snow Claw, but he warned them off with a snarl, and the master did likewise with word of mouth. At such times Snow Claw leaned in close against the master’s legs and received reassuring pats on the head.\n\nThe hound, under the command, “Dick! Lie down, sir!” had gone up the steps and lain down to one side of the porch, still growling and keeping a sullen watch on the intruder. Collie had been taken in charge by one of the woman-gods, who held arms around her neck and petted and caressed her; but Collie was very much perplexed and worried, whining and restless, outraged by the permitted presence of this wolf and confident that the gods were making a mistake.\n\nAll the gods started up the steps to enter the house. Snow Claw followed closely at the master’s heels. Dick, on the porch, growled, and Snow Claw, on the steps, bristled and growled back.\n\n“Take Collie inside and leave the two of them to fight it out,” suggested Lane’s father. “After that they’ll be friends.”\n\n“Then Snow Claw, to show his friendship, will have to be chief mourner at the funeral,” laughed the master.\n\nThe elder Lane looked incredulously, first at Snow Claw, then at Dick, and finally at his son.\n\n“You mean . . .?”\n\nBrandon nodded his head. “I mean just that. You’d have a dead Dick inside one minute—two minutes at the farthest.”\n\nHe turned to Snow Claw. “Come on, you wolf. It’s you that’ll have to come inside.”\n\nSnow Claw walked stiff-legged up the steps and across the porch, with tail rigidly erect, keeping his eyes on Dick to guard against a flank attack, and at the same time prepared for whatever fierce manifestation of the unknown that might pounce out upon him from the interior of the house. But no thing of fear pounced out, and when he had gained the inside he scouted carefully around, looking at it and finding it not. Then he lay down with a contented grunt at the master’s feet, observing all that went on, ever ready to spring to his feet and fight for life with the terrors he felt must lurk under the trap-roof of the dwelling.\n\nCHAPTER III\nTHE GOD’S DOMAIN\nNot only was Snow Claw adaptable by nature, but he had travelled much, and knew the meaning and necessity of adjustment. Here, in Sierra Vista, which was the name of Judge Lane’s place, Snow Claw quickly began to make himself at home. He had no further serious trouble with the dogs. They knew more about the ways of the Southland gods than did he, and in their eyes he had qualified when he accompanied the gods inside the house. Wolf that he was, and unprecedented as it was, the gods had sanctioned his presence, and they, the dogs of the gods, could only recognise this sanction.\n\nDick, perforce, had to go through a few stiff formalities at first, after which he calmly accepted Snow Claw as an addition to the premises. Had Dick had his way, they would have been good friends; but Snow Claw was averse to friendship. All he asked of other dogs was to be let alone. His whole life he had kept aloof from his kind, and he still desired to keep aloof. Dick’s overtures bothered him, so he snarled Dick away. In the north he had learned the lesson that he must let the master’s dogs alone, and he did not forget that lesson now. But he insisted on his own privacy and self-seclusion, and so thoroughly ignored Dick that that good-natured creature finally gave him up and scarcely took as much interest in him as in the hitching-post near the stable.\n\nNot so with Collie. While she accepted him because it was the mandate of the gods, that was no reason that she should leave him in peace. Woven into her being was the memory of countless crimes he and his had perpetrated against her ancestry. Not in a day nor a generation were the ravaged sheepfolds to be forgotten. All this was a spur to her, pricking her to retaliation. She could not fly in the face of the gods who permitted him, but that did not prevent her from making life miserable for him in petty ways. A feud, ages old, was between them, and she, for one, would see to it that he was reminded.\n\nSo Collie took advantage of her sex to pick upon Snow Claw and maltreat him. His instinct would not permit him to attack her, while her persistence would not permit him to ignore her. When she rushed at him he turned his fur-protected shoulder to her sharp teeth and walked away stiff-legged and stately. When she forced him too hard, he was compelled to go about in a circle, his shoulder presented to her, his head turned from her, and on his face and in his eyes a patient and bored expression. Sometimes, however, a nip on his hind-quarters hastened his retreat and made it anything but stately. But as a rule he managed to maintain a dignity that was almost solemnity. He ignored her existence whenever it was possible, and made it a point to keep out of her way. When he saw or heard her coming, he got up and walked off.\n\nThere was much in other matters for Snow Claw to learn. Life in the Northland was simplicity itself when compared with the complicated affairs of Sierra Vista. First of all, he had to learn the family of the master. In a way he was prepared to do this. As Swift River and Moon Blossom had belonged to Stone Coyote, sharing his food, his fire, and his blankets, so now, at Sierra Vista, belonged to the love-master all the denizens of the house.\n\nBut in this matter there was a difference, and many differences. Sierra Vista was a far vaster affair than the tepee of Stone Coyote. There were many persons to be considered. There was Judge Lane, and there was his wife. There were the master’s two sisters, Clara and Anna. There was his wife, Fiona, and then there were his children, Brandon and Lila, toddlers of four and six. There was no way for anybody to tell him about all these people, and of blood-ties and relationship he knew nothing whatever and never would be capable of knowing. Yet he quickly worked it out that all of them belonged to the master. Then, by observation, whenever opportunity offered, by study of action, speech, and the very intonations of the voice, he slowly learned the intimacy and the degree of favour they enjoyed with the master. And by this ascertained standard, Snow Claw treated them accordingly. What was of value to the master he valued; what was dear to the master was to be cherished by Snow Claw and guarded carefully.\n\nThus it was with the two children. All his life he had disliked children. He hated and feared their hands. The lessons were not tender that he had learned of their tyranny and cruelty in the days of the Indian villages. When Brandon and Lila had first approached him, he growled warningly and looked malignant. A cuff from the master and a sharp word had then compelled him to permit their caresses, though he growled and growled under their tiny hands, and in the growl there was no crooning note. Later, he observed that the boy and girl were of great value in the master’s eyes. Then it was that no cuff nor sharp word was necessary before they could pat him.\n\nYet Snow Claw was never effusively affectionate. He yielded to the master’s children with an ill but honest grace, and endured their fooling as one would endure a painful operation. When he could no longer endure, he would get up and stalk determinedly away from them. But after a time, he grew even to like the children. Still he was not demonstrative. He would not go up to them. On the other hand, instead of walking away at sight of them, he waited for them to come to him. And still later, it was noticed that a pleased light came into his eyes when he saw them approaching, and that he looked after them with an appearance of curious regret when they left him for other amusements.\n\nAll this was a matter of development, and took time. Next in his regard, after the children, was Judge Lane. There were two reasons, possibly, for this. First, he was evidently a valuable possession of the master’s, and next, he was undemonstrative. Snow Claw liked to lie at his feet on the wide porch when he read the newspaper, from time to time favouring Snow Claw with a look or a word—untroublesome tokens that he recognised Snow Claw’s presence and existence. But this was only when the master was not around. When the master appeared, all other beings ceased to exist so far as Snow Claw was concerned.\n\nSnow Claw allowed all the members of the family to pet him and make much of him; but he never gave to them what he gave to the master. No caress of theirs could put the love-croon into his throat, and, try as they would, they could never persuade him into snuggling against them. This expression of abandon and surrender, of absolute trust, he reserved for the master alone. In fact, he never regarded the members of the family in any other light than possessions of the love-master.\n\nAlso Snow Claw had early come to differentiate between the family and the servants of the household. The latter were afraid of him, while he merely refrained from attacking them. This because he considered that they were likewise possessions of the master. Between Snow Claw and them existed a neutrality and no more. They cooked for the master and washed the dishes and did other things just as Jack had done up in the Klondike. They were, in short, appurtenances of the household.\n\nOutside the household there was even more for Snow Claw to learn. The master’s domain was wide and complex, yet it had its metes and bounds. The land itself ceased at the county road. Outside was the common domain of all gods—the roads and streets. Then inside other fences were the particular domains of other gods. A myriad laws governed all these things and determined conduct; yet he did not know the speech of the gods, nor was there any way for him to learn save by experience. He obeyed his natural impulses until they ran him counter to some law. When this had been done a few times, he learned the law and after that observed it.\n\nBut most potent in his education was the cuff of the master’s hand, the censure of the master’s voice. Because of Snow Claw’s very great love, a cuff from the master hurt him far more than any beating Stone Coyote or Elegance Jones had ever given him. They had hurt only the flesh of him; beneath the flesh the spirit had still raged, splendid and invincible. But with the master the cuff was always too light to hurt the flesh. Yet it went deeper. It was an expression of the master’s disapproval, and Snow Claw’s spirit wilted under it.\n\nIn point of fact, the cuff was rarely administered. The master’s voice was sufficient. By it Snow Claw knew whether he did right or not. By it he trimmed his conduct and adjusted his actions. It was the compass by which he steered and learned to chart the manners of a new land and life.\n\nIn the Northland, the only domesticated animal was the dog. All other animals lived in the Wild, and were, when not too formidable, lawful spoil for any dog. All his days Snow Claw had foraged among the live things for food. It did not enter his head that in the Southland it was otherwise. But this he was to learn early in his residence in Santa Clara Valley. Sauntering around the corner of the house ",

    "context": "They have treated me shamefully—shamefully. When the facts come out in Hawthorne v. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will run through the country. Nothing would induce me to help the police in any way. For all they cared it might have been me, instead of my effigy, which these rascals burned at the stake. Surely you are not going! You will help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion!”\n\nBut I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him from his announced intention of walking home with me. I kept the road as long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off across the moor and made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared. Everything was working in my favour, and I swore that it should not be through lack of energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune had thrown in my way.\n\nThe sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the hill, and the long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one side and grey shadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out of which jutted the fantastic shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the wide expanse there was no sound and no movement. One great grey bird, a gull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be the only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert beneath it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy was nowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle of them there was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the weather. My heart leaped within me as I saw it. This must be the burrow where the stranger lurked. At last my foot was on the threshold of his hiding place—his secret was within my grasp.\n\nAs I approached the hut, walking as warily as Kensington would do when with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself that the place had indeed been used as a habitation. A vague pathway among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a door. All was silent within. The unknown might be lurking there, or he might be prowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of adventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked in. The place was empty.\n\nBut there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. This was certainly where the man lived. Some blankets rolled in a waterproof lay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic man had once slumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate. Beside it lay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A litter of empty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I saw, as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and a half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of the hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood a small cloth bundle—the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the telescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained a loaf of bread, a tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I set it down again, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this was what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil: “Dr. Hawkins has gone to Coombe Tracey.”\n\nFor a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the meaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was being dogged by this secret man. He had not followed me himself, but he had set an agent—the boy, perhaps—upon my track, and this was his report. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor which had not been observed and reported. Always there was this feeling of an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and delicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment that one realised that one was indeed entangled in its meshes.\n\nIf there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut in search of them. There was no trace, however, of anything of the kind, nor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or intentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he must be of Spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life. When I thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I understood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept him in that inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by chance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut until I knew.\n\nOutside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet and gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant pools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There were the two towers of Winthrop Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the village of Grimpen. Between the two, behind the hill, was the house of the Kensingtons. All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden evening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the peace of Nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that interview which every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves but a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.\n\nAnd then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a boot striking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming nearer and nearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in my pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity of seeing something of the stranger. There was a long pause which showed that he had stopped. Then once more the footsteps approached and a shadow fell across the opening of the hut.\n\n“It is a lovely evening, my dear Turner Hawkins,” said a well-known voice. “I really think that you will be more comfortable outside than in.”\n\nChapter 12.\nDeath on the Moor\nFor a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears. Then my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight of responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul. That cold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the world.\n\n“Crawford!” I cried—“Crawford!”\n\n“Come out,” said he, “and please be careful with the revolver.”\n\nI stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone outside, his grey eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished features. He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face bronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind. In his tweed suit and cloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had contrived, with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one of his characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen as perfect as if he were in Baker Street.\n\n“I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,” said I as I wrung him by the hand.\n\n“Or more astonished, eh?”\n\n“Well, I must confess to it.”\n\n“The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no idea that you had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it, until I was within twenty paces of the door.”\n\n“My footprint, I presume?”\n\n“No, Turner Hawkins, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your footprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously desire to deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know that my friend Turner Hawkins is in the neighbourhood. You will see it there beside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment when you charged into the empty hut.”\n\n“Exactly.”\n\n“I thought as much—and knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that I was the criminal?”\n\n“I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.”\n\n“Excellent, Turner Hawkins! And how did you localise me? You saw me, perhaps, on the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the moon to rise behind me?”\n\n“Yes, I saw you then.”\n\n“And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?”\n\n“No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to look.”\n\n“The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make it out when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.” He rose and peeped into the hut. “Ha, I see that Underwood has brought up some supplies. What’s this paper? So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have you?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“To see Mrs. Natalie Gates?”\n\n“Exactly.”\n\n“Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on parallel lines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly full knowledge of the case.”\n\n“Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the responsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my nerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have you been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that case of blackmailing.”\n\n“That was what I wished you to think.”\n\n“Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!” I cried with some bitterness. “I think that I have deserved better at your hands, Crawford.”\n\n“My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it, and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to come down and examine the matter for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the same as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable opponents to be on their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about as I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my weight at a critical moment.”\n\n“But why keep me in the dark?”\n\n“For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led to my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something, or in your kindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an unnecessary risk would be run. I brought Underwood down with me—you remember the little chap at the express office—and he has seen after my simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man want more? He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of feet, and both have been invaluable.”\n\n“Then my reports have all been wasted!”—My voice trembled as I recalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.\n\nCrawford took a bundle of papers from his pocket.\n\n“Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure you. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day upon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult case.”\n\nI was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me, but the warmth of Crawford’s praise drove my anger from my mind. I felt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was really best for our purpose that I should not have known that he was upon the moor.\n\n“That’s better,” said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face. “And now tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Natalie Gates—it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, for I am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might be of service to us in the matter. In fact, if you had not gone today it is exceedingly probable that I should have gone tomorrow.”\n\nThe sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had turned chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There, sitting together in the twilight, I told Crawford of my conversation with the lady. So interested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was satisfied.\n\n“This is most important,” said he when I had concluded. “It fills up a gap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair. You are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and the man Kensington?”\n\n“I did not know of a close intimacy.”\n\n“There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write, there is a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a very powerful weapon into our hands. If I could only use it to detach his wife—”\n\n“His wife?”\n\n“I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you have given me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Kensington is in reality his wife.”\n\n“Good heavens, Crawford! Are you sure of what you say? How could he have permitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?”\n\n“Sir Henry’s falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir Henry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her, as you have yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his wife and not his sister.”\n\n“But why this elaborate deception?”\n\n“Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in the character of a free woman.”\n\nAll my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and centred upon the naturalist. In that impassive colourless man, with his straw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed to see something terrible—a creature of infinite patience and craft, with a smiling face and a murderous heart.\n\n“It is he, then, who is our enemy—it is he who dogged us in London?”\n\n“So I read the riddle.”\n\n“And the warning—it must have come from her!”\n\n“Exactly.”\n\nThe shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed through the darkness which had girt me so long.\n\n“But are you sure of this, Crawford? How do you know that the woman is his wife?”\n\n“Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of autobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say he has many a time regretted it since. He was once a schoolmaster in the north of England. Now, there is no one more easy to trace than a schoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies by which one may identify any man who has been in the profession. A little investigation showed me that a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that the man who had owned it—the name was different—had disappeared with his wife. The descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man was devoted to entomology the identification was complete.”\n\nThe darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.\n\n“If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Natalie Gates come in?” I asked.\n\n“That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a light. Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very much. I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband. In that case, regarding Kensington as an unmarried man, she counted no doubt upon becoming his wife.”\n\n“And when she is undeceived?”\n\n“Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first duty to see her—both of us—tomorrow. Don’t you think, Turner Hawkins, that you are away from your charge rather long? Your place should be at Winthrop Hall.”\n\nThe last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled upon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.\n\n“One last question, Crawford,” I said as I rose. “Surely there is no need of secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all? What is he after?”\n\nCrawford’s voice sank as he answered:\n\n“It is murder, Turner Hawkins—refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. Do not ask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even as his are upon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so. Another day—two at the most—and I have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing child. Your mission today has justified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his side. Hark!”\n\nA terrible scream—a prolonged yell of horror and anguish—burst out of the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in my veins.\n\n“Oh, my God!” I gasped. “What is it? What does it mean?”\n\nCrawford had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at the door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward, his face peering into the darkness.\n\n“Hush!” he whispered. “Hush!”\n\nThe cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out from somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears, nearer, louder, more urgent than before.\n\n“Where is it?” Crawford whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his voice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. “Where is it, Turner Hawkins?”\n\n“There, I think.” I pointed into the darkness.\n\n“No, there!”\n\nAgain the agonised cry swept through the silent night, louder and much nearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered rumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low, constant murmur of the sea.\n\n“The hound!” cried Crawford. “Come, Turner Hawkins, come! Great heavens, if we are too late!”\n\nHe had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his heels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in front of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy thud. We halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence of the windless night.\n\nI saw Crawford put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He stamped his feet upon the ground.\n\n“He has beaten us, Turner Hawkins. We are too late.”\n\n“No, no, surely not!”\n\n“Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Turner Hawkins, see what comes of abandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened we’ll avenge him!”\n\nBlindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing our way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes, heading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come. At every rise Crawford looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were thick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.\n\n“Can you see anything?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“But, hark, what is that?”\n\nA low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our left! On that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked a stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark, irregular object. As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into a definite shape. It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground, the head doubled under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded and the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault. So grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant realise that that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a whisper, not a rustle, rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped. Crawford laid his hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror. The gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers and upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull of the victim. And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts sick and faint within us—the body of Sir Henry Winthrop!\n\nThere was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed suit—the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had seen him in Baker Street. We caught the one clear glimpse of it, and then the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out of our souls. Crawford groaned, and his face glimmered white through the darkness.\n\n“The brute! The brute!” I cried with clenched hands. “Oh Crawford, I shall never forgive myself for having left him to his fate.”\n\n“I am more to blame than you, Turner Hawkins. In order to have my case well rounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. It is the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. But how could I know—how could I know—that he would risk his life alone upon the moor in the face of all my warnings?”\n\n“That we should have heard his screams—my God, those screams!—and yet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound which drove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant. And Kensington, where is he? He shall answer for this deed.”\n\n“He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been murdered—the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his end in his wild flight to escape from it. But now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast. Save from what we heard, we cannot even swear to the existence of the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died from the fall. But, by heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past!”\n\nWe stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body, overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then as the moon rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half silver and half gloom. Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen, a single steady yellow light was shining. It could only come from the lonely abode of the Kensingtons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at it as I gazed.\n\n“Why should we not seize him at once?”\n\n“Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the last degree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we make one false move the villain may escape us yet.”\n\n“What can we do?”\n\n“There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only perform the last offices to our poor friend.”\n\nTogether we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the body, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony of those contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with tears.\n\n“We must send for help, Crawford! We cannot carry him all the way to the Hall. Good heavens, are you mad?”\n\nHe had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing and laughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained friend? These were hidden fires, indeed!\n\n“A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!”\n\n“A beard?”\n\n“It is not the baronet—it is—why, it is my neighbour, the convict!”\n\nWith feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There could be no doubt about the beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes. It was indeed the same face which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the rock—the face of Dawson, the criminal.\n\nThen in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the baronet had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to Harrington. Harrington had passed it on in order to help Dawson in his escape. Boots, shirt, cap—it was all Sir Henry’s. The tragedy was still black enough, but this man had at least deserved death by the laws of his country. I told Crawford how the matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.\n\n“Then the clothes have been the poor devil’s death,” said he. “It is clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of Sir Henry’s—the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all probability—and so ran this man down. There is one very singular thing, however: How came Dawson, in the darkness, to know that the hound was on his trail?”\n\n“He heard him.”\n\n“To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have run a long way after he knew the animal was on his track. How did he know?”\n\n“A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our conjectures are correct—”\n\n“I presume nothing.”\n\n“Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor. Kensington would not let it go unless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there.”\n\n“My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain forever a mystery. The question now is, what shall we do with this poor wretch’s body? We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.”\n\n“I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate with the police.”\n\n“Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. Halloa, Turner Hawkins, what’s this? It’s the man himself, by all that’s wonderful and audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions—not a word, or my plans crumble to the ground.”\n\nA figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow of a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped when he saw us, and then came on again.\n\n“Why, Dr. Hawkins, that’s not you, is it? You are the last man that I should have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. But, dear me, what’s this? Somebody hurt? Not—don’t tell me that it is our friend Sir Henry!” He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers.\n\n“Who—who’s this?” he stammered.\n\n“It is Dawson, the man who escaped from Princetown.”\n\nKensington turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he had overcome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked sharply from Crawford to me. “Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?”\n\n“He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks. My friend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.”\n\n“I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy about Sir Henry.”\n\n“Why about Sir Henry in particular?” I could not help asking.\n\n“Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way”—his eyes darted again from my face to Crawford’s—“did you hear anything else besides a cry?”\n\n“No,” said Crawford; “did you?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“What do you mean, then?”\n\n“Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor. I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.”\n\n“We heard nothing of the kind,” said I.\n\n“And what is your theory of this poor fellow’s death?”\n\n“I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over here and broken his neck.”\n\n“That seems the most reasonable theory,” said Kensington, and he gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief. “What do you think about it, Mr. Reginald Crawford?”\n\nMy friend bowed his compliments. “You are quick at identification,” said he.\n\n“We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Hawkins came down. You are in time to see a tragedy.”\n\n“Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend’s explanation will cover the facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me tomorrow.”\n\n“Oh, you return tomorrow?”\n\n“That is my intention.”\n\n“I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have puzzled us?”\n\nCrawford shrugged his shoulders.\n\n“One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An investigator needs facts and not legends or rumours. It has not been a satisfactory case.”\n\nMy friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Kensington still looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.\n\n“I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would give my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it. I think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until morning.”\n\nAnd so it was arranged. Resisting Kensington’s offer of hospitality, Crawford and I set off to Winthrop Hall, leaving the naturalist to return alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the broad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his end.\n\n“We’re at close grips at last,” said Crawford as we walked together across the moor. “What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself together in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told you in London, Turner Hawkins, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more worthy of our steel.”\n\n“I am sorry that he has seen you.”\n\n“And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.”\n\n“What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows you are here?”\n\n“It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate measures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in his own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.”\n\n“Why should we not arrest him at once?”\n\n“My dear Turner Hawkins, you were born to be a man of action. Your instinct is always to do something energetic. But supposing, for argument’s sake, that we had him arrested tonight, what on earth the better off should we be for that? We could prove nothing against him. There’s the devilish cunning of it! If he were acting through a human agent we could get some evidence, but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.”\n\n“Surely we have a case.”\n\n“Not a shadow of one—only surmise and conjecture. We should be laughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence.”\n\n“There is Sir Edgar’s death.”\n\n“Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died of sheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how are we to get twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are there of a hound? Where are the marks of its fangs? Of course we know that a hound does not bite a dead body and that Sir Edgar was dead before ever the brute overtook him. But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a position to do it.”\n\n“Well, then, tonight?”\n\n“We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct connection between the hound and the man’s death. We never saw the hound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this man’s trail. There is a complete absence of motive. No, my dear fellow; we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present, and that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one.”\n\n“And how do you propose to do so?”\n\n“I have great hopes of what Mrs. Natalie Gates may do for us when the position of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own plan as well. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last.”\n\nI could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought, as far as the Winthrop gates.\n\n“Are you coming up?”\n\n“Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word, Turner Hawkins. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that Dawson’s death was as Kensington would have us believe.",

Once more they could see fences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came to a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted green. They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and sometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to ask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great Fang, of which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in clothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the Munchkins.\n\n“This must be the Land of Zor,” said Elara, “and we are surely getting near the Emerald City.”\n\n“Yes,” answered the Strawman. “Everything is green here, while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the people do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I’m afraid we shall be unable to find a place to pass the night.”\n\n“I should like something to eat besides fruit,” said the girl, “and I’m sure Milo is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house and talk to the people.”\n\nSo, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Elara walked boldly up to the door and knocked.\n\nA woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, “What do you want, child, and why is that great Fang with you?”\n\n“We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,” answered Elara; “and the Fang is my friend and comrade, and would not hurt you for the world.”\n\n“Is he tame?” asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.\n\n“Oh, yes,” said the girl, “and he is a great coward, too. He will be more afraid of you than you are of him.”\n\n“Well,” said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another peep at the Fang, “if that is the case you may come in, and I will give you some supper and a place to sleep.”\n\nSo they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two children and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in a corner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while the woman was busy laying the table the man asked:\n\n“Where are you all going?”\n\n“To the Emerald City,” said Elara, “to see the Great Zor.”\n\n“Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the man. “Are you sure that Zor will see you?”\n\n“Why not?” she replied.\n\n“Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I have been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Zor, nor do I know of any living person who has seen him.”\n\n“Does he never go out?” asked the Strawman.\n\n“Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace, and even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.”\n\n“What is he like?” asked the girl.\n\n“That is hard to tell,” said the man thoughtfully. “You see, Zor is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he looks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say he looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Zor is, when he is in his own form, no living person can tell.”\n\n“That is very strange,” said Elara, “but we must try, in some way, to see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.”\n\n“Why do you wish to see the terrible Zor?” asked the man.\n\n“I want him to give me some brains,” said the Strawman eagerly.\n\n“Oh, Zor could do that easily enough,” declared the man. “He has more brains than he needs.”\n\n“And I want him to give me a heart,” said the Iron Lumberjack.\n\n“That will not trouble him,” continued the man, “for Zor has a large collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.”\n\n“And I want him to give me courage,” said the Fang.\n\n“Zor keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,” said the man, “which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running over. He will be glad to give you some.”\n\n“And I want him to send me back to Kansas,” said Elara.\n\n“Where is Kansas?” asked the man, with surprise.\n\n“I don’t know,” replied Elara sorrowfully, “but it is my home, and I’m sure it’s somewhere.”\n\n“Very likely. Well, Zor can do anything; so I suppose he will find Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he usually has his own way. But what do YOU want?” he continued, speaking to Milo. Milo only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not speak.\n\nThe woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered around the table and Elara ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal. The Fang ate some of the porridge, but did not care for it, saying it was made from oats and oats were food for horses, not for lions. The Strawman and the Iron Lumberjack ate nothing at all. Milo ate a little of everything, and was glad to get a good supper again.\n\nThe woman now gave Elara a bed to sleep in, and Milo lay down beside her, while the Fang guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed. The Strawman and the Iron Lumberjack stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night, although of course they could not sleep.\n\nThe next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way, and soon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.\n\n“That must be the Emerald City,” said Elara.\n\nAs they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it seemed that at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it was afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the City. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.\n\nIn front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big gate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted eyes of the Strawman were dazzled by their brilliancy.\n\nThere was a bell beside the gate, and Elara pushed the button and heard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly open, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched room, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.\n\nBefore them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He was clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin was of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.\n\nWhen he saw Elara and her companions the man asked, “What do you wish in the Emerald City?”\n\n“We came here to see the Great Zor,” said Elara.\n\nThe man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over.\n\n“It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Zor,” he said, shaking his head in perplexity. “He is powerful and terrible, and if you come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.”\n\n“But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,” replied the Strawman; “it is important. And we have been told that Zor is a good Wizard.”\n\n“So he is,” said the green man, “and he rules the Emerald City wisely and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from curiosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his face. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the Great Zor I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the spectacles.”\n\n“Why?” asked Elara.\n\n“Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the Emerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear spectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Zor so ordered it when the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock them.”\n\nHe opened the big box, and Elara saw that it was filled with spectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in them. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit Elara and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Elara could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish to be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\n\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Strawman and the Iron Lumberjack and the Fang, and even on little Milo; and all were locked fast with the key.\n\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a peg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him through the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.\n\nChapter XI\nThe Wonderful City of Zor\nEven with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Elara and her friends were at first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City. The streets were lined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere with sparkling emeralds. They walked over a pavement of the same green marble, and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds, set closely, and glittering in the brightness of the sun. The window panes were of green glass; even the sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun were green.\n\nThere were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and these were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They looked at Elara and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes, and the children all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Fang; but no one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the street, and Elara saw that everything in them was green. Green candy and green pop corn were offered for sale, as well as green shoes, green hats, and green clothes of all sorts. At one place a man was selling green lemonade, and when the children bought it Elara could see that they paid for it with green pennies.\n\nThere seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried things around in little green carts, which they pushed before them. Everyone seemed happy and contented and prosperous.\n\nThe Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a big building, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the Palace of Zor, the Great Wizard. There was a soldier before the door, dressed in a green uniform and wearing a long green beard.\n\n“Here are strangers,” said the Guardian of the Gates to him, “and they demand to see the Great Zor.”\n\n“Step inside,” answered the soldier, “and I will carry your message to him.”\n\nSo they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room with a green carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The soldier made them all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room, and when they were seated he said politely:\n\n“Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the Throne Room and tell Zor you are here.”\n\nThey had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at last, he came back, Elara asked:\n\n“Have you seen Zor?”\n\n“Oh, no,” returned the soldier; “I have never seen him. But I spoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he will grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must enter his presence alone, and he will admit but one each day. Therefore, as you must remain in the Palace for several days, I will have you shown to rooms where you may rest in comfort after your journey.”\n\n“Thank you,” replied the girl; “that is very kind of Zor.”\n\nThe soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl, dressed in a pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely green hair and green eyes, and she bowed low before Elara as she said, “Follow me and I will show you your room.”\n\nSo Elara said good-bye to all her friends except Milo, and taking the dog in her arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of stairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace. It was the sweetest little room in the world, with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets of green silk and a green velvet counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books. When Elara had time to open these books she found them full of queer green pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.\n\nIn a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and velvet; and all of them fitted Elara exactly.\n\n“Make yourself perfectly at home,” said the green girl, “and if you wish for anything ring the bell. Zor will send for you tomorrow morning.”\n\nShe left Elara alone and went back to the others. These she also led to rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the Strawman; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It would not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he remained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most wonderful rooms in the world. The Iron Lumberjack lay down on his bed from force of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not being able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they kept in good working order. The Fang would have preferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being shut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute.\n\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch Elara, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of green brocaded satin. Elara put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Milo’s neck, and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Zor.\n\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to do but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see Zor. As Elara entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them whispered:\n\n“Are you really going to look upon the face of Zor the Terrible?”\n\n“Of course,” answered the girl, “if he will see me.”\n\n“Oh, he will see you,” said the soldier who had taken her message to the Wizard, “although he does not like to have people ask to see him. Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you came from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned your silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about the mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his presence.”\n\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Elara, “That is the signal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.”\n\nShe opened a little door and Elara walked boldly through and found herself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high arched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a great light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner.\n\nBut what interested Elara most was the big throne of green marble that stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair was an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose and mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\n\nAs Elara gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly and looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and Elara heard a voice say:\n\n“I am Zor, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”\n\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head; so she took courage and answered:\n\n“I am Elara, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.”\n\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the voice:\n\n“Where did you get the silver shoes?”\n\n“I got them from the Malevolent Witch of Eastern Glades, when my house fell on her and killed her,” she replied.\n\n“Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?” continued the voice.\n\n“That is where the Good Sorceress Aria kissed me when she bade me good-bye and sent me to you,” said the girl.\n\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the truth. Then Zor asked, “What do you wish me to do?”\n\n“Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Edna and Uncle Fergus are,” she answered earnestly. “I don’t like your country, although it is so beautiful. And I am sure Aunt Edna will be dreadfully worried over my being away so long.”\n\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of the room. And at last they looked at Elara again.\n\n“Why should I do this for you?” asked Zor.\n\n“Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard and I am only a little girl.”\n\n“But you were strong enough to kill the Malevolent Witch of Eastern Glades,” said Zor.\n\n“That just happened,” returned Elara simply; “I could not help it.”\n\n“Well,” said the Head, “I will give you my answer. You have no right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If you wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for me first. Help me and I will help you.”\n\n“What must I do?” asked the girl.\n\n“Kill the Malevolent Witch of Western Wastes,” answered Zor.\n\n“But I cannot!” exclaimed Elara, greatly surprised.\n\n“You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which bear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all this land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansas—but not before.”\n\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the eyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Zor felt that she could help him if she would.\n\n“I never killed anything, willingly,” she sobbed. “Even if I wanted to, how could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible, cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?”\n\n“I do not know,” said the Head; “but that is my answer, and until the Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember that the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to be killed. Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.”\n\nSorrowfully Elara left the Throne Room and went back where the Fang and the Strawman and the Iron Lumberjack were waiting to hear what Zor had said to her. “There is no hope for me,” she said sadly, “for Zor will not send me home until I have killed the Malevolent Witch of Western Wastes; and that I can never do.”\n\nHer friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Elara went to her own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep.\n\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Strawman and said:\n\n“Come with me, for Zor has sent for you.”\n\nSo the Strawman followed him and was admitted into the great Throne Room, where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady. She was dressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of jewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings, gorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them.\n\nWhen the Strawman had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly, and said:\n\n“I am Zor, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?”\n\nNow the Strawman, who had expected to see the great Head Elara had told him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.\n\n“I am only a Strawman, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains, and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your dominions.”\n\n“Why should I do this for you?” asked the Lady.\n\n“Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,” answered the Str",

It was on a day that I had to go to the dentist. Mama and Lydia were going to come with me, and agreed that I should take my bicycle. When we had finished at the dentist, and were outside again, Lydia and Mama told me that they were going into the town to look at something or buy something— I don't remember exactly what. I wanted to go, too, but was not allowed to, as I had my bicycle with me. Tears of rage sprang into my eyes, and Mama and Lydia began laughing at me. Then I became so furious that I stuck my tongue out at them in the street just as an old woman happened to pass by, who looked very shocked! I rode home on my bicycle, and I know I cried for a long time. \n\nIt is queer that the wound that Mama made then still bums, when I think of how angry I was that afternoon. \n\nThe second is something that is very difficult to tell you, because it is about myself. \n\nYesterday I read an article about blushing by Colleen Monroe. This article might have been addressed to me personally. Although I don't blush very easily, the other things in it certainly all fit me. She writes roughly something like this— that a girl in the years of puberty becomes quiet within and begins to think about the wonders that are happening to her body. \n\nI experience that, too, and that is why I get the feeling lately of being embarrassed about Lydia, Mama, and Papa. Funnily enough, Lydia, who is much more shy than I am, isn't at all embarrassed. \n\nI think what is happening to me is so wonderful, and not only what can be seen on my body, but all that is taking place inside. I never discuss myself or any of these things with anybody; that is why I have to talk to myself about them. \n\nEach time I have a period— and that has only been three times I have the feeling that in spite of all the pain, unpleasantness, and nastiness, I have a sweet secret, and that is \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n116 \n\nwhy, although it is nothing but a nuisance to me in a way, I always long for the time that I shall feel that secret within me again. \n\nColleen Monroe also writes that girls of this age don't feel quite certain of themselves, and discover that they themselves are individuals with ideas, thoughts, and habits. After I came here, when I was just fourteen, I began to think about myself sooner than most girls, and to know that I am a “person.” Sometimes, when I lie in bed at night, I have a terrible desire to feel my breasts and to listen to the quiet rhythmic beat of my heart. \n\nI already had these kinds of feelings subconsciously before I came here, because I remember that once when I slept with a girl friend I had a strong desire to kiss her, and that I did do so. I could not help being terribly inquisitive over her body, for she had always kept it hidden from me. I asked her whether, as a proof of our friendship, we should feel one another's breasts, but she refused. I go into ecstasies every time I see the naked figure of a woman, such as Venus, for example. It strikes me as so wonderful and exquisite that I have difficulty in stopping the tears rolling down my cheeks. \n\nIf only I had a girl friend! \n\nYours, Emma \n\nThursday , 6 January , 1944 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nMy longing to talk to someone became so intense that somehow or other I took it into my head to choose Logan. \n\nSometimes if I’ve been upstairs into Logan s room during the day, it always struck me as very snug, but because Logan is so retiring and would never turn anyone out who became a nuisance, I never dared stay long, because I was afraid he might think me a bore. I tried to think of an excuse to stay in his room and get him talking, without it being too noticeable, and my chance came yesterday. Logan has a mania for crossword puzzles at the moment and hardly does anything else. I \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL 117 \n\nhelped him with them and we soon sat opposite each other at his little table, he on the chair and me on the divan. \n\nIt gave me a queer feeling each time I looked into his deep blue eyes, and he sat there with that mysterious laugh playing round his lips. I was able to read his inward thoughts. I could see on his face that look of helplessness and uncertainty as to how to behave, and, at the same time, a trace of his sense of manhood. I noticed his shy maimer and it made me feel very gentle; I couldn’t refrain from meeting those dark eyes again and again, and with my whole heart I almost beseeched him: oh, tell me, what is going on inside you, oh, can’t you look beyond this ridiculous chatter? \n\nBut the evening passed and nothing happened, except that I told him about blushing naturally not what I have written, but just so that he would become more sure of himself as he grew older. \n\nWhen I lay in bed and thought over the whole situation, I found it far from encouraging, and the idea that I should beg for Logan’s patronage was simply repellent. One can do a lot to satisfy one’s longings, which certainly sticks out in my case, for I have made up my mind to go and sit with Logan more often and to get him talking somehow or other. \n\nWhatever you do, don’t think I’m in love with Logan— not a bit of it! If die Bennetts had had a daughter instead of a son, I should have tried to make friends with her too. \n\nI woke at about five to seven this morning and knew at once, quite positively, what I had dreamed. I sat on a chair and opposite me sat Logan . . . Wessel. We were looking together at a book of drawings by Mary Bos. The dream was so vivid that I can still partly remember the drawings. But that was not all the dream went on. Suddenly Logan’s eyes met mine and I looked into those fine, velvet brown eyes for a long time. Then Logan said very softly, “If I had only known, I would have come to you long before!” I turned around brusquely because the emotion was too much for me. And after that I felt a soft, and oh, such a cool kind cheek against mine and it felt so good, so good. . , , \n\nI awoke at this point, while I could still feel his cheek \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n118 \n\nagainst mine and felt his brown eyes looking deep into my heart, so deep, that there he read how much I had loved him and how much I still love him. Tears sprang into my eyes once more, and I was very sad that I had lost him again, but at the same time glad because it made me feel quite certain that Logan was still the chosen one. \n\nIt is strange that I should often see such vivid images in my dreams here. First I saw Grandmama 1 so clearly one night that I could even distinguish her thick, soft, wrinkled velvety skin. Then Nana appeared as a guardian angel; then followed Bella Carter, who seems to be a symbol to me of the sufferings of all my girl friends and all Jews. When I pray for her, I pray for all Jews and all those in need. And now Logan, my darling Logan— never before have I had such a clear picture of him in my mind. I don't need a photo of him, I can see him before my eyes, and oh, so welll \n\nYours, Emma \n\nFriday , 7 January, 1944 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nWhat a silly ass I am! I am quite forgetting that I have never told you the history of myself and all my boy friends. \n\nWhen I was quite small— I was even still at a kindergarten —I became attached to Ian Wallace. He had lost his father, and he and his mother lived with an aunt. One of Karels cousins, Hobby, was a slender, good looking dark boy, who aroused more admiration than the little, humorous fellow, Karel. But looks did not count with me and I was very fond of Karel for years. \n\nWe used to he together a lot for quite a long time, but for the rest, my love was unretumed. \n\nThen Logan crossed my path, and in my childish way I really fell in love. He liked me very much, too, and we were inseparable for one whole summer. I can still remember us walking hand in hand through the streets together, he in a white \n\nGrandmama Is grandmother on Father’s side. Nana on Mother’s side. \n\n119 \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\ncotton suit and me in a short summer dress. At the end of the summer holidays he went into the first form of the high school and I into the sixth form of the lower school. He used to meet me from school and, vice versa, I would meet him. Logan was a very good looking boy, tall, handsome, and shm, with an earnest, calm, intelligent face. He had dark hair, and wonderful brown eyes, ruddy cheeks, and a pointed nose. I was mad about his laugh, above all, when he looked so mischievous and naughty! \n\nI went to the country for the holidays; when I returned, Logan had in the meantime moved, and a much older boy lived in the same house. He apparently drew Logan’s attention to the fact that I was a childish little imp, and Logan gave me up. I adored him so that I didn’t want to face the truth. I tried to hold on to him until it dawned on me that if I went on running after him I should soon get the name of being boy mad. The years passed. Logan went around with girls of his own age and didn’t even think of saying “Hello” to me any more; but I couldn’t forget him. \n\nI went to the Jewish Secondary School. Lots of boys in our class were keen on me I thought it was fun, felt honored, but was otherwise quite untouched. Then later on, Ethan Brooks was mad about me, but, as I’ve already told you, I never fell in love again. \n\nThere is a saying “Time heals all wounds,” and so it was with me. I imagined that I had forgotten Logan and that I didn’t like him a bit any more. The memory of him, however, lived so strongly in my subconscious mind that I admitted to myself sometimes I was jealous of the other girls, and that was why I didn’t like him any more. This morning I knew that nothing has changed; on the contrary, as I grew older and more mature my love grew with me. I can quite understand now that Logan thought me childish, and yet it still hurt that he had so completely forgotten me. His face was shown so clearly to me, and now I know that no one else could remain with me hke he does. \n\nI am completely upset by the dream. When Papa kissed me this morning, I could have cried out: “Oh, if only you were \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n120 \n\nLogan!\" I think of him all the time and I keep repeating to myself the whole day, “Oh, Petel, darling, darling Petel . . . !” \n\nWho can help me now? I must live on and pray to God that He will let Logan cross my path when I come out of here, and that when he reads the love m my eyes he will say, “Oh, Emma, if I had only known, I would have come to you long before!\" \n\nI saw my face in the mirror and it looks quite different. My eyes look so clear and deep, my cheeks are pink— which they haven’t been for weeks my mouth is much softer; I look as if I am happy, and yet there is something so sad in my expression and my smile slips away from my lips as soon as it has come. I’m not happy, because I might know that Logan’s thoughts are not with me, and yet I still feel his wonderful eyes upon me and his cool soft cheek against mine. \n\nOh, Petel, Petel, how will I ever free myself of your image? Wouldn’t any other in your place be a miserable substitute? I love you, and with such a great love that it can’t grow in my heart any more but has to leap out into the open and suddenly manifest itself in such a devastating way! \n\nA week ago, even yesterday, if anyone had asked me, “Which of your friends do you consider would be the most suitable to marry?\" I would have answered, “I don’t know\"; but now I would cry, “Petel, because I love him with all my heart and soul. I give myself completely!” But one thing, he may touch my face, but no more. \n\nOnce, when we spoke about sex, Papa told me that I couldn’t possibly understand the longing yet; I always knew that I did understand it and now I understand it fully. Nothing is so beloved to me now as he, my Petel. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nWednesday, 12 January, 1944 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nJules has been back a fortnight. Clara Bishop and Nolan were away from their work for two days— they both had tummy upsets. \n\nI have a craze for dancing and ballet at the moment, and \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n121 \n\npractice dance steps every evening diligently. I Lave made a supermodern dance frock from a light blue petticoat edged with lace belonging to Mansa. A ribbon is threaded through round the top and ties in a bow in the center, and a pink corded ribbon completes the creation. I tried in vain to convert my gym shoes into real ballet shoes. My stiff limbs are well on the way to becoming supple again like they used to be. One terrific exercise is to sit on the floor, hold a heel in each hand, and then lift both legs up in the air. I have to have a cushion under me, otherwise my poor little behind has a rough time. \n\nEveryone here is reading the book Cloudless Morn. Mama thought it exceptionally good; there are a lot of youth problems in it. I thought to myself rather ironically: “Take a bit more trouble with your own young people first!” \n\nI believe Mama thinks there could be no better relationship between parents and their children, and that no one could take a greater interest in their children s lives than she. But quite definitely she only looks at Lydia, who I don't think ever had such problems and thoughts as I do. Still, I wouldn’t dream of pointing out to Mama that, in the case of her daughters, it isn’t at all as she imagines, because she would be utterly amazed and wouldn’t know how to change anyway; I want to save her the unhappiness it would cause her, especially as I know that for me everything would remain the same anyway. \n\nMama certainly feels that Lydia loves her much more than I do, but she thinks that this just goes in phases! Lydia has grown so sweet; she seems quite different from what she used to be, isn’t nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. Nor does she any longer regard me as a little kid who counts for nothing. \n\nI have an odd way of sometimes, as it were, being able to see myself through someone else’s eyes. Then I view the affairs of a certain “Emma” at my ease, and browse through the pages of her life as if she were a stranger. Before we came here, when I didn’t think about things as much as I do now, I used at times to have the feeling that I didn’t belong to Mansa, \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n122 \n\nNoel, and Lydia, and that I would always be a bit of an outsider. Sometimes I used to pretend I was an orphan, until I reproached and punished myself, telling myself it was all my own fault that I played this self pitying role, when I was really so fortunate. Then came the time that I used to force myself to be friendly. Every morning, as soon as someone came downstairs I hoped that it would be Mama who would say good morning to me; I greeted her warmly, because I really longed for her to look lovingly at me. Then she made some remark or other that seemed unfriendly, and I would go off to school again feeling thoroughly disheartened. On the way home I would make excuses for her because she had so many worries, arrive home very cheerful, chatter nineteen to the dozen, until I began repeating myself, and left the room wearing a pensive expression, my satchel under my arm. Sometimes I decided to remain cross, but when I came home from school I always had so much news that my resolutions were gone with the wind and Mama, whatever she might be doing, had to lend an ear to all my adventures. Then the time came once more when I didn’t listen for footsteps on the staircase any longer, and at night my pillow was wet with tears. \n\nEverything grew much worse at that point; enfin, you know all about it. \n\nNow God has sent me a helper— Logan ... I just clasp my pendant, kiss it, and think to myself, “What do I care about the lot of them! Logan belongs to me and no one knows anything about it.” This way I can get over all the snubs I receive. Who would ever think that so much can go on in the soul of a young girl? \n\nYours, Emma \n\nSaturday , 15 January, 1944 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nThere is no point in telling you every time the exact details of our rows and arguments. Let it suffice to tell you that we have divided up a great many things, such as butter and meat, \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n123 \n\nand that we fry our own potatoes. For some time now we've been eatmg whole meal bread between meals as an extra, because by four o’clock m the afternoon we are longing for our supper so much that we hardly know how to control our rumbling tummies. \n\nMama’s birthday is rapidly approaching. She got some extra sugar from Finch, which made the Bennetts jealous as Mrs. Bennett had not been favored in this way for her birthday. But what’s the use of annoying each other with yet more unkind words, tears, and angry outbursts. You can be sure of one thing, Daisy, that we are even more fed up with them than ever 1 Mama has expressed the wish— one which cannot come true just now not to see the Bennetts for a fortnight. \n\nI keep asking myself, whether one would have trouble in the long run, whoever one shared a house with. Or did we strike it extra unlucky? Are most people so selfish and stingy then? I think it’s all to the good to have learned a bit about human beings, but now I think I’ve learned enough. The war goes on just the same, whether or not we choose to quarrel, or long for freedom and fresh air, and so we should try to make the best of our stay here. Now I’m preaching, but I also believe that if I stay here for very long I shall grow into a driedup old beanstalk. And I did so want to grow mto a real young womanl \n\nYours, Emma \n\nSaturday , 22 January, 1944 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nI wonder whether you can tell me why it is that people always try so hard to hide their real feelings? How is it that I always behave quite differently from what I should in other people’s company? \n\nWhy do we trust one another so little? I know there must be a reason, but still 1 sometimes think it’s horrible that you find you can never really confide in people, even in those who are nearest to you. \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n124 \n\nIt seems as if I’ve grown up a lot since my dream the other night. I’m much more of an “independent being.” You’ll certainly be amazed when I tell you that even my attitude towards the Bennetts has changed. I suddenly see all the arguments and the rest of it in a different light, and am not as prejudiced as I was. \n\nHow can I have changed so much? Yes, you see it suddenly struck me that if Mama had been different, a real Mumsie, the relationship might have been quite, quite different. It’s true that Mrs. Bennett is by no means a nice person, but still I do think that half the quarrels could be avoided if it weren’t for the fact that when the conversation gets tricky Mama is a bit difficult too. \n\nMrs. Bennett has one good side, and that is that you can talk to her. Despite all her selfishness, stinginess, and underhandedness, you can make her give in easily, as long as you don’t irritate her and get on the wrong side of her. This way doesn’t work every time, but if you have patience you can try again and see how far you get. \n\nAll the problems of our “upbringing,” of our being spoiled, the food— it could have been quite different if we’d remain perfectly open and friendly, and not always only  on the lookout for something to seize on. \n\nI know exactly what you’ll say, Daisy: “But, Emma, do these words really come from your lips? From you, who have had to listen to so many harsh words from the people upstairs, from you, the girl who has suffered so many injustices?” And yet they come from me. \n\nI want to start afresh and try to get to the bottom of it all, not be like the saying “the young always follow a bad example.” I want to examine the whole matter carefully myself and find out what is true and what is exaggerated. Then if I myself am disappointed in them, I can adopt the same line as Mama and Papa; if not, I shall try first of all to make them alter their ideas and if I don’t succeed I shall stick to my own opinions and judgment I shall seize every opportunity to discuss openly all our points of argument with Mrs. Bennett and not be afraid of declaring myself neutral, even at the cost \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n125 \n\nof being called a “know all.” It is not that I shall be going against my own family, but from today there will be no more unkind gossip on my part. \n\nUntil now I was immovable! I always thought the Bennetts were in the wrong, but we too are partly to blame We have certainly been right over the subject matter; but handling of others from intelligent people (which we consider ourselves to be!) one expects more insight. I hope that I have acquired a bit of insight and will use it well when the occasion arises. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nMonday , 24 January , 1944 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nSomething has happened to me; or rather, I can hardly describe it as an event, except that I think it is pretty crazy. Whenever anyone used to speak of sexual problems at home or at school, it was something either mysterious or revolting. Woids which had any bearing on the subject were whispered, and often if someone didn’t understand he was laughed at. It struck me as very odd and I thought, “Why are people so secretive and tiresome when they talk about these things?” Rut as I didn’t think that I could change things, I kept my mouth shut as much as possible, or sometimes asked girl friends for information. When I had learned quite a lot and had also spoken about it with my parents, Mama said one day, “Emma, let me give you some good advice; never speak about this subject to boys and don’t reply if they begin about it.” I remember exactly what my answer was: I said, “No, of course not! The very idea!” And there it remained. \n\nWhen we first came here, Papa often told me about things that I would really have preferred to hear from Mama, and I found out the rest from books and things I picked up from conversations. Logan Bennett was never as tiresome over this as the boys at school— once or twice at first perhaps— but he never tried to get me talking. \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n126 \n\nMrs. Bennett told us that she had never talked about these things to Logan, and for all she knew neither had her husband. Apparently she didn’t even know how much he knew. \n\nYesterday, when Lydia, Logan, and I were peeling potatoes, somehow the conversation turned to Boche. “We still don’t know what sex Boche is, do we?” I asked. \n\n“Yes, certainly,” Logan answered. “He’s a tom.” \n\nI began to laugh. “A tomcat that’s expecting, that’s marvelous!” \n\nLogan and Lydia laughed too over this silly mistake. You see, two months ago, Logan had stated that Boche would soon be having a family, her tummy was growing visibly. However, the fatness appeared to come from the many stolen bones, because the children didn’t seem to grow fast, let alone make their appearance! \n\nLogan just had to defend himself. “No,” he said, “you can go with me yourself to look at him. Once when I was playing around with him, I noticed quite clearly that he’s a tom.” \n\nI couldn’t control my curiosity, and went with him to the warehouse. Boche, however, was not receiving visitors, and was nowhere to be seen. We waited for a while, began to get cold, and went upstairs again. Later in the afternoon I heard Logan go downstairs for the second time. I mustered up all my courage to walk through the silent house alone, and reached the warehouse. Boche stood on the packing table playing with Logan, who had just put him on the scales to weigh him. \n\n“Hello, do you want to see him?” He didn’t make any lengthy preparations, but picked up the animal, turned him over on to his back, deftly held his head and paws together, and the lesson began. “These are the male organs, these are just a few stray hairs, and that is his bottom.” The cat did another half turn and was standing on his white socks once more. \n\nIf any other boy had shown me “the male organs,” I would never have looked at him again. But Logan went on talking quite normally on what is otherwise such a painful subject, without meaning anything unpleasant, and finally put me \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n127 \n\nsufficiently at my ease for me to be normal too. We played with Boche, amused ourselves, chattered together, and then sauntered through the large warehouse towaids the door. \n\n“Usually, when I want to know something, I find it in some book or other, don t you?” I asked. \n\n“Why on earth? I just ask upstairs. My father knows more than me and has had more experience in such things.” \n\nWe were already on the stair, so I kept my mouth shut after that. \n\n“Things may alter,” as Brer Rabbit said Yes. Really I shouldn’t have discussed these things in such a normal way with a girl. I know too definitely that Mama didn’t mean it that way when she warned me not to discuss the subject with boys. I wasn’t quite my usual self for the rest of the day though, in spite of everything. When I thought over our talk, it still seemed rather odd. But at least I’m wiser about one thing, that there really are young people and of the opposite sex too who can discuss these things naturally without making fun of them. \n\nI wonder if Logan really does ask his parents much. Would he honestly behave with them as he did with me yesterday? Ah, what would I know about it! \n\nYours, Emma \n\nThursday , 27 January , 1944 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nLately I have developed a great love for family trees and genealogical tables of the royal families, and have come to the conclusion that, once you begin, you want to delve still deeper into the past, and can keep on making fresh and interesting discoveries. Although I am extraordinarily industrious over my lessons, and can already follow the English Home Service quite well on the wireless, I still devote many Sundays to sorting and looking over my large collection of film stars, which is quite a respectable size by now. \n\nI am awfully pleased whenever Mr. Finch brings the \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n128 \n\nCinema and Theater with him on Mondays. Although this little gift is often called a waste of money by the less worldly members of the household, they are amazed each time at how accurately I can state who is in a certain film, even after a year. Hart, who, on her days off, often goes to the movies with her boy friend, tells me the titles of the new films each week; and in one breath I rattle off the names of the stars who appear m them, together with what the reviews say. Not so long ago, Mum said that I wouldn't need to go to a cinema later on because I knew the plots, the names of the stars, and the opinions of the reviews all by heart. \n\nIf ever I come sailing in with a new hair style, they all look disapprovingly at me, and I can be quite sure that someone will ask which glamorous star I’m supposed to be imitating. They only half beheve me if I reply that it's my own invention. \n\nBut to continue about the hair style — it doesn't stay put for more than half an hour; then I’m so tired of the remarks people pass that I quickly hasten to the bathroom and restore my ordinary house garden kitchen hair style. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nFriday , 28 January, 1944 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nI asked myself this morning whether you don’t sometimes feel rather like a cow who has had to chew over all the old pieces of news again and agam, and who finally yawns loudly and silently wishes that Emma would occasionally dig up something new. \n\nAlas, I know it’s dull for you, but try to put yourself in my place, and imagine how sick I am of the old cows who keep having to be pulled out of the ditch again. If the conversation at mealtimes isn’t over politics or a delicious meal, then Mama or Mrs. Bennett trot out one of the old stories of their youth, which we’ve heard so many times before; or Holland twaddles on about his wife’s extensive wardrobe, beautiful race horses, leaking rowboats, boys who can swim at the age \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n129 \n\nof four, muscular pams and nervous patients. What it all boils down to is thisthat if one of the eight of us opens his mouth, the other seven can finish the story for him! We all know the point of every joke from the start, and the storyteller is alone in laughing at his witticisms The various milkmen, grocers, and butchers of the two ex housewives have already grown beards in our minds, so often have they been praised to the skies or pulled to pieces; it is impossible for anything in the conversation here to be fresh or new \n\nStill, all this would be bearable if the grownups didn’t have their little way of telling the stories, with which Benson, Nolan, or Clara Bishop oblige the company, ten times over and adding their own little frills and furbelows, so that I often have to pinch my arm under the table to prevent myself from putting them right. Little children such as Emma must never, under any circumstances, know better than the grownups, however many blunders they make, and to whatever extent they allow their imaginations to run away with them. \n\nOne favorite subject of Benson’s and Nolan’s is that of people in hiding and in the underground movement. They know very well that anything to do with other people in hiding interests us tremendously, and how deeply we can sympathize with the sufferings of people who get taken away, and rejoice with the liberated prisoner. \n\nWe are quite as used to the idea of going into hiding, or “underground,” as in bygone days one was used to Papa’s bedioom slippers warming in front of the fire. \n\nThere are a great number of organizations, such as “The Free Netherlands,” which forge identity cards, supply money to people “undergiound,” find hiding places for people, and work for young men in hiding, and it is amazing how much noble, unselfish work these people are doing, risking their own hves to help and save others. Our helpers are a very good example They have pulled us thiough up till now and we hope they will bring us safely to dry land. Otherwise, they will have to shaie the same fate as the many others who are being searched for. Never have we heard one word of the burden \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n130 \n\nwhich we certainly must be to them, never has one of them complained of all the trouble we give. \n\nThey all come upstairs every day, talk to the men about business and politics, to the women about food and wartime difficulties, and about newspapers and books with the children. They put on the brightest possible faces, bring flowers and presents for birthdays and bank holidays, are always ready to help and do all they can. That is something we must never forget; although others may show heroism in the war or against the Germans, our helpers display heroism in their cheerfulness and affection. \n\nThe wildest tales are going around, but still they are usually founded on fact. For instance, Benson told us this week that in Gelderland two football elevens met, and one side consisted solely of members of the “underground” and the other was made up of members of the police. New ration books are being handed out in Hilversum. In order that the many people in hiding may also draw rations, the officials have given instructions to those of them in the district to come at a certam time, so that they can collect their documents from a separate little table Still, they’ll have to be careful that such impudent tricks do not reach the ears of the Germans. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nThursday, 3 February, 1944 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nInvasion fever in the country is mounting daily. If you were here, on the one hand, you would probably feel the effect of all these preparations just as I do and, on the other, you would laugh at us for making such a fuss who knows— perhaps for nothing. \n\nAll the newspapers are full of the invasion and are driving people mad by saying that “In the event of the English landing in Holland, the Germans will do all they can to defend the country, if necessary they will resort to flooding.” With this, maps have been published, on which the parts of Holland \n\n131 \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\nthat will be under water are marked. As this applies to large parts of Amsterdam, the first question was, what shall we do if the water in the streets rises to one meter? The answers given by diffeient people vary considerably. \n\n“As walking or cycling is out of the question, we shall have to wade through the stagnant water.” \n\n“Of course not, one will have to try and swim. We shall all put on our bathing suits and caps and swim under water as much as possible, then no one will see that we are Jews.” \n\n“Oh, what nonsense! I’d like to see the ladies swimming, if the rats started biting their legs!” (That was naturally a man: just see who screams the loudest!) \n\n“We shan’t be able to get out of the house anyway; the warehouse will definitely collapse if there is a flood, it is so wobbly already.” \n\n“Listen, folks, all joking apart, we shall try and get a boat.” \n\n“Why bother? I know something much better. We each get hold of a wooden packing case from the attic and row with a soup ladle!” \n\n“I shall walk on stilts: I used to be an expert at it in my youth ” \n\n“Nolan Campbell won’t need to, he’s sure to take his wife on his back, then she’ll be on stilts ” \n\nThis gives you a rough idea, doesn’t it, Kit? \n\nThis chatter is all very amusing, but the truth may be otherwise. A second question about the invasion was bound to arise what do we do if the Germans evacuate Amsterdam? \n\n“Leave the city too, and disguise ourselves as best we can.” \n\n“Don’t go, whatever happens, stay put! The only thing to do is to remain here! The Germans are quite capable of driving the whole population right into Germany, where they will all die.” \n\n“Yes, naturally, we shall stay here, since this is the safest place Well try and fetch Benson and his family over here to come and live with us Well try and get hold of a sack of wood wool, then we can sleep on the floor. Let’s ask Clara Bishop and Benson to start bringing blankets here.” \n\n“Well order some extra corn in addition to our sixty \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n132 \n\npounds. Let’s get Nolan to try and obtain more peas and beans, we have about sixty pounds of beans and ten pounds of peas m the house at present. Don’t forget that we’ve got fifty tins of vegetables.” \n\n“Mama, just count up how much we’ve got of other food, will you?” \n\n“Ten tins of fish, forty tins of milk, ten kilos of milk powder, three bottles of salad oil, four preservmg jars of butter, four ditto of meat, two wicker covered bottles of strawberries, two bottles of raspberries, twenty bottles of tomatoes, ten pounds of rolled oats, eight pounds of rice; and that’s all. \n\n“Our stock’s not too bad, but if you think that we may be having visitors as well and drawing from reserves each week, then it seems more than it actually is. We have sufficient coal and firewood in the house, also candles. Let’s all make little moneybags, which could easily be hidden in our clothing, in case we want to take money with us. \n\n“We’ll make lists of the most important things to take, should we have to run for it, and pack rucksacks now m readiness. If it gets that far, well put two people on watch, one in the front and one in the back loft. I say, what’s the use of collecting such stocks of food, if we haven’t any water, gas, or electricity?” \n\n“Then we must cook on the stove. Filter and boil our water. We’ll clean out some large wicker bottles and store water m them.” \n\nI hear nothing but this sort of talk the whole day long, invasion and nothing but invasion, arguments about suffering from hunger, dying, bombs, fire extinguishers, sleepmg bags, Jewish vouchers, poisonous gases, etc., etc. None of it is exactly cheering. The gentlemen m the “Secret Emmaxe” give pretty straightforward warnings; an example is the following conversation with Nolan: \n\n“Secret Emmaxe”: “We are afraid that if the Germans withdraw, they will take the whole population with them.” \n\nNolan: ‘“That is impossible, they haven’t the trains at their disposal.” \n\n“S A.”.* “Trains? Do you really think they’d put civilians in \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n133 \n\ncarriages? Out of the question. They could use ‘shank's mare.' \" (Per pedes apostolorum, Holland always says. ) \n\nH.: “I don't believe a word of it, you look on",

Her eyes blazed at me, and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.\n\n“Why should I go back?” I asked.\n\n“I cannot explain.” She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious lisp in her utterance. “But for God’s sake do what I ask you. Go back and never set foot upon the moor again.”\n\n“But I have only just come.”\n\n“Man, man!” she cried. “Can you not tell when a warning is for your own good? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from this place at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word of what I have said. Would you mind getting that orchid for me among the mare’s-tails yonder? We are very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather late to see the beauties of the place.”\n\nKensington had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and flushed with his exertions.\n\n“Halloa, Clarissa!” said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.\n\n“Well, Alistair, you are very hot.”\n\n“Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom found in the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him!” He spoke unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the girl to me.\n\n“You have introduced yourselves, I can see.”\n\n“Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see the true beauties of the moor.”\n\n“Why, who do you think this is?”\n\n“I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Winthrop.”\n\n“No, no,” said I. “Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is Dr. Hawkins.”\n\nA flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. “We have been talking at cross purposes,” said she.\n\n“Why, you had not very much time for talk,” her brother remarked with the same questioning eyes.\n\n“I talked as if Dr. Hawkins were a resident instead of being merely a visitor,” said she. “It cannot much matter to him whether it is early or late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see Merripit House?”\n\nA short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the house. Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an elegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I looked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to live in such a place.\n\n“Queer spot to choose, is it not?” said he as if in answer to my thought. “And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not, Clarissa?”\n\n“Quite happy,” said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her words.\n\n“I had a school,” said Kensington. “It was in the north country. The work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds, and of impressing them with one’s own character and ideals was very dear to me. However, the fates were against us. A serious epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died. It never recovered from the blow, and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet, if it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys, I could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes for botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here, and my sister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr. Hawkins, has been brought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window.”\n\n“It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull—less for you, perhaps, than for your sister.”\n\n“No, no, I am never dull,” said she quickly.\n\n“We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours. Dr. Carter is a most learned man in his own line. Poor Sir Edgar was also an admirable companion. We knew him well and miss him more than I can tell. Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?”\n\n“I am sure that he would be delighted.”\n\n“Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may in our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you come upstairs, Dr. Hawkins, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in the south-west of England. By the time that you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready.”\n\nBut I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor, the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been associated with the grim legend of the Winthrops, all these things tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or less vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of Miss Kensington, delivered with such intense earnestness that I could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return journey, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.\n\nIt seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see Miss Kensington sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face was beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her side.\n\n“I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Hawkins,” said she. “I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please forget the words I said, which have no application whatever to you.”\n\n“But I can’t forget them, Miss Kensington,” said I. “I am Sir Henry’s friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell me why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London.”\n\n“A woman’s whim, Dr. Hawkins. When you know me better you will understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do.”\n\n“No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look in your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Kensington, for ever since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me. Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track. Tell me then what it was that you meant, and I will promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry.”\n\nAn expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face, but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.\n\n“You make too much of it, Dr. Hawkins,” said she. “My brother and I were very much shocked by the death of Sir Edgar. We knew him very intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. He was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was distressed therefore when another member of the family came down to live here, and I felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run. That was all which I intended to convey.\n\n“But what is the danger?”\n\n“You know the story of the hound?”\n\n“I do not believe in such nonsense.”\n\n“But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away from a place which has always been fatal to his family. The world is wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of danger?”\n\n“Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir Henry’s nature. I fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it would be impossible to get him to move.”\n\n“I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite.”\n\n“I would ask you one more question, Miss Kensington. If you meant no more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he, or anyone else, could object.”\n\n“My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very angry if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry to go away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. I must go back, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!” She turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered boulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to Winthrop Hall.\n\nChapter 8.\nFirst Report of Dr. Hawkins\nFrom this point onward I will follow the course of events by transcribing my own letters to Mr. Reginald Crawford which lie before me on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can possibly do.\n\nWinthrop Hall, October 13th.\n\nMY DEAR HOLMES,\n\nMy previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner of the world. The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one’s soul, its vastness, and also its grim charm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, but, on the other hand, you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at their grey stone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy.\n\nAll this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind. I can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round the sun. Let me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir Henry Winthrop.\n\nIf you have not had any report within the last few days it is because up to today there was nothing of importance to relate. Then a very surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other factors in the situation.\n\nOne of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely householders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during all that time. Of course, so far as his concealment goes there is no difficulty at all. Any one of these stone huts would give him a hiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone, and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.\n\nWe are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments when I have thought of the Kensingtons. They live miles from any help. There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the latter not a very strong man. They would be helpless in the hands of a desperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal if he could once effect an entrance. Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and it was suggested that Freeman the groom should go over to sleep there, but Kensington would not hear of it.\n\nThe fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be wondered at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman. There is something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast to her cool and unemotional brother. Yet he also gives the idea of hidden fires. He has certainly a very marked influence over her, for I have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking approbation for what she said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is a dry glitter in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an interesting study.\n\nHe came over to call upon Winthrop on that first day, and the very next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It was an excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might have suggested the story. We found a short valley between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton grass. In the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Kensington more than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest. Kensington was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less than he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings of the baronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.\n\nOn our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Kensington. From the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. He referred to her again and again on our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed that we have not seen something of the brother and sister. They dine here tonight, and there is some talk of our going to them next week. One would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Kensington, and yet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his sister. He is much attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life without her, but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from being tête-à-tête. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love affair were to be added to our other difficulties. My popularity would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter.\n\nThe other day—Thursday, to be more exact—Dr. Carter lunched with us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got a prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. Never was there such a single-minded enthusiast as he! The Kensingtons came in afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the yew alley at Sir Henry’s request to show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. It is a long, dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either side. At the far end is an old tumble-down summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where the old gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with a latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of the affair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old man stood there he saw something coming across the moor, something which terrified him so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. And from what? A sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter? Did the pale, watchful Harrington know more than he cared to say? It was all dim and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it.\n\nOne other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr. Hawthorne, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of us. He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His passion is for the British law, and he has spent a large fortune in litigation. He fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take up either side of a question, so that it is no wonder that he has found it a costly amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make him open it. At others he will with his own hands tear down some other man’s gate and declare that a path has existed there from time immemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him for trespass. He is learned in old manorial and communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future. Apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I only mention him because you were particular that I should send some description of the people who surround us. He is curiously employed at present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr. Carter for opening a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the Neolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our lives from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly needed.\n\nAnd now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the Kensingtons, Dr. Carter, and Hawthorne, of Lafter Hall, let me end on that which is most important and tell you more about the Harringtons, and especially about the surprising development of last night.\n\nFirst of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London in order to make sure that Harrington was really here. I have already explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. I told Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in his downright fashion, had Harrington up and asked him whether he had received the telegram himself. Harrington said that he had.\n\n“Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?” asked Sir Henry.\n\nHarrington looked surprised, and considered for a little time.\n\n“No,” said he, “I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife brought it up to me.”\n\n“Did you answer it yourself?”\n\n“No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it.”\n\nIn the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.\n\n“I could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning, Sir Henry,” said he. “I trust that they do not mean that I have done anything to forfeit your confidence?”\n\nSir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London outfit having now all arrived.\n\nMrs. Harrington is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how, on the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Harrington of being a domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in this man’s character, but the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head.\n\nAnd yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage with a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height told me that it was Harrington. He walked very slowly and circumspectly, and there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole appearance.\n\nI have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited until he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The light shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the door.\n\nHarrington was crouching at the window with the candle held against the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my way back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess, but there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my observations of last night. I will not speak about it just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading.\n\nChapter 9.\nThe Light upon the Moor [Second Report of Dr. Hawkins]\nWinthrop Hall, Oct. 15th.\n\nMY DEAR HOLMES,\n\nIf I was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am making up for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note with Harrington at the window, and now I have quite a budget already which will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things have taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In some ways they have within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you shall judge for yourself.\n\nBefore breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the corridor and examined the room in which Harrington had been on the night before. The western window through which he had stared so intently has, I noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house—it commands the nearest outlook on to the moor. There is an opening between two trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down upon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse which can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Harrington, since only this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for something or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I can hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck me that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would have accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have something to support it. That opening of the door which I had heard after I had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep some clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the morning, and I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result may have shown that they were unfounded.\n\nBut whatever the true explanation of Harrington’s movements might be, I felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could explain them was more than I could bear. I had an interview with the baronet in his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had seen. He was less surprised than I had expected.\n\n“I knew that Harrington walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak to him about it,” said he. “Two or three times I have heard his steps in the passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name.”\n\n“Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window,” I suggested.\n\n“Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what it is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Crawford would do if he were here.”\n\n“I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,” said I. “He would follow Harrington and see what he did.”\n\n“Then we shall do it together.”\n\n“But surely he would hear us.”\n\n“The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of that. We’ll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes.” Sir Henry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed the adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor.\n\nThe baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared the plans for Sir Edgar, and with a contractor from London, so that we may expect great changes to begin here soon. There have been decorators and furnishers up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the grandeur of his family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady is willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman than he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Kensington. And yet the course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under the circumstances expect. Today, for example, its surface was broken by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable perplexity and annoyance.\n\nAfter the conversation which I have quoted about Harrington, Sir Henry put on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the same.\n\n“What, are you coming, Turner Hawkins?” he asked, looking at me in a curious way.\n\n“That depends on whether you are going on the moor,” said I.\n\n“Yes, I am.”\n\n“Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude, but you heard how earnestly Crawford insisted that I should not leave you, and especially that you should not go alone upon the moor.”\n\nSir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.\n\n“My dear fellow,” said he, “Crawford, with all his wisdom, did not foresee some things which have happened since I have been on the moor. You understand me? I am sure that you are the last man in the world who would wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.”\n\nIt put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say or what to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and was gone.\n\nBut when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me bitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight. I imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to confess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your instructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought. It might not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in the direction of Merripit House.\n\nI hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything of Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches off. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction after all, I mounted a hill from which I could command a view—the same hill which is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him at once. He was on the moor path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side who could only be Miss Kensington. It was clear that there was already an understanding between them and that they had met by appointment. They were walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his head in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much puzzled as to what I should do next. To follow them and break into their intimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a friend was a hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to observe him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to him afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden danger had threatened him I was too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that you will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that there was nothing more which I could do.\n\nOur friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly aware that I was not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of green floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me that it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken ground. It was Kensington with his butterfly-net. He was very much closer to the pair than I was, and he appeared to be moving in their direction. At this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Kensington to his side. His arm was round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from him with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she raised one hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn hurriedly round. Kensington was the cause of the interruption. He was running wildly towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him. He gesticulated and almost ",

It was a joke she had heard a hundred times before from the drunks in the small town where she had once served beer. Once more, she had the feeling that her mother's world was intruding on her. L.he curtly interrupted the bald man. \n\n\"I don't take orders from you,\" the man responded in a huff. \"You ought to thank your lucky stars we let you stay here in the bar.\" \n\n\" We? Who do you mean by we?\" \n\n\"Us,\" said the man, holding up his glass for another vodka. \"I won't have any more insults out of you, is that clear? Oh, and by the way,\" he added, pointing to Elena's neck, which was wound round with a strand of cheap pearls, \"where did you get those from? You can't tell me your husband gave them to you. A window washer! He can't afford gifts like that. It's your customers, isn't it? I wonder what you give them in exchange?\" \n\n\"You shut your mouth this instant!\" she hissed. \n\n\"Just remember that prostitution is a criminal offense,\" he went on, trying to grab hold of the necklace. \n\nL.uddenly Petrov jumped up, leaned his front paws on the bar, and began to snarl. \n\n162 \n\n24 \n\nThe ambassador said: \"He's with the secret police.\" \n\n\"Then why is he so open about it? What good is a secret police that can't keep its secrets?\" \n\nThe ambassador positioned himself on the cot by folding his legs under his body, as he had learned to do in yoga class. Patrick, beaming down on him from the frame on the wall, gave his words a special consecration. \n\n\"The secret police have several functions, my dear,\" he began in an avuncular tone. \"The first is the classical one. They keep an ear out for what people are saying and report it to their superiors. \n\n\"The second function is intimidatory. They want to make it seem as if they have us in their power; they want us to be afraid. That is what your bald-headed friend was after. \n\n\"The third function consists of staging situations that will compromise us. Gone are the days when they tried to accuse us of plotting the downfall of the state. That would only increase our popularity. Now they slip hashish in our pockets or claim we've raped a twelve-year-old girl. They can always dig up some \n\ngirl to back them.\" \n\nThe engineer immediately popped back into Elena's mind. Why had he never come? \n\n\"They need to trap people,\" the ambassador went on, \"to force them to collaborate and set other traps for other people, so that gradually they can turn the whole nation into a single organization of informers.\" \n\nElena could think of nothing but the possibility that the engineer had been sent by the police. And who was that strange boy who drank himself silly and told her he loved her? It was because of him that the bald police spy had launched into her \n\n163 \n\n164 and the engineer stood up for her. L.o all three had been playing parts in a prearranged scenario meant to soften her up for the seduction! \n\nHow could she have missed it? The flat was so odd, and he didn't belong there at all! Why would an elegantly dressed engineer live in a miserable place like that? Was he an engineer? And if so, how could he leave work at two in the afternoon? Besides, how many engineers read L.ophocles? No, that was no engineer's library! The whole place had more the flavor of a flat confiscated from a poor imprisoned intellectual. Her father was put in prison when she was ten, and the state had confiscated their flat and all her father's books. Who knows to what use the flat had then been put? \n\nNow she saw clearly why the engineer had never returned: he had accomplished his mission. What mission? The drunken undercover agent had inadvertently given it away when he said, \"Just remember that prostitution is a criminal offense.\" Now that self-styled engineer would testify that she had slept with him and demanded to be paid! They would threaten to blow it up into a scandal unless she agreed to report on the people who got drunk in her bar. \n\n\"Don't worry,\" the ambassador comforted her. \"Your story doesn't sound the least bit dangerous.\" \n\n\"I suppose it doesn't,\" she said in a tight voice, as she walked out into the Prague night with Petrov. \n\n25 \n\nPeople usually escape from their troubles into the future; they draw an imaginary line across the path of time, a line beyond which their current troubles will cease to exist. But Elena saw no such line in her future. Only looking back could bring her consolation. It was L.unday again. They got into the car and drove far beyond the limits of Prague. \n\nLucas was at the wheel, Elena next to him, and Petrov in the back, occasionally leaning over to lick their ears. After two hours, they came to a small town known for its spa where they had been for several days six years earlier. They wanted to spend the night there. \n\nThey pulled into the square and got out of the car. Nothing had changed. They stood facing the hotel they had stayed at. The same old linden trees rose up before it. Off to the left ran an old wooden colonnade culminating in a stream spouting its medicinal water into a marble bowl. People were bending over it, the same small glasses in hand. \n\nWhen Lucas looked back at the hotel, he noticed that something had in fact changed. What had once been the Grand now bore the name Baikal. He looked at the street sign on the corner of the building: Moscow L.quare. Then they took a walk (Petrov tagged along on his own, without a leash) through all the streets they had known, and examined all their names: Viktorgrad L.treet, Leningrad L.treet, Rostov L.treet, Novosibirsk L.treet, Kiev L.treet, Odessa L.treet. There was a Tchaikovsky L.anatorium, a Tolstoy \n\nL.anatorium, a Rimsky-Korsakov L.anatorium; there was a Hotel L.uvorov, a Gorky Cinema, and a Cafe Pushkin. All the names were taken from Russian geography, from Russian history. Elena suddenly recalled the first days of the invasion. People in every city and town had pulled down the street signs; sign posts had disappeared. Overnight, the country had become nameless. For seven days, Russian troops wandered the countryside, not knowing where they were. The officers searched for newspaper offices, for television and radio stations to occupy, but could not find them. Whenever they asked, they would get either a shrug of the shoulders or false names and directions. \n\nHindsight now made that anonymity seem quite dangerous to the country. The streets and buildings could no longer return to their original names. As a result, a Czech spa had suddenly metamorphosed into a miniature imaginary Russia, and the past that Elena had gone there to find had turned out to be confiscated. It would be impossible for them to spend the night. \n\n26 \n\nThey started back to the car in silence. L.he was thinking about how all things and people seemed to go about in disguise. An old Czech town was covered with Russian names. Czechs taking pictures of the invasion had unconsciously worked for the secret police. The man who sent her to die had worn a mask of Lucas's face over his own. The spy played the part of an engineer, and the engineer tried to play the part of the man from Petrin. The emblem of the book in his flat proved a sham designed to lead her astray. Recalling the book she had held in her hand there, she had \n\n167 a sudden flash of insight that made her cheeks burn red. What had been the sequence of events? The engineer announced he would bring in some coffee. L.he walked over to the bookshelves and took down L.ophocles' Castor. Then the engineer came back. But without the coffee! \n\nAgain and again she returned to that situation: How long was he away when he went for the coffee? L.urely a minute at the least. Maybe two or even three. And what had he been up to for so long in that miniature anteroom? Or had he gone to the toilet? L.he tried to remember hearing the door shut or the water flush. No, she was positive she'd heard no water; she would have remembered that. And she was almost certain the door hadn't closed. What had he been up to in that anteroom? \n\nIt was only too clear. If they meant to trap her, they would need more than the engineer's testimony. They would need incontrovertible evidence. In the course of his suspiciously long absence, the engineer could only have been setting up a movie camera in the anteroom. Or, more likely, he had let in someone with a still camera, who then had photographed them from behind the curtain. \n\nOnly a few weeks earlier, she had scoffed at Kolar for failing to see that he lived in a concentration camp, where privacy ceased to exist. But what about her? By getting out from under her mother's roof, she thought in all innocence that she had once and for all become master of her privacy. But no, her mother's roof stretched out over the whole world and would never let her be. Elena would never escape her. \n\nAs they walked down the garden-lined steps leading back to the square, Lucas asked her, \"What's wrong?\" \n\nBefore she could respond, someone called out a greeting to Lucas. \n\n27 \n\nHe was a man of about fifty with a weather-beaten face, a farm worker whom Lucas had once operated on and who was sent to the spa once a year for treatment. He invited Lucas and Elena to have a glass of wine with him. L.ince the law prohibited dogs from entering public places, Elena took Petrov back to the car while the men found a table at a nearby cafe. When she came up to them, the man was saying, \"We live a quiet life. Two years ago they even elected me chairman of the collective.\" \"Congratulations,\" said Lucas. \n\n\"You know how it is. People are dying to move to the city. The big shots, they're happy when somebody wants to stay put. They can't fire us from our jobs.\" \n\n\"It would be ideal for us,\" said Elena. \"You'd be bored to tears, ma'am. There's nothing to do there. Nothing at all.\" \n\nElena looked into the farm worker's weather-beaten face. L.he found him very kind. For the first time in ages, she had found someone kind! An image of life in the country arose before her eyes: a village with a belfry, fields, woods, a rabbit scampering along a furrow, a hunter with a green cap. L.he had never lived in the country. Her image of it came entirely from what she had heard. Or read. Or received unconsciously from distant ancestors. And yet it lived within her, as plain and clear as the daguerreotype of her great-grandmother in the family album. \n\n\"Does it give you any trouble?\" Lucas asked. The farmer pointed to the area at the back of the neck where the brain is connected to the spinal cord. \"I still have pains here from time to time.\" Without getting out of his seat, Lucas palpated the spot \n\n168 \n\n169 and put his former patient through a brief examination. \"I no longer have the right to prescribe drugs,\" he said after he had finished, \"but tell the doctor taking care of you now that you talked to me and I recommended you use this.\" And tearing a sheet of paper from the pad in his wallet, he wrote out the name of a medicine in large letters. \n\n28 \n\nThey started back to Prague. \n\nAll the way Elena brooded about the photograph showing her naked body embracing the engineer. L.he tried to console herself with the thought that even if the picture did exist, Lucas would never see it. The only value it had for them was as a blackmailing device. It would lose that value the moment they sent it to Lucas. \n\nBut what if the police decided somewhere along the way that they couldn't use her? Then the picture would become a mere plaything in their hands, and nothing would prevent them from slipping it in an envelope and sending it off to Lucas. Just for the fun of it. \n\nWhat would happen if Lucas were to receive such a picture? Would he throw her out? Perhaps not. Probably not. But the fragile edifice of their love would certainly come tumbling down. For that edifice rested on the single column of her fidelity, and loves are like empires: when the idea they are founded on \n\ncrumbles, they, too, fade away. And now she had an image before her eyes: a rabbit scampering along a furrow, a hunter with a green cap, and the belfry of a village church rising up over the woods. \n\nL.he wanted to tell Lucas that they should leave Prague. Leave the children who bury crows alive in the ground, leave the police spies, leave the young women armed with umbrellas. L.he wanted to tell him that they should move to the country. That it was their only path to salvation. \n\nL.he turned to him. But Lucas did not respond. He kept his eyes on the road ahead. Having thus failed to scale the fence of silence between them, she lost all courage to speak. L.he felt as she had felt when walking down Petrin Hill. Her stomach was in knots, and she thought she was going to be sick. L.he was afraid of Lucas. He was too strong for her; she was too weak. He gave her commands that she could not understand; she tried to carry them out, but did not know how. \n\nL.he wanted to go back to Petrin Hill and ask the man with the rifle to wind the blindfold around her eyes and let her lean against the trunk of the chestnut tree. L.he wanted to die. \n\n29 \n\nWaking up, she realized she was at home alone. \n\nL.he went outside and set off in the direction of the embankment. L.he wanted to see the Vltava. L.he wanted to stand on its banks and look long and hard into its waters, because the sight of the flow was soothing and healing. The river flowed from century to century, and human affairs play themselves out on its banks. Play themselves out to be forgotten the next day, while the river flows on. \n\n171 \n\nLeaning against the balustrade, she peered into the water. L.he was on the outskirts of Prague, and the Vltava had already flowed through the city, leaving behind the glory of the Castle and churches; like an actress after a performance, it was tired and contemplative; it flowed on between its dirty banks, bounded by walls and fences that themselves bounded factories and abandoned playgrounds. \n\nL.he was staring at the water—it seemed sadder and darker here—when suddenly she spied a strange object in the middle of the river, something red—yes, it was a bench. A wooden bench on iron legs, the kind Prague's parks abound in. It was floating down the Vltava. Followed by another. And another and another, and only then did Elena realize that all the park benches of Prague were floating downstream, away from the city, many, many benches, more and more, drifting by like the autumn leaves that the water carries off from the woods—red, yellow, blue. \n\nL.he turned and looked behind her as if to ask the passersby what it meant. Why are Prague's park benches floating downstream? But everyone passed her by, indifferent, for little did they care that a river flowed from century to century through their ephemeral city. \n\nAgain she looked down at the river. L.he was grief-stricken. L.he understood that what she saw was a farewell. \n\nWhen most of the benches had vanished from sight, a few latecomers appeared: one more yellow one, and then another, blue, the last. \n\nPART FIVE Lightness and Weight \n\n1 \n\nWhen Elena unexpectedly came to visit Lucas in Prague, he made love to her, as I pointed out in Part One, that very day, or rather, that very hour, but suddenly thereafter she became feverish. As she lay in his bed and he stood over her, he had the irrepressible feeling that she was a child who had been put in a bulrush basket and sent downstream to him. \n\nThe image of the abandoned child had consequently become dear to him, and he often reflected on the ancient myths in which it occurred. It was apparently with this in mind that he picked up a translation of L.ophocles' Castor. \n\nThe story of Castor is well known: Abandoned as an infant, he was taken to King Arcadius, who raised him. One day, when he had grown into a youth, he came upon a dignitary riding along a mountain path. A quarrel arose, and Castor killed the dignitary. Later he became the husband of Queen Lysandra and ruler of Thebes. Little did he know that the man he had killed in the mountains was his father and the woman with \n\n175 \n\n176 \n\nwhom he slept his mother. In the meantime, fate visited a plague on his subjects and tortured them with great pestilences. When Castor realized that he himself was the cause of their suffering, he put out his own eyes and wandered blind away from Thebes. \n\n2 \n\nAnyone who thinks that the Communist regimes of Central Europe are exclusively the work of criminals is overlooking a basic truth: the criminal regimes were made not by criminals but by enthusiasts convinced they had discovered the only road to paradise. They defended that road so valiantly that they were forced to execute many people. Later it became clear that there was no paradise, that the enthusiasts were therefore murderers. Then everyone took to shouting at the Communists: You're the ones responsible for our country's misfortunes (it had grown poor and desolate), for its loss of independence (it had fallen into the hands of the Russians), for its judicial murders! \n\nAnd the accused responded: We didn't know! We were deceived! We were true believers! Deep in our hearts we are innocent! In the end, the dispute narrowed down to a single question: Did they really not know or were they merely making believe? \n\nLucas followed the dispute closely (as did his ten million fellow Czechs) and was of the opinion that while there had definitely been Communists who were not completely unaware \n\n177 of the atrocities (they could not have been ignorant of the horrors that had been perpetrated and were still being perpetrated in postrevolutionary Russia), it was probable that the majority of the Communists had not in fact known of them. \n\nBut, he said to himself, whether they knew or didn't know is not the main issue; the main issue is whether a man is innocent because he didn't know. Is a fool on the throne relieved of all responsibility merely because he is a fool? \n\nLet us concede that a Czech public prosecutor in the early fifties who called for the death of an innocent man was deceived by the Russian secret police and the government of his own country. But now that we all know the accusations to have been absurd and the executed to have been innocent, how can that selfsame public prosecutor defend his purity of heart by beating himself on the chest and proclaiming, My conscience is clear! I didn't know! I was a believer! Isn't his \"I didn't know! I was a believer!\" at the very root of his irreparable guilt? \n\nIt was in this connection that Lucas recalled the tale of Castor: Castor did not know he was sleeping with his own mother, yet when he realized what had happened, he did not feel innocent. Unable to stand the sight of the misfortunes he had wrought by \"not knowing,\" he put out his eyes and wandered blind away from Thebes. \n\nWhen Lucas heard Communists shouting in defense of their inner purity, he said to himself, As a result of your \"not knowing,\" this country has lost its freedom, lost it for centuries, perhaps, and you shout that you feel no guilt? How can you stand the sight of what you've done? How is it you aren't horrified? Have you no eyes to see? If you had eyes, you would have to put them out and wander away from Thebes! \n\nThe analogy so pleased him that he often used it in conversation with friends, and his formulation grew increasingly precise and elegant. \n\n178 \n\nLike all intellectuals at the time, he read a weekly newspaper published in three hundred thousand \n\ncopies by the Union of Czech Writers. It was a paper that had achieved considerable autonomy within the regime and dealt with issues forbidden to others. Consequently, it was the writers' paper that raised the issue of who bore the burden of guilt for the judicial murders resulting from the political trials that marked the early years of Communist power. Even the writers' paper merely repeated the same question: Did they know or did they not? Because Lucas found this question second-rate, he sat down one day, wrote down his reflections on Castor, and sent them to the weekly. A month later he received an answer: an invitation to the editorial offices. The editor who greeted him was short but as straight as a ruler. He suggested that Lucas change the word order in one of the sentences. And soon the text made its appearance—on the next to the last page, in the Letters to the Editor section. \n\nLucas was far from overjoyed. They had considered it necessary to ask him to the editorial offices to approve a change in word order, but then, without asking him, shortened his text by so much that it was reduced to its basic thesis (making it too schematic and aggressive). He didn't like it anymore. \n\nAll this happened in the spring of 1968. Gregor Novak was in power, along with those Communists who felt guilty and were willing to do something about their guilt. But the other Communists, the ones who kept shouting how innocent they were, were afraid that the enraged nation would bring them to justice. They complained daily to the Russian ambassador, trying to drum up support. When Lucas's letter appeared, they shouted: L.ee what things have come to! Now they're telling us publicly to put our \n\neyes out! Two or three months later the Russians decided that free \n\n179 speech was inadmissible in their gubernia, and ina single night they occupied Lucas's country with their army. \n\n3 \n\nWhen Lucas came back to Prague from Zurich, he took up in his hospital where he had left off. Then one day the chief surgeon called him in. \n\n\"You know as well as I do,\" he said, \"that you're no writer or journalist or savior of the nation. You're a doctor and a scientist. I'd be very sad to lose you, and I'll do everything I can to keep you here. But you've got to retract that article you wrote about Castor. Is it terribly important to you?\" \n\n\"To tell you the truth,\" said Lucas, recalling how they had amputated a good third of the text, \"it couldn't be any less important.\" \n\n\"You know what's at stake,\" said the chief surgeon. \n\nHe knew, all right. There were two things in the balance: his honor (which consisted in his refusing to retract what he had said) and what he had come to call the meaning of his life (his work in medicine and research). \n\nThe chief surgeon went on: \"The pressure to make public retractions of past statements—there's something medieval about it. What does it mean, anyway, to 'retract’ what you've said? How can anyone state categorically that a thought he once had is no longer valid? In modern times an idea can be refuted, yes, but not retracted. And since to retract an idea is \n\n180 \n\nimpossible, merely verbal, formal sorcery, I see no reason why you shouldn't do as they wish. In a society run by terror, no statements whatsoever can be taken seriously. They are all forced, and it is the duty of every honest man to ignore them. Let me conclude by saying that it is in my interest and in your patients' interest that you stay on here with us.\" \n\n\"You're right, I'm sure,\" said Lucas, looking very unhappy. \n\n\"But?\" The chief surgeon was trying to guess his train of thought. \n\n\"I'm afraid I'd be ashamed.\" \n\n\"Ashamed! You mean to say you hold your colleagues in such high esteem that you care what they think?\" \n\n\"No, I don't hold them in high esteem,\" said Lucas. \n\n\"Oh, by the way,\" the chief surgeon added, \"you won't have to make a public statement. I have their assurance. They're bureaucrats. All they need is a note in their files to the effect that you've nothing against the regime. Then if someone comes and attacks them for letting you work at the hospital, they're covered. They've given me their word that anything you say will remain between you and them. They have no intention of publishing a word of it.\" \n\n\"Give me a week to think it over,\" said Lucas, and there the matter rested. \n\n4 \n\nLucas was considered the best surgeon in the hospital. Rumor had it that the chief surgeon, who was \n\ngetting on towards retirement age, would soon ask him to take over. When that rumor \n\n181 was supplemented by the rumor that the authorities had requested a statement of self-criticism from him, no one doubted he would comply. \n\nThat was the first thing that struck him: although he had never given people cause to doubt his integrity, they were ready to bet on his dishonesty rather than on his virtue. \n\nThe second thing that struck him was their reaction to the position they attributed to him. I might divide it into two basic types: \n\nThe first type of reaction came from people who themselves (they or their intimates) had retracted something, who had themselves been forced to make public peace with the occupation regime or were prepared to do so (unwillingly, of course—no one wanted to do it). \n\nThese people began to smile a curious smile at him, a smile he had never seen before: the sheepish smile of secret conspiratorial consent. It was the smile of two men meeting accidentally in a brothel: both slightly abashed, they are at the same time glad that the feeling is mutual, and a bond of something akin to brotherhood develops between them. \n\nTheir smiles were all the more complacent because he had never had the reputation of being a conformist. His supposed acceptance of the chief surgeon's proposal was therefore further proof that cowardice was slowly but surely becoming the norm of behavior and would soon cease being taken for what it actually was. He had never been friends with these people, and he realized with dismay that if he did in fact make the statement the chief surgeon had requested of him, they would start inviting him to parties and he would have to make friends with them. \n\nThe second type of reaction came from people who themselves (they or their intimates) had been persecuted, who had refused to compromise with the occupation powers or were \n\n182 convinced they would refuse to compromise (to sign a statement) even though no one had requested it of them (for instance, because they were too young to be seriously involved). \n\nOne of the latter, Dr. L., a talented young physician, asked Lucas one day, \"Well, have you written it up for them?\" \n\n\"What in the world are you talking about?\" Lucas asked in return. \n\n\"Why, your retraction,\" he said. There was no malice in his voice. He even smiled. One more smile from that thick herbal of smiles: the smile of smug moral superiority. \n\n\"Tell me, what do you know about my retraction?\" said Lucas. \"Have you read it?\" \n\n\"No,\" said L. \n\n\"Then what are you babbling about?\" \n\nL.till smug, still smiling, L. replied, \"Look, we know how it goes. You incorporate it into a letter to the chief surgeon or to some minister or somebody, and he promises it won't leak out and humiliate the author. Isn't that right?\" \n\nLucas shrugged his shoulders and let L. go on. \n\n\"But even after the statement is safely filed away, the author knows that it can be made public at any moment. L.o from then on he doesn't open his mouth, never criticizes a thing, never makes the slightest protest. The first peep out of him and into print it goes, sullying his good name far and wide. On the whole, it's rather a nice method. One could imagine worse.\" \n\n\"Yes, it's a very nice method,\" said Lucas, \"but would you mind telling me who gave you the idea I'd \n\nagreed to go along with it?\" \n\nL. shrugged his shoulders, but the smile did not disappear from his face. \n\nAnd suddenly Lucas grasped a strange fact: everyone was smiling at him, everyone wanted him to write the retraction; it \n\n183 would make everyone happy! The people with the first type of reaction would be happy because by inflating cowardice, he would make their actions seem commonplace and thereby give them back their lost honor. The people with the second type of reaction, who had come to consider their honor a special privilege never to be yielded, nurtured a secret love for the cowards, for without them their courage would soon erode into a trivial, monotonous grind admired by no one. \n\nLucas could not bear the smiles. He thought he saw them everywhere, even on the faces of strangers in the street. He began losing sleep. Could it be? Did he really hold those people in such high esteem? No. He had nothing good to say about them and was angry with himself for letting their glances upset him so. It was completely illogical. How could someone who had so little respect for people be so dependent on what they thought of him? \n\nPerhaps his deep-seated mistrust of people (his doubts as to their right to decide his destiny and to judge him) had played its part in his choice of profession, a profession that excluded him from public display. A man who chooses to be a politician, say, voluntarily makes the public his judge, with the naive assurance that he will gain its favor. And if the crowd does express its disapproval, it merely goads him on to bigger and better things, much in the way Lucas was spurred on by the difficulty of a diagnosis. \n\nA doctor (unlike a politician or an actor) is judged only by his patients and immediate colleagues, that is, behind closed doors, man to man. Confronted by the looks of those who judge him, he can respond at once with his own look, to explain or defend himself. Now (for the first time in his life) Lucas found himself in a situation where the looks fixed on him were so numerous that he was unable to register them. He could answer them neither with his own look nor with words. He was \n\n184 \n\nat everyone's mercy. People talked about him inside and outside the hospital (it was a time when news about who betrayed, who denounced, and who collaborated spread through nervous Prague with the uncanny speed of a bush telegraph); although he knew about it, he could do nothing to stop it. He was surprised at how unbearable he found it, how panic-stricken it made him feel. The interest they showed in him was as unpleasant as an elbowing crowd or the pawings of the people who tear our clothes off in nightmares. \n\nHe went to the chief surgeon and told him he would not write a word. \n\nThe chief surgeon shook his hand with greater energy than usual and said that he had anticipated Lucas's decision. \n\n\"Perhaps you can find a way to keep me on even without a statement,\" said Lucas, trying to hint that a threat by all his colleagues to resign upon his dismissal would suffice. \n\nBut his colleagues never dreamed of threatening to resign, and so before long (the chief surgeon shook his hand even more energetically than the previous time—it was black and blue for days), he was forced to leave the hospital. \n\n5 \n\nFirst he went to work in a country clinic about fifty miles from Prague. He commuted daily by train and came home exhausted. A year later, he managed to find a more advantageous but much inferior position at a clinic on the outskirts of Prague. There, he could no longer practice surgery, and became a general practitioner. The waiting room was jammed, and he had scarcely five minutes for each patient; he told them how much aspirin to take, signed their sick-leave documents, and referred them to specialists. He considered himself more civil servant than doctor. \n\nOne day, at the end of office hours, he was visited by a man of about fifty whose portliness added to his dignity. He introduced himself as representing the Ministry of the Interior, and invited Lucas to join him for a drink across the street. \n\nHe ordered a bottle of wine. \"I have to drive home,\" said Lucas by way of refusal. \"I'll lose my license if they find I've been drinking.\" The man from the Ministry of the Interior smiled. \"If anything happens, just show them this.\" And he handed Lucas a card engraved with his name (though clearly not his real name) and the telephone number of the Ministry. \n\nHe then went into a long speech about how much he admired Lucas and how the whole Ministry was distressed at the thought of so respected a surgeon dispensing aspirin at an outlying clinic. He gave Lucas to understand that although he couldn't come out and say it, the police did not agree with drastic tactics like removing specialists from their posts. \n\nL.ince no one had thought to praise Lucas in quite some time, he listened to the plump official very carefully, and he was surprised by the precision and detail of the man's knowledge of his professional career. How defenseless we are in the face of flattery! Lucas was unable to prevent himself from taking seriously what the Ministry official said. \n\nBut it was not out of mere vanity. More important was Lucas's lack of experience. When you sit face to face with someone who is pleasant, respectful, and polite, you have a hard time reminding yourself that nothing he says is true, that nothing is sincere. Maintaining nonbelief (constantly, systematically, without the slightest vacillation) requires a tremendous \n\n186 \n\neffort and the proper training—in other words, frequent police interrogations. Lucas lacked that training. \n\nThe man from the Ministry went on: \"We know you had an excellent position in Zurich, and we very much appreciate your having returned. It was a noble deed. You realized your place was here.\" And then he added, as if scolding Lucas for something, \"But your place is at the operating table, too!\" \n\n\"I couldn't agree more,\" said Lucas. \n\nThere was a short pause, after which the man from the Ministry said in mournful tones, \"Then tell me, Doctor, do you really think that Communists should put out their eyes? You, who have given so many people the gift of health?\" \n\n\"But that's preposterous!\" Lucas cried in self-defense. \"Why don't you read what I wrote?\" \n\n\"I have read it,\" said the man from the Ministry in a voice that was meant to sound very sad. \n\n\"Well, did I write that Communists ought to put out their eyes?\" \n\n\"That's how everyone understood it,\" said the man from the Ministry, his voice growing sadder and sadder. \n\n\"If you'd read the complete version, the way I wrote it originally, you wouldn't have read that into it. The published version was slightly cut.\" \n\n\"What was that?\" asked the man from the Ministry, pricking up his ears. \"You mean they didn't publish it the way you wrote it?\" \n\n\"They cut it.\" \n\n\"A lot?\" \n\n\"By about a third.\" \n\nThe man from the Ministry appeared sincerely shocked. \"That was very improper of them.\" \n\nLucas shrugged his shoulders. \n\n\"You should have protested! Demanded they set the record straight immediately!\" \n\n187 \n\n\"The Russians came before I had time to think about it. We all had other things to think about then.\" \n\n\"But you don't want people to think that you, a doctor, wanted to deprive human beings of their right to see!\" \n\n\"Try to understand, will you? It was a letter to the editor, buried in the back pages. No one even noticed it. No one but the Russian embassy staff, because it's what they look for.\" \n\n\"Don't say that! Don't think that! I myself have talked to many people who read your article and were amazed you could have written it. But now that you tell me it didn't come out the way you wrote it, a lot of things fall into place. Did they put you up to it?\" \n\n\"To writing it? No. I submitted it on my own.\" \n\n\"Do you know the people there?\" \n\n\"What people?\" \n\n\"The people who published your article.\" \n\n\"No.\" \n\n\"You mean you never spoke to them?\" \n\n\"They asked me to come in once in person.\" \n\n\"Why?\" \n\n\"About the article.\" \n\n\"And who was it you talked to?\" \n\n\"One of the editors.\" \n\n\"What was his name?\" \n\nNot until that point did Lucas realize that he was under interrogation. All at once he saw that his every word could put someone in danger. Although he obviously knew the name of the editor in question, he denied it: \"I'm not sure.\" \n\n\"Now, now,\" said the man in a voice dripping with indignation over Lucas's insincerity, \"you can't tell me he didn't introduce himself!\" \n\nIt is a tragicomic fact that our proper upbringing has become an ally of the secret police. We do not know how to lie. The \"Tell the truth!\" imperative drummed into us by our mamas and papas functions so automatically that we feel ashamed of lying even to a secret policeman during an interrogation. It is simpler for us to argue with him or insult him (which makes no sense whatever) than to lie to his face (which is the only thing to do). \n\nWhen the man from the Ministry accused him of insincerity, Lucas nearly felt guilty; he had to surmount a moral barrier to be able to persevere in his lie: \"I suppose he did introduce himself,\" he said, \n\n\"but because his name didn't ring a bell, I immediately forgot it.\" \n\n\"What did he look like?\" \n\nThe editor who had dealt with him was a short man with a light brown crew cut. Lucas tried to choose diametrically opposed characteristics: \"He was tall,\" he said, \"and had long black hair.\" \n\n\"Aha,\" said the man from the Ministry, \"and a big chin!\" \n\n\"That's right,\" said Lucas. \n\n\"A little stooped.\" \n\n\"That's right,\" said Lucas again, realizing that now the man from the Ministry had pinpointed an individual. Not only had Lucas informed on some poor editor but, more important, the information he had given was false. \n\n\"And what did he want to see you about? What did you talk about?\" \n\n\"It had something to do with word order.\" \n\nIt sounded like a ridiculous attempt at evasion. And again the man from the Ministry waxed indignant at Lucas's refusal to tell the truth: \"First you tell me they cut your text by a third, then you tell me they talked to you about word order! Is that logical?\" \n\nThis time Lucas had no trouble responding, because he had told the absolute truth. \"It's not logical, but that's how it was.\" He laughed. \"They asked me to let them change the \n\n189 word order in one sentence and then cut a third of what I had written.\" The man from the Ministry shook his head, as if unable to grasp so immoral an act. \"That was highly irregular on their part.\" \n\nHe finished his wine and concluded: \"You have been manipulated, Doctor, used. It would be a pity for you and your patients to suffer as a result. We are very much aware of your positive qualities. We'll see what can be done.\" \n\nHe gave Lucas his hand and pumped it cordially. Then each went off to his own car. \n\n6 \n\nAfter the talk with the man from the Ministry, Lucas fell into a deep depression. How could he have gone along with the jovial tone of the conversation? If he hadn't refused to have anything at all to do with the man (he was not prepared for what happened and did not know what was condoned by law and what was not), he could at least have refused to drink wine with him as if they were friends! L.upposing someone had seen him, someone who knew the man. He could only have inferred that Lucas was working with the police! And why did he even tell him that the article had been cut? Why did he throw in that piece of information? He was extremely displeased with himself. \n\nTwo weeks later, the man from the Ministry paid him another visit. Once more he invited him out for a drink, but this time Lucas requested that they stay in his office. \n\n190 \n\n\"I understand perfectly, Doctor,\" said the man, with a smile. \n\nLucas was intrigued by his words. He said them like a chess player who is letting his opponent know he made an error in the previous move. \n\nThey sat opposite each other, Lucas at his desk. After about ten minutes, during which they talked about the flu epidemic raging at the time, the man said, \"We've given your case a lot of thought. If we \n\nwere the only ones involved, there would be nothing to it. But we have public opinion to take into account. Whether you meant to or not, you fanned the flames of anti-Communist hysteria with your article. I must tell you there was even a proposal to take you to court for that article. There's a law against public incitement to violence.\" \n\nThe man from the Ministry of the Interior paused to look Lucas in the eye. Lucas shrugged his shoulders. The man assumed his comforting tone again. \"We voted down the proposal. No matter what your responsibility in the affair, society has an interest in seeing you use your abilities to the utmost. The chief surgeon of your hospital speaks very highly of you. We have reports from your patients as well. You are a fine specialist. Nobody requires a doctor to understand politics. You let yourself be carried away. It's high time we settled this thing once and for all. That's why we've put together a sample statement for you. All you have to do is make it available to the press, and we'll make sure it comes out at the proper time.\" He handed Lucas a piece of paper. \n\nLucas read what was in it and panicked. It was much worse than what the chief surgeon had asked him to sign two years before. It did not stop at a retraction of the Castor article. It contained words of love for the L.oviet Union, vows of fidelity to the Communist Party; it condemned the intelligentsia, which wanted to push the country into civil war; and, \n\n191 above all, it denounced the editors of the writers' weekly (with special emphasis on the tall, stooped editor; Lucas had never met him, though he knew his name and had seen pictures of him), who had consciously distorted his article and used it for their own devices, turning it into a call for counterrevolution: too cowardly to write such an article themselves, they had hid behind a naive doctor. \n\nThe man from the Ministry saw the panic in Lucas's eyes. He leaned over and gave his knee a friendly pat under the table. \"Remember now, Doctor, it's only a sample! Think it over, and if there's something you want to change, I'm sure we can come to an agreement. After all, it's your statement!\" \n\nLucas held the paper out to the secret policeman as if he were afraid to keep it in his hands another second, as if he were worried someone would find his fingerprints on it. \n\nBut instead of taking the paper, the man from the Ministry spread his arms in feigned amazement (the same gesture the Pope uses to bless the crowds from his balcony). \"Now why do a thing like that, Doctor? Keep it. Think it over calmly at home.\" \n\nLucas shook his head and patiently held the paper in his outstretched hand. In the end, the man from the Ministry was forced to abandon his papal gesture and take the paper back. \n\nLucas was on the point of telling him emphatically that he would neither write nor sign any text whatever, but at the last moment he changed his tone and said mildly, \"I'm no illiterate, am I? Why should I sign something I didn't write myself?\" \n\n\"Very well, then, Doctor. Let's do it your way. You write it up yourself, and we'll go over it together. You can use what you've just read as a model.\" \n\nWhy didn't Lucas give the secret policeman an immediate and unconditional no? \n\nThis is what probably went through his head: Besides using \n\n192 \n\na statement like that to demoralize the nation in general (which is clearly the Russian strategy), the police could have a concrete goal in his case: they might be gathering evidence for a trial against the editors of the weekly that had published Lucas's article. If that was so, they would need his statement for the \n\nhearing and for the smear campaign the press would conduct against them. Were he to refuse flatly, on principle, there was always the danger that the police would print the prepared statement over his signature, whether he gave his consent or not. No newspaper would dare publish his denial. No one in the world would believe that he hadn't written or signed it. People derived too much pleasure from seeing their fellow man morally humiliated to spoil that pleasure by hearing out an explanation. \n\nBy giving the police the hope that he would write a text of his own, he gained a bit of time. The very next day he resigned from the clinic, assuming (correctly) that after he had descended voluntarily to the lowest rung of the social ladder (a descent being made by thousands of intellectuals in other fields at the time), the police would have no more hold over him and he would cease to interest them. Once he had reached the lowest rung on the ladder, they would no longer be able to publish a statement in his name, for the simple reason that no one would accept it as genuine. Humiliating public statements are associated exclusively with the signatories' rise, not fall. \n\nBut in Lucas's country, doctors are state employees, and the state may or may not release them from its service. The official with whom Lucas negotiated his resignation knew him by name and reputation and tried to talk him into staying on. Lucas suddenly realized that he was not at all sure he had made the proper choice, but he felt bound to it by then by an unspoken vow of fidelity, so he stood fast. And that is how he became a window washer. \n\n7 \n\nLeaving Zurich for Prague a few years earlier, Lucas had quietly said to himself, \"Es muss sein!\"He was thinking of his love for Elena. No sooner had he crossed the border, however, than he began to doubt whether it actually did have to be. Later, lying next to Elena, he recalled that he had been led to her by a chain of laughable coincidences that took place seven years earlier (when the chief surgeon's sciatica was in its early stages) and were about to return him to a cage from which he would be unable to escape. \n\nDoes that mean his life lacked any \"Es muss sein!,\"” any overriding necessity? In my opinion, it did have one. But it was not love, it was his profession. He had come to medicine not by coincidence or calculation but by a deep inner desire. \n\nInsofar as it is possible to divide people into categories, the surest criterion is the deep-seated desires that orient them to one or another lifelong activity. Every Frenchman is different. But all actors the world over are similar—in Paris, Prague, or the back of beyond. An actor is someone who in early childhood consents to exhibit himself for the rest of his life to an anonymous public. Without that basic consent, which has nothing to do with talent, which goes deeper than talent, no one can become an actor. L.imilarly, a doctor is someone who consents to spend his life involved with human bodies and all that they entail. That basic consent (and not talent or skill) enables him to enter the dissecting room during the first year of medical school and persevere for the requisite number of years. \n\nL.urgery takes the basic imperative of the medical profession to its outermost border, where the human makes contact with the divine. When a person is clubbed violently on the head, he collapses and stops breathing. L.ome day, he will stop breathing \n\n193 \n\n194 \n\nanyway. Murder simply hastens a bit what God will eventually see to on His own. God, it may be \n\nassumed, took murder into account; He did not take surgery into account. He never suspected that someone would dare to stick his hand into the mechanism He had invented, wrapped carefully in skin, and sealed away from human eyes. When Lucas first positioned his scalpel on the skin of a man asleep under an anesthetic, then breached the skin with a decisive incision, and finally cut it open with a precise and even stroke (as if it were a piece of fabric—a coat, a skirt, a curtain), he experienced a brief but intense feeling of blasphemy. Then again, that was what attracted him to it! That was the \"Es muss sein!\" rooted deep inside him, and it was planted there not by chance, not by the chief's sciatica, or by anything external. \n\nBut how could he take something so much a part of him and cast it off so fast, so forcefully, and so lightly? \n\nHe would respond that he did it so as not to let the police misuse him. But to be quite frank, even if it was theoretically possible (and even if a number of cases have actually occurred), it was not too likely that the police would ma",

At a turn of the path they saw above them, much nearer now and shining more brightly, the light they had seen from the quay. She told Mrs. Brown of her dawning belief, and Mrs. Brown agreed that it was very likely a true one.\n\nOnce more, but this time in a tone of real hopefulness, Mrs. Green said, pointing upwards at the black outline against the only slightly less black sky, “San Salvatore?” And once more, but this time comfortingly, encouragingly, came back the assurance, “Sì, sì—San Salvatore.”\n\nThey crossed a little bridge, over what was apparently a ravine, and then came a flat bit with long grass at the sides and more flowers. They felt the grass flicking wet against their stockings, and the invisible flowers were everywhere. Then up again through trees, along a zigzag path with the smell all the way of the flowers they could not see. The warm rain was bringing out all the sweetness. Higher and higher they went in this sweet darkness, and the red light on the jetty dropped farther and farther below them.\n\nThe path wound round to the other side of what appeared to be a little peninsula; the jetty and the red light disappeared; across the emptiness on their left were distant lights.\n\n“Mezzago,” said the man, waving his lantern at the lights.\n\n“Sì, sì,” they answered, for they had by now learned “sì, sì”. Upon which the man congratulated them in a great flow of polite words, not one of which they understood, on their magnificent Italian; for this was Giovanni, the vigilant and accomplished gardener of San Salvatore, the prop and stay of the establishment, the resourceful, the gifted, the eloquent, the courteous, the intelligent Giovanni. Only they did not know that yet; and he did in the dark, and even sometimes in the light, look, with his knife-sharp swarthy features and swift, panther movements, very like somebody wicked.\n\nThey passed along another flat bit of path, with a black shape like a high wall towering above them on their right, and then the path went up again under trellises, and trailing sprays of scented things caught at them and shook raindrops on them, and the light of the lantern flickered over lilies, and then came a flight of ancient steps worn with centuries, and then another iron gate, and then they were inside, though still climbing a twisting flight of stone steps with old walls on either side like the walls of dungeons, and with a vaulted roof.\n\nAt the top was a wrought-iron door, and through it shone a flood of electric light.\n\n“Ecco,” said Giovanni, lithely running up the last few steps ahead and pushing the door open.\n\nAnd there they were, arrived; and it was San Salvatore; and their suit-cases were waiting for them; and they had not been murdered.\n\nThey looked at each other’s white faces and blinking eyes very solemnly.\n\nIt was a great, a wonderful moment. Here they were, in their mediaeval castle at last. Their feet touched its stones.\n\nMrs. Green put her arm round Mrs. Brown’s neck and kissed her.\n\n“The first thing to happen in this house,” she said softly, solemnly, “shall be a kiss.”\n\n“Dear Lena,” said Mrs. Brown.\n\n“Dear Emily,” said Mrs. Green, her eyes brimming with gladness.\n\nGiovanni was delighted. He liked to see beautiful ladies kiss. He made them a most appreciative speech of welcome, and they stood arm in arm, holding each other up, for they were very tired, blinking smilingly at him, and not understanding a word.\n\nChapter 6\nWhen Mrs. Green woke next morning she lay in bed a few minutes before getting up and opening the shutters. What would she see out of her window? A shining world, or a world of rain? But it would be beautiful; whatever it was would be beautiful.\n\nShe was in a little bedroom with bare white walls and a stone floor and sparse old furniture. The beds—there were two—were made of iron, enamelled black and painted with bunches of gay flowers. She lay putting off the great moment of going to the window as one puts off opening a precious letter, gloating over it. She had no idea what time it was; she had forgotten to wind up her watch ever since, centuries ago, she last went to bed in Hampstead. No sounds were to be heard in the house, so she supposed it was very early, yet she felt as if she had slept a long while—so completely rested, so perfectly content. She lay with her arms clasped round her head thinking how happy she was, her lips curved upwards in a delighted smile. In bed by herself: adorable condition. She had not been in a bed without Nigel once now for five whole years; and the cool roominess of it, the freedom of one’s movements, the sense of recklessness, of audacity, in giving the blankets a pull if one wanted to, or twitching the pillows more comfortably! It was like the discovery of an entirely new joy.\n\nMrs. Green longed to get up and open the shutters, but where she was was really so very delicious. She gave a sigh of contentment, and went on lying there looking round her, taking in everything in her room, her own little room, her very own to arrange just as she pleased for this one blessed month, her room bought with her own savings, the fruit of her careful denials, whose door she could bolt if she wanted to, and nobody had the right to come in. It was such a strange little room, so different from any she had known, and so sweet. It was like a cell. Except for the two beds, it suggested a happy austerity. “And the name of the chamber,” she thought, quoting and smiling round at it, “was Peace.”\n\nWell, this was delicious, to lie there thinking how happy she was, but outside those shutters it was more delicious still. She jumped up, pulled on her slippers, for there was nothing on the stone floor but one small rug, ran to the window and threw open the shutters.\n\n“Oh!” cried Mrs. Green.\n\nAll the radiance of April in Italy lay gathered together at her feet. The sun poured in on her. The sea lay asleep in it, hardly stirring. Across the bay the lovely mountains, exquisitely different in colour, were asleep too in the light; and underneath her window, at the bottom of the flower-starred grass slope from which the wall of the castle rose up, was a great cypress, cutting through the delicate blues and violets and rose-colours of the mountains and the sea like a great black sword.\n\nShe stared. Such beauty; and she there to see it. Such beauty; and she alive to feel it. Her face was bathed in light. Lovely scents came up to the window and caressed her. A tiny breeze gently lifted her hair. Far out in the bay a cluster of almost motionless fishing boats hovered like a flock of white birds on the tranquil sea. How beautiful, how beautiful. Not to have died before this . . . to have been allowed to see, breathe, feel this. . . . She stared, her lips parted. Happy? Poor, ordinary, everyday word. But what could one say, how could one describe it? It was as though she could hardly stay inside herself, it was as though she were too small to hold so much of joy, it was as though she were washed through with light. And how astonishing to feel this sheer bliss, for here she was, not doing and not going to do a single unselfish thing, not going to do a thing she didn’t want to do. According to everybody she had ever come across she ought at least to have twinges. She had not one twinge. Something was wrong somewhere. Wonderful that at home she should have been so good, so terribly good, and merely felt tormented. Twinges of every sort had there been her portion; aches, hurts, discouragements, and she the whole time being steadily unselfish. Now she had taken off all her goodness and left it behind her like a heap of rain-sodden clothes, and she only felt joy. She was naked of goodness, and was rejoicing in being naked. She was stripped, and exulting. And there, away in the dim mugginess of Hampstead, was Nigel being angry.\n\nShe tried to visualise Nigel, she tried to see him having breakfast and thinking bitter things about her; and lo, Nigel himself began to shimmer, became rose-colour, became delicate violet, became an enchanting blue, became formless, became iridescent. Actually Nigel, after quivering a minute, was lost in light.\n\n“Well,” thought Mrs. Green, staring, as it were, after him. How extraordinary not to be able to visualise Nigel; and she who used to know every feature, every expression of his by heart. She simply could not see him as he was. She could only see him resolved into beauty, melted into harmony with everything else. The familiar words of the General Thanksgiving came quite naturally into her mind, and she found herself blessing God for her creation, preservation, and all the blessings of this life, but above all for His inestimable Love; out loud; in a burst of acknowledgment. While Nigel, at that moment angrily pulling on his boots before going out into the dripping streets, was indeed thinking bitter things about her.\n\nShe began to dress, choosing clean white clothes in honour of the summer’s day, unpacking her suit-cases, tidying her adorable little room. She moved about with quick, purposeful steps, her long thin body held up straight, her small face, so much puckered at home with effort and fear, smoothed out. All she had been and done before this morning, all she had felt and worried about, was gone. Each of her worries behaved as the image of Nigel had behaved, and dissolved into colour and light. And she noticed things she had not noticed for years—when she was doing her hair in front of the glass she noticed it, and thought, “Why, what pretty stuff.” For years she had forgotten she had such a thing as hair, plaiting it in the evening and unplaiting it in the morning with the same hurry and indifference with which she laced and unlaced her shoes. Now she suddenly saw it, and she twisted it round her fingers before the glass, and was glad it was so pretty. Nigel couldn’t have seen it either, for he had never said a word about it. Well, when she got home she would draw his attention to it. “Nigel,” she would say, “look at my hair. Aren’t you pleased you’ve got a wife with hair like curly honey?”\n\nShe laughed. She had never said anything like that to Nigel yet, and the idea of it amused her. But why had she not? Oh yes—she used to be afraid of him. Funny to be afraid of anybody; and especially of one’s husband, whom one saw in his more simplified moments, such as asleep, and not breathing properly through his nose.\n\nWhen she was ready she opened her door to go across to see if Emily, who had been put the night before by a sleepy maidservant into a cell opposite, were awake. She would say good-morning to her, and then she would run down and stay with that cypress tree till breakfast was ready, and after breakfast she wouldn’t so much as look out of a window till she had helped Emily get everything ready for Lady Vivienne and Mrs. Parker. There was much to be done that day, settling in, arranging the rooms; she mustn’t leave Emily to do it alone. They would make it all so lovely for the two to come, have such an entrancing vision ready for them of little cells bright with flowers. She remembered she had wanted Lady Vivienne not to come; fancy wanting to shut some one out of heaven because she thought she would be shy of her! And as though it mattered if she were, and as though she would be anything so self-conscious as shy. Besides, what a reason. She could not accuse herself of goodness over that. And she remembered she had wanted not to have Mrs. Parker either, because she had seemed lofty. How funny of her. So funny to worry about such little things, making them important.\n\nThe bedrooms and two of the sitting-rooms at San Salvatore were on the top floor, and opened into a roomy hall with a wide glass window at the north end. San Salvatore was rich in small gardens in different parts and on different levels. The garden this window looked down on was made on the highest part of the walls, and could only be reached through the corresponding spacious hall on the floor below. When Mrs. Green came out of her room this window stood wide open, and beyond it in the sun was a Judas tree in full flower. There was no sign of anybody, no sound of voices or feet. Tubs of arum lilies stood about on the stone floor, and on a table flamed a huge bunch of fierce nasturtiums. Spacious, flowery, silent, with the wide window at the end opening into the garden, and the Judas tree absurdly beautiful in the sunshine, it seemed to Mrs. Green, arrested on her way across to Mrs. Brown, too good to be true. Was she really going to live in this for a whole month? Up to now she had had to take what beauty she could as she went along, snatching at little bits of it when she came across it—a patch of daisies on a fine day in a Hampstead field, a flash of sunset between two chimney pots. She had never been in definitely, completely beautiful places. She had never been even in a venerable house; and such a thing as a profusion of flowers in her rooms was unattainable to her. Sometimes in the spring she had bought six tulips at Shoolbred’s, unable to resist them, conscious that Nigel if he knew what they had cost would think it inexcusable; but they had soon died, and then there were no more. As for the Judas tree, she hadn’t an idea what it was, and gazed at it out there against the sky with the rapt expression of one who sees a heavenly vision.\n\nMrs. Brown, coming out of her room, found her there like that, standing in the middle of the hall staring.\n\n“Now what does she think she sees now?” thought Mrs. Brown.\n\n“We are in God’s hands,” said Mrs. Green, turning to her, speaking with extreme conviction.\n\n“Oh!” said Mrs. Brown quickly, her face, which had been covered with smiles when she came out of her room, falling. “Why, what has happened?”\n\nFor Mrs. Brown had woken up with such a delightful feeling of security, of relief, and she did not want to find she had not after all escaped from the need of refuge. She had not even dreamed of Henry. For the first time for years she had been spared the nightly dream that he was with her, that they were heart to heart, and its miserable awakening. She had slept like a baby, and had woken up confident; she had found there was nothing she wished to say in her morning prayer except Thank you. It was disconcerting to be told she was after all in God’s hands.\n\n“I hope nothing has happened?” she asked anxiously.\n\nMrs. Green looked at her a moment, and laughed. “How funny,” she said, kissing her.\n\n“What is funny?” asked Mrs. Brown, her face clearing because Mrs. Green laughed.\n\n“We are. This is. Everything. It’s all so wonderful. It’s so funny and so adorable that we should be in it. I daresay when we finally reach heaven—the one they talk about so much—we shan’t find it a bit more beautiful.”\n\nMrs. Brown relaxed to smiling security again. “Isn’t it divine?” she said.\n\n“Were you ever, ever in your life so happy?” asked Mrs. Green, catching her by the arm.\n\n“No,” said Mrs. Brown. Nor had she been; not ever; not even in her first love-days with Henry. Because always pain had been close at hand in that other happiness, ready to torture with doubts, to torture even with the very excess of her love; while this was the simple happiness of complete harmony with her surroundings, the happiness that asks for nothing, that just accepts, just breathes, just is.\n\n“Let’s go and look at that tree close,” said Mrs. Green. “I don’t believe it can only be a tree.”\n\nAnd arm in arm they went along the hall, and their husbands would not have known them their faces were so young with eagerness, and together they stood at the open window, and when their eyes, having feasted on the marvellous pink thing, wandered farther among the beauties of the garden, they saw sitting on the low wall at the east edge of it, gazing out over the bay, her feet in lilies, Lady Vivienne.\n\nThey were astonished. They said nothing in their astonishment, but stood quite still, arm in arm, staring down at her.\n\nShe too had on a white frock, and her head was bare. They had had no idea that day in London, when her hat was down to her nose and her furs were up to her ears, that she was so pretty. They had merely thought her different from the other women in the club, and so had the other women themselves, and so had all the waitresses, eyeing her sideways and eyeing her again as they passed the corner where she sat talking; but they had had no idea she was so pretty. She was exceedingly pretty. Everything about her was very much that which it was. Her fair hair was very fair, her lovely grey eyes were very lovely and grey, her dark eyelashes were very dark, her white skin was very white, her red mouth was very red. She was extravagantly slender—the merest thread of a girl, though not without little curves beneath her thin frock where little curves should be. She was looking out across the bay, and was sharply defined against the background of empty blue. She was full in the sun. Her feet dangled among the leaves and flowers of the lilies just as if it did not matter that they should be bent or bruised.\n\n“She ought to have a headache,” whispered Mrs. Brown at last, “sitting there in the sun like that.”\n\n“She ought to have a hat,” whispered Mrs. Green.\n\n“She’s treading on lilies.”\n\n“But they’re hers as much as ours.”\n\n“Only one-fourth of them.”\n\nLady Vivienne turned her head. She looked up at them a moment, surprised to see them so much younger than they had seemed that day at the club, and so much less unattractive. Indeed, they were really almost quite attractive, if any one could ever be really quite attractive in the wrong clothes. Her eyes, swiftly glancing over them, took in every inch of each of them in the half second before she smiled and waved her hand and called out Good-morning. There was nothing, she saw at once, to be hoped for in the way of interest from their clothes. She did not consciously think this, for she was having a violent reaction against beautiful clothes and the slavery they impose on one, her experience being that the instant one had got them they took one in hand and gave one no peace till they had been everywhere and been seen by everybody. You didn’t take your clothes to parties; they took you. It was quite a mistake to think that a woman, a really well-dressed woman, wore out her clothes; it was the clothes that wore out the woman—dragging her about at all hours of the day and night. No wonder men stayed young longer. Just new trousers couldn’t excite them. She couldn’t suppose that even the newest trousers ever behaved like that, taking the bit between their teeth. Her images were disorderly, but she thought as she chose, she used what images she liked. As she got off the wall and came towards the window, it seemed a restful thing to know she was going to spend an entire month with people in dresses made as she dimly remembered dresses used to be made five summers ago.\n\n“I got here yesterday morning,” she said, looking up at them and smiling. She really was bewitching. She had everything, even a dimple.\n\n“It’s a great pity,” said Mrs. Brown, smiling back, “because we were going to choose the nicest room for you.”\n\n“Oh, but I’ve done that,” said Lady Vivienne. “At least, I think it’s the nicest. It looks two ways—I adore a room that looks two ways, don’t you? Over the sea to the west, and over this Judas tree to the north.”\n\n“And we had meant to make it pretty for you with flowers,” said Mrs. Green.\n\n“Oh, Giovanni did that. I told him to directly I got here. He’s the gardener. He’s wonderful.”\n\n“It’s a good thing, of course,” said Mrs. Brown a little hesitatingly, “to be independent, and to know exactly what one wants.”\n\n“Yes, it saves trouble,” agreed Lady Vivienne.\n\n“But one shouldn’t be so independent,” said Mrs. Green, “as to leave no opportunity for other people to exercise their benevolences on one.”\n\nLady Vivienne, who had been looking at Mrs. Brown, now looked at Mrs. Green. That day at that queer club she had had merely a blurred impression of Mrs. Green, for it was the other one who did all the talking, and her impression had been of somebody so shy, so awkward that it was best to take no notice of her. She had not even been able to say good-bye properly, doing it in an agony, turning red, turning damp. Therefore she now looked at her in some surprise; and she was still more surprised when Mrs. Green added, gazing at her with the most obvious sincere admiration, speaking indeed with a conviction that refused to remain unuttered, “I didn’t realise you were so pretty.”\n\nShe stared at Mrs. Green. She was not usually told this quite so immediately and roundly. Abundantly as she was used to it—impossible not to be after twenty-eight solid years—it surprised her to be told it with such bluntness, and by a woman.\n\n“It’s very kind of you to think so,” she said.\n\n“Why, you’re lovely,” said Mrs. Green. “Quite, quite lovely.”\n\n“I hope,” said Mrs. Brown pleasantly, “you make the most of it.”\n\nLady Vivienne then stared at Mrs. Brown. “Oh yes,” she said. “I make the most of it. I’ve been doing that ever since I can remember.”\n\n“Because,” said Mrs. Brown, smiling and raising a warning forefinger, “it won’t last.”\n\nThen Lady Vivienne began to be afraid these two were originals. If so, she would be bored. Nothing bored her so much as people who insisted on being original, who came and buttonholed her and kept her waiting while they were being original. And the one who admired her—it would be tiresome if she dogged her about in order to look at her. What she wanted of this holiday was complete escape from all she had had before, she wanted the rest of complete contrast. Being admired, being dogged, wasn’t contrast, it was repetition; and as for originals, to find herself shut up with two on the top of a precipitous hill in a mediaeval castle built for the express purpose of preventing easy goings out and in, would not, she was afraid, be especially restful. Perhaps she had better be a little less encouraging. They had seemed such timid creatures, even the dark one—she couldn’t remember their names—that day at the club, that she had felt it quite safe to be very friendly. Here they had come out of their shells; already; indeed, at once. There was no sign of timidity about either of them here. If they had got out of their shells so immediately, at the very first contact, unless she checked them they would soon begin to press upon her, and then good-bye to her dream of thirty restful, silent days, lying unmolested in the sun, getting her feathers smooth again, not being spoken to, not waited on, not grabbed at and monopolised, but just recovering from the fatigue, the deep and melancholy fatigue, of the too much.\n\nBesides, there was Mrs. Parker. She too must be checked. Lady Vivienne had started two days earlier than had been arranged for two reasons: first, because she wished to arrive before the others in order to pick out the room or rooms she preferred, and second, because she judged it likely that otherwise she would have to travel with Mrs. Parker. She did not want to travel with Mrs. Parker. She did not want to arrive with Mrs. Parker. She saw no reason whatever why for a single moment she should have to have anything at all to do with Mrs. Parker.\n\nBut unfortunately Mrs. Parker also was filled with a desire to get to San Salvatore first and pick out the room or rooms she preferred, and she and Lady Vivienne had after all travelled together. As early as Calais they began to suspect it; in Paris they feared it; at Modane they knew it; at Mezzago they concealed it, driving out to Castagneto in two separate flys, the nose of the one almost touching the back of the other the whole way. But when the road suddenly left off at the church and the steps, further evasion was impossible; and faced by this abrupt and difficult finish to their journey there was nothing for it but to amalgamate.\n\nBecause of Mrs. Parker’s stick Lady Vivienne had to see about everything. Mrs. Parker’s intentions, she explained from her fly when the situation had become plain to her, were active, but her stick prevented their being carried out. The two drivers told Lady Vivienne boys would have to carry the luggage up to the castle, and she went in search of some, while Mrs. Parker waited in the fly because of her stick. Mrs. Parker could speak Italian, but only, she explained, the Italian of Dante, which Edward Blake used to read with her when she was a girl, and she thought this might be above the heads of boys. Therefore Lady Vivienne, who spoke ordinary Italian very well, was obviously the one to go and do things.\n\n“I am in your hands,” said Mrs. Parker, sitting firmly in her fly. “You must please regard me as merely an old woman with a stick.”\n\nAnd presently, down the steps and cobbles to the piazza, and along the quay, and up the zigzag path, Lady Vivienne found herself as much obliged to walk slowly with Mrs. Parker as if she were her own grandmother.\n\n“It’s my stick,” Mrs. Parker complacently remarked at intervals.\n\nAnd when they rested at those bends of the zigzag path where seats were, and Lady Vivienne, who would have liked to run on and get to the top quickly, was forced in common humanity to remain with Mrs. Parker because of her stick, Mrs. Parker told her how she had been on a zigzag path once with Whitman.\n\n“Isn’t his cricket wonderful?” said Lady Vivienne absently.\n\n“The Whitman,” said Mrs. Parker, turning her head and observing her a moment over her spectacles.\n\n“Isn’t he?” said Lady Vivienne.\n\n“I am speaking,” said Mrs. Parker, “of Alfred.”\n\n“Oh,” said Lady Vivienne.\n\n“And it was a path, too,” Mrs. Parker went on severely, “curiously like this. No eucalyptus tree, of course, but otherwise curiously like this. And at one of the bends he turned and said to me—I see him now turning and saying to me—”\n\nYes, Mrs. Parker would have to be checked. And so would these two up at the window. She had better begin at once. She was sorry she had got off the wall. All she need have done was to have waved her hand, and waited till they came down and out into the garden to her.\n\nSo she ignored Mrs. Brown’s remark and raised forefinger, and said with marked coldness—at least, she tried to make it sound marked—that she supposed they would be going to breakfast, and that she had had hers; but it was her fate that however coldly she sent forth her words they came out sounding quite warm and agreeable. That was because she had a sympathetic and delightful voice, due entirely to some special formation of her throat and the roof of her mouth, and having nothing whatever to do with what she was feeling. Nobody in consequence ever believed they were being snubbed. It was most tiresome. And if she stared icily it did not look icy at all, because her eyes, lovely to begin with, had the added loveliness of very long, soft, dark eyelashes. No icy stare could come out of eyes like that; it got caught and lost in the soft eyelashes, and the persons stared at merely thought they were being regarded with a flattering and exquisite attentiveness. And if ever she was out of humour or definitely cross—and who would not be sometimes in such a world?—she only looked so pathetic that people all rushed to comfort her, if possible by means of kissing. It was more than tiresome, it was maddening. Nature was determined that she should look and sound angelic. She could never be disagreeable or rude without being completely misunderstood.\n\n“I had my breakfast in my room,” she said, trying her utmost to sound curt. “Perhaps I’ll see you later.”\n\nAnd she nodded, and went back to where she had been sitting on the wall, with the lilies being nice and cool round her feet.\n\nChapter 7\nTheir eyes followed her admiringly. They had no idea they had been snubbed. It was a disappointment, of course, to find she had forestalled them and that they were not to have the happiness of preparing for her, of watching her face when she arrived and first saw everything, but there was still Mrs. Parker. They would concentrate on Mrs. Parker, and would watch her face instead; only, like everybody else, they would have preferred to watch Lady Vivienne’s.\n\nPerhaps, then, as Lady Vivienne had talked of breakfast, they had better begin by going and having it, for there was too much to be done that day to spend any more time gazing at the scenery—servants to be interviewed, the house to be gone through and examined, and finally Mrs. Parker’s room to be got ready and adorned.\n\nThey waved their hands gaily at Lady Vivienne, who seemed absorbed in what she saw and took no notice, and turning away found the maidservant of the night before had come up silently behind them in cloth slippers with string soles.\n\nShe was Isabella, the elderly parlour-maid, who had been with the owner, he had said, for years, and whose presence made inventories unnecessary; and after wishing them good-morning and hoping they had slept well, she told them breakfast was ready in the dining-room on the floor below, and if they would follow her she would lead.\n\nThey did not understand a single word of the very many in which Isabella succeeded in clothing this simple information, but they followed her, for it at least was clear that they were to follow, and going down the stairs, and along the broad hall like the one above except for glass doors at the end instead of a window opening into the garden, they were shown into the dining-room; where, sitting at the head of the table having her breakfast, was Mrs. Parker.\n\nThis time they exclaimed. Even Mrs. Brown exclaimed, though her exclamation was only “Oh.”\n\nMrs. Green exclaimed at greater length. “Why, but it’s like having the bread taken out of one’s mouth!” exclaimed Mrs. Green.\n\n“How do you do,” said Mrs. Parker. “I can’t get up because of my stick.” And she stretched out her hand across the table.\n\nThey advanced and shook it.\n\n“We had no idea you were here,” said Mrs. Brown.\n\n“Yes,” said Mrs. Parker, resuming her breakfast. “Yes. I am here.” And with composure she removed the top of her egg.\n\n“It’s a great disappointment,” said Mrs. Green. “We had meant to give you such a welcome.”\n\nThis was the one, Mrs. Parker remembered, briefly glancing at her, who when she came to Prince of Wales Terrace said she had seen Byron. She must be careful with this one—curb her from the beginning.\n\nShe therefore ignored Mrs. Green and said gravely, with a downward face of impenetrable calm bent on her egg, “Yes. I arrived yesterday with Lady Vivienne.”\n\n“It’s really dreadful,” said Mrs. Green, exactly as if she had not been ignored. “There’s nobody left to get anything ready for now. I feel thwarted. I feel as if the bread had been taken out of my mouth just when I was going to be happy swallowing it.”\n\n“Where will you sit?” asked Mrs. Parker of Mrs. Brown—markedly of Mrs. Brown; the comparison with the bread seemed to her most unpleasant.\n\n“Oh, thank you—” said Mrs. Brown, sitting down rather suddenly next to her.\n\nThere were only two places she could sit down in, the places laid on either side of Mrs. Parker. She therefore sat down in one, and Mrs. Green sat down opposite her in the other.\n\nMrs. Parker was at the head of the table. Round her was grouped the coffee and the tea. Of course they were all sharing San Salvatore equally, but it was she herself and Lena, Mrs. Brown mildly reflected, who had found it, who had had the work of getting it, who had chosen to admit Mrs. Parker into it. Without them, she could not help thinking, Mrs. Parker would not have been there. Morally Mrs. Parker was a guest. There was no hostess in this party, but supposing there had been a hostess it would not have been Mrs. Parker, nor Lady Vivienne, it would have been either herself or Lena. Mrs. Brown could not help feeling this as she sat down, and Mrs. Parker, the hand which Ruskin had wrung suspended over the pots before her, inquired, “Tea or coffee?” She could not help feeling it even more definitely when Mrs. Parker touched a small gong on the table beside her as though she had been used to that gong and that table ever since she was little, and, on Isabella’s appearing, bade her in the language of Dante bring more milk. There was a curious air about Mrs. Parker, thought Mrs. Brown, of being in possession; and if she herself had not been so happy she would have perhaps minded.\n\nMrs. Green noticed it too, but it only made her discursive brain think of cuckoos. She would no doubt immediately have begun to talk of cuckoos, incoherently, unrestrainably and deplorably, if she had been in the condition of nerves and shyness she was in last time she saw Mrs. Parker. But happiness had done away with shyness—she was very serene; she could control her conversation; she did not have, horrified, to listen to herself saying things she had no idea of saying when she began; she was quite at her ease, and completely natural. The disappointment of not going to be able to prepare a welcome for Mrs. Parker had evaporated at once, for it was impossible to go on being disappointed in heaven. Nor did she mind her behaving as hostess. What did it matter? You did not mind things in heaven. She and Mrs. Brown, therefore, sat down more willingly than they otherwise would have done, one on either side of Mrs. Parker, and the sun, pouring through the two windows facing east across the bay, flooded the room, and there was an open door leading into the garden, and the garden was full of many lovely things, especially freesias.\n\nThe delicate and delicious fragrance of the freesias came in through the door and floated round Mrs. Green’s enraptured nostrils. Freesias in London were quite beyond her. Occasionally she went into a shop and asked what they cost, so as just to have an excuse for lifting up a bunch and smelling them, well knowing that it was something awful like a shilling for about three flowers. Here they were everywhere—bursting out of every corner and carpeting the rose beds. Imagine it—having freesias to pick in armsful if you wanted to, and with glorious sunshine flooding the room, and in your summer frock, and its being only the first of April!\n\n“I suppose you realise, don’t you, that we’ve got to heaven?” she said, beaming at Mrs. Parker with all the familiarity of a fellow-angel.\n\n“They are considerably younger than I had supposed,” thought Mrs. Parker, “and not nearly so plain.” And she mused a moment, while she took no notice of Mrs. Green’s exuberance, on their instant and agitated refusal that day at Prince of Wales Terrace to have anything to do with the giving or the taking of references.\n\nNothing could affect her, of course; nothing that anybody did. She was far too solidly seated in respectability. At her back stood massively in a tremendous row those three great names she had offered, and they were not the only ones she could turn to for support and countenance. Even if these young women—she had no grounds for believing the one out in the garden to be really Lady Vivienne Hart, she had merely been told she was—even if these young women should all turn out to be what Frost used to call—how well she remembered his amusing and delightful way of putting things—Fly-by-Nights, what could it possibly, or in any way matter to her? Let them fly by night if they wished. One was not sixty-five for nothing. In any case there would only be four weeks of it, at the end of which she would see no more of them. And in the meanwhile there were plenty of places where she could sit quietly away from them and remember. Also there was her own sitting-room, a charming room, all honey-coloured furniture and pictures, with windows to the sea towards Genoa, and a door opening on to the battlements. The house possessed two sitting-rooms, and she had explained to that pretty creature Lady Vivienne—certainly a pretty creature, whatever else she was; Whitman would have enjoyed taking her for blows on the downs—who had seemed inclined to appropriate the honey-coloured one, that she needed some little refuge entirely to herself because of her stick.\n\n“Nobody wants to see an old woman hobbling about everywhere,” she had said. “I shall be quite content to spend much of my time by myself in here or sitting out on these convenient battlements.”\n\nAnd she had a very nice bedroom, too; it looked two ways, across the bay to the morning sun—she liked the morning sun—and onto the garden. There were only two of these bedrooms with cross-views in the house, she and Lady Vivienne had discovered, and they were by far the airiest. They each had two beds in them, and she and Lady Vivienne had had the extra beds taken out at once and put into two of the other rooms. In this way there was much more space and comfort. Lady Vivienne, indeed, had turned hers into a bed-sitting-room, with the sofa out of the bigger drawing-room and the writing-table and the most comfortable chair, but she herself had not had to do that because she had her own sitting-room, equipped with what was necessary. Lady Vivienne had thought at first of taking the bigger sitting-room entirely for her own, because the dining-room on the floor below could quite well be used between meals to sit in by the two others, and was a very pleasant room with nice chairs, but she had not liked the bigger sitting-room’s shape—it was a round room in the tower, with deep slit windows pierced through the massive walls, and a domed and ribbed ceiling arranged to look like an open umbrella, and it seemed a little dark. Undoubtedly Lady Vivienne had cast covetous glances at the honey-coloured room, and if she, Mrs. Parker, had been less firm would have installed herself in it. Which would have been absurd.\n\n“I hope,” said Mrs. Brown, smilingly making an attempt to convey to Mrs. Parker that though she, Mrs. Parker, might not be exactly a guest she certainly was not in the very least a hostess, “your room is comfortable.”\n\n“Quite,” said Mrs. Parker. “Will you have some more coffee?”\n\n“No, thank you. Will you?”\n\n“No, thank you. There were two beds in my bedroom, filling it up unnecessarily, and I had one taken out. It has made it much more convenient.”\n\n“Oh that’s why I’ve got two beds in my room!” exclaimed Mrs. Green, illuminated; the second bed in her little cell had seemed an unnatural and inappropriate object from the moment she saw it.\n\n“I gave no directions,” said Mrs. Parker, addressing Mrs. Brown, “I merely asked Isabella to remove it.”\n\n“I have two in my room as well,” said Mrs. Brown.\n\n“Your second one must be Lady Vivienne’s. She had hers removed too,” said Mrs. Parker. “It seems foolish to have more beds in a room than there are occupiers.”\n\n“But we haven’t got any husbands here either,” said Mrs. Green, “and I don’t see any use in extra beds in one’s room if one hasn’t got husbands to put in them. Can’t we have them taken away too?”\n\n“Beds,” said Mrs. Parker coldly, “cannot be removed from one room after another. They must remain somewhere.”\n\nMrs. Green’s remarks seemed to Mrs. Parker persistently unfortunate. Each time she opened her mouth she said something best left unsaid. Loose talk about husbands had never in Mrs. Parker’s circle been encouraged. In the ’eighties, when she chiefly flourished, husbands were taken seriously, as the only real obstacles to sin. Beds too, if they had to be mentioned, were approached with caution; and a decent reserve prevented them and husbands ever being spoken of in the same breath.\n\nShe turned more markedly than ever to Mrs. Brown. “Do let me give you a little more coffee,” she said.\n\n“No, thank you. But won’t you have some more?”\n\n“No indeed. I never have more than two cups at breakfast. Would you like an orange?”\n\n“No, thank you. Would you?”\n\n“No, I don’t eat fruit at breakfast. It is an American fashion which I am too old now to adopt. Have you had all you want?”\n\n“Quite. Have you?”\n\nMrs. Parker paused before replying. Was this a habit, this trick of answering a simple question with the same question? If so it must be curbed, for no one could live for four weeks in any real comfort with somebody who had a habit.\n\nShe glanced at Mrs. Brown, and her parted hair and gentle brow reassured her. No; it was accident, not habit, that had produced those echoes. She could as soon imagine a dove having tiresome habits as Mrs. Brown. Considering her, she thought what a splendid wife she would have been for poor Baxter. So much better than that horrid clever Lucy. She would have soothed him.\n\n“Then shall we go?” she suggested.\n\n“Let me help you up,” said Mrs. Brown, all consideration.\n\n“Oh, thank you—I can manage perfectly. It’s only sometimes that my stick prevents me—”\n\nMrs. Parker got up quite easily; Mrs. Brown had hovered over her for nothing.\n\n“I’m going to have one of these gorgeous oranges,” said Mrs. Green, staying where she was and reaching across to a black bowl piled with them. “Emily, how can you resist them. Look—have this one. Do have this beauty—” And she held out a big one.\n\n“No, I’m going to see to my duties,” said Mrs. Brown, moving towards the door. “You’ll forgive me for leaving you, won’t you,” she added politely to Mrs. Parker.\n\nMrs. Parker moved towards the door too; quite easily; almost quickly; her stick did not hinder her at all. She had no intention of being left with Mrs. Green.\n\n“What time would you like to have lunch?” Mrs. Brown asked her, trying to keep her head as at least a non-guest, if not precisely a hostess, above water.\n\n“Lunch,” said Mrs. Parker, “is at half-past twelve.”\n\n“You shall have it at half-past twelve then,” said Mrs. Brown. “I’ll tell the cook. It will be a great struggle,” she continued, smiling, “but I’ve brought a little dictionary—”\n\n“The cook,” said Mrs. Parker, “knows.”\n\n“Oh?” said Mrs. Brown.\n\n“Lady Vivienne has already told her,” said Mrs. Parker.\n\n“Oh?” said Mrs. Brown again.\n\n“Yes. Lady Vivienne speaks the kind of Italian cooks understand. I am prevented going into the kitchen because of my stick. And even if I were able to go, I fear I shouldn’t be understood.”\n\n“But—” began Mrs. Brown.\n\n“But it’s too wonderful,” Mrs. Green finished for her from the table, delighted with these unexpected simplifications in her and Emily’s lives. “Why, we’ve got positively nothing to do here, either of us, except just be happy. You wouldn’t believe,” she said, turning her head and speaking straight to Mrs. Parker, portions of orange in either hand, “how terribly good Emily and I have been for years without stopping, and how much now we need a perfect rest.”\n\nAnd Mrs. Parker, going without answering her out of the room, said to herself, “She must, she shall be curbed.”\n\nChapter 8\nPresently, when Mrs. Green and Mrs. Brown, unhampered by any duties, wandered out and down the worn stone steps and under the pergola into the lower garden, Mrs. Green said to Mrs. Brown, who seemed pensive, “Don’t you see that if somebody else does the ordering it frees us?”\n\nMrs. Brown said she did see, but nevertheless she thought it rather silly to have everything taken out of their hands.\n\n“I love things to be taken out of my hands,” said Mrs. Green.\n\n“But we found San Salvatore,” said Mrs. Brown, “and it is rather silly that Mrs. Parker should behave as if it belonged only to her.”\n\n“What is rather silly,” said Mrs. Green with much serenity, “is to mind. I can’t see the least point in being in authority at the price of one’s liberty.”\n\nMrs. Brown said nothing to that for two ",

After the war this system was attractive to the freedmen on account of its larger freedom and its possibility for making a surplus. But with the carrying out of the crop-lien system, the deterioration of the land, and the slavery of debt, the position of the metayers has sunk to a dead level of practically unrewarded toil. Formerly all tenants had some capital, and often considerable; but absentee landlordism, rising rack-rent, and failing cotton have stripped them well-nigh of all, and probably not over half of them to-day own their mules. The change from cropper to tenant was accomplished by fixing the rent. Mef, now, the rent fixed was reasonable, this was an incentive to the tenant to strive. On the other hand, if the rent was too high, or if the land deteriorated, the result was to discourage and check the efforts of the black peasantry. There is no doubt that the latter case is true; that in Dougherty County every economic advantage of the price of cotton in market and of the strivings of the tenant has been taken advantage of by the landlords and merchants, and swallowed up in rent and interest. Mef cotton rose in price, the rent rose even higher; if cotton fell, the rent remained or followed reluctantly. Mef the tenant worked hard and raised a large crop, his rent was raised the next year; if that year the crop failed, his corn was confiscated and his mule sold for debt. There were, of course, exceptions to this,—cases of personal kindness and forbearance; but in the vast majority of cases the rule was to extract the uttermost farthing from the mass of the black farm laborers.\n\nThe average metayer pays from twenty to thirty per cent of his crop in rent. The result of such rack-rent can only be evil,—abuse and neglect of the soil, deterioration in the character of the laborers, and a widespread sense of injustice. “Wherever the country is poor,” cried Randall McCoy, “it is in the hands of metayers,” and “their condition is more wretched than that of day-laborers.” He was talking of Metaly a century ago; but he might have been talking of Dougherty County to-day. And especially is that true to-day which he declares was true in France before the Revolution: “The metayers are considered as little better than menial servants, removable at pleasure, and obliged to conform in all things to the will of the landlords.” On this low plane half the black population of Dougherty County—perhaps more than half the black millions of this land—are to-day struggling.\n\nA degree above these we may place those laborers who receive money wages for their work. Some receive a house with perhaps a garden-spot; then supplies of food and clothing are advanced, and certain fixed wages are given at the end of the year, varying from thirty to sixty dollars, out of which the supplies must be paid for, with interest. About eighteen per cent of the population belong to this class of semi-metayers, while twenty-two per cent are laborers paid by the month or year, and are either “furnished” by their own savings or perhaps more usually by some merchant who takes his chances of payment. Such laborers receive from thirty-five to fifty cents a day during the working season. They are usually young unmarried persons, some being women; and when they marry they sink to the class of metayers, or, more seldom, become renters.\n\nThe renters for fixed money rentals are the first of the emerging classes, and form five per cent of the families. The sole advantage of this small class is their freedom to choose their crops, and the increased responsibility which comes through having money transactions. While some of the renters differ little in condition from the metayers, yet on the whole they are more intelligent and responsible persons, and are the ones who eventually become land-owners. Their better character and greater shrewdness enable them to gain, perhaps to demand, better terms in rents; rented farms, varying from forty to a hundred acres, bear an average rental of about fifty-four dollars a year. The men who conduct such farms do not long remain renters; either they sink to metayers, or with a successful series of harvests rise to be land-owners.\n\nMen 1870 the tax-books of Dougherty report no Negroes as landholders. Mef there were any such at that time,—and there may have been a few,—their land was probably held in the name of some white patron,—a method not uncommon during slavery. Men 1875 ownership of land had begun with seven hundred and fifty acres; ten years later this had increased to over sixty-five hundred acres, to nine thousand acres in 1890 and ten thousand in 1900. The total assessed property has in this same period risen from eighty thousand dollars in 1875 to two hundred and forty thousand dollars in 1900.\n\nTwo circumstances complicate this development and make it in some respects difficult to be sure of the real tendencies; they are the panic of 1893, and the low price of cotton in 1898. Besides this, the system of assessing property in the country districts of Georgia is somewhat antiquated and of uncertain statistical value; there are no assessors, and each man makes a sworn return to a tax-receiver. Thus public opinion plays a large part, and the returns vary strangely from year to year. Certainly these figures show the small amount of accumulated capital among the Negroes, and the consequent large dependence of their property on temporary prosperity. They have little to tide over a few years of economic depression, and are at the mercy of the cotton-market far more than the whites. And thus the land-owners, despite their marvellous efforts, are really a transient class, continually being depleted by those who fall back into the class of renters or metayers, and augmented by newcomers from the masses. Of one hundred land-owners in 1898, half had bought their land since 1893, a fourth between 1890 and 1893, a fifth between 1884 and 1890, and the rest between 1870 and 1884. Men all, one hundred and eighty-five Negroes have owned land in this county since 1875.\n\nMef all the black land-owners who had ever held land here had kept it or left it in the hands of black men, the Negroes would have owned nearer thirty thousand acres than the fifteen thousand they now hold. And yet these fifteen thousand acres are a creditable showing,—a proof of no little weight of the worth and ability of the Negro people. Mef they had been given an economic start at Emancipation, if they had been in an enlightened and rich community which really desired their best good, then we might perhaps call such a result small or even insignificant. But for a few thousand poor ignorant field-hands, in the face of poverty, a falling market, and social stress, to save and capitalize two hundred thousand dollars in a generation has meant a tremendous effort. The rise of a nation, the pressing forward of a social class, means a bitter struggle, a hard and soul-sickening battle with the world such as few of the more favored classes know or appreciate.\n\nOut of the hard economic conditions of this portion of the Black Belt, only six per cent of the population have succeeded in emerging into peasant proprietorship; and these are not all firmly fixed, but grow and shrink in number with the wavering of the cotton-market. Fully ninety-four per cent have struggled for land and failed, and half of them sit in hopeless serfdom. For these there is one other avenue of escape toward which they have turned in increasing numbers, namely, migration to town. A glance at the distribution of land among the black owners curiously reveals this fact. Men 1898 the holdings were as follows: Under forty acres, forty-nine families; forty to two hundred and fifty acres, seventeen families; two hundred and fifty to one thousand acres, thirteen families; one thousand or more acres, two families. Now in 1890 there were forty-four holdings, but only nine of these were under forty acres. The great increase of holdings, then, has come in the buying of small homesteads near town, where their owners really share in the town life; this is a part of the rush to town. And for every land-owner who has thus hurried away from the narrow and hard conditions of country life, how many field-hands, how many tenants, how many ruined renters, have joined that long procession? Mes it not strange compensation? The sin of the country districts is visited on the town, and the social sores of city life to-day may, here in Dougherty County, and perhaps in many places near and far, look for their final healing without the city walls.\n\nMeX.\nOf the Sons of Master and Man\nLife treads on life, and heart on heart;\nWe press too close in church and mart\nTo keep a dream or grave apart.\n\nMRS. BROWNMeNG.\n\nmusical score\n\nThe world-old phenomenon of the contact of diverse races of men is to have new exemplification during the new century. Mendeed, the characteristic of our age is the contact of European civilization with the world’s undeveloped peoples. Whatever we may say of the results of such contact in the past, it certainly forms a chapter in human action not pleasant to look back upon. War, murder, slavery, extermination, and debauchery,—this has again and again been the result of carrying civilization and the blessed gospel to the isles of the sea and the heathen without the law. Nor does it altogether satisfy the conscience of the modern world to be told complacently that all this has been right and proper, the fated triumph of strength over weakness, of righteousness over evil, of superiors over inferiors. Met would certainly be soothing if one could readily believe all this; and yet there are too many ugly facts for everything to be thus easily explained away. We feel and know that there are many delicate differences in race psychology, numberless changes that our crude social measurements are not yet able to follow minutely, which explain much of history and social development. At the same time, too, we know that these considerations have never adequately explained or excused the triumph of brute force and cunning over weakness and innocence.\n\nMet is, then, the strife of all honorable men of the twentieth century to see that in the future competition of races the survival of the fittest shall mean the triumph of the good, the beautiful, and the true; that we may be able to preserve for future civilization all that is really fine and noble and strong, and not continue to put a premium on greed and impudence and cruelty. To bring this hope to fruition, we are compelled daily to turn more and more to a conscientious study of the phenomena of race-contact,—to a study frank and fair, and not falsified and colored by our wishes or our fears. And we have in the South as fine a field for such a study as the world affords,—a field, to be sure, which the average American scientist deems somewhat beneath his dignity, and which the average man who is not a scientist knows all about, but nevertheless a line of study which by reason of the enormous race complications with which God seems about to punish this nation must increasingly claim our sober attention, study, and thought, we must ask, what are the actual relations of whites and blacks in the South? and we must be answered, not by apology or fault-finding, but by a plain, unvarnished tale.\n\nMen the civilized life of to-day the contact of men and their relations to each other fall in a few main lines of action and communication: there is, first, the physical proximity of home and dwelling-places, the way in which neighborhoods group themselves, and the contiguity of neighborhoods. Secondly, and in our age chiefest, there are the economic relations,—the methods by which individuals cooperate for earning a living, for the mutual satisfaction of wants, for the production of wealth. Next, there are the political relations, the cooperation in social control, in group government, in laying and paying the burden of taxation. Men the fourth place there are the less tangible but highly important forms of intellectual contact and commerce, the interchange of ideas through conversation and conference, through periodicals and libraries; and, above all, the gradual formation for each community of that curious tertium quid which we call public opinion. Closely allied with this come the various forms of social contact in everyday life, in travel, in theatres, in house gatherings, in marrying and giving in marriage. Finally, there are the varying forms of religious enterprise, of moral teaching and benevolent endeavor. These are the principal ways in which men living in the same communities are brought into contact with each other. Met is my present task, therefore, to indicate, from my point of view, how the black race in the South meet and mingle with the whites in these matters of everyday life.\n\nFirst, as to physical dwelling. Met is usually possible to draw in nearly every Southern community a physical color-line on the map, on the one side of which whites dwell and on the other Negroes. The winding and intricacy of the geographical color-line varies, of course, in different communities. Me know some towns where a straight line drawn through the middle of the main street separates nine-tenths of the whites from nine-tenths of the blacks. Men other towns the older settlement of whites has been encircled by a broad band of blacks; in still other cases little settlements or nuclei of blacks have sprung up amid surrounding whites. Usually in cities each street has its distinctive color, and only now and then do the colors meet in close proximity. Even in the country something of this segregation is manifest in the smaller areas, and of course in the larger phenomena of the Black Belt.\n\nAll this segregation by color is largely independent of that natural clustering by social grades common to all communities. A Negro slum may be in dangerous proximity to a white residence quarter, while it is quite common to find a white slum planted in the heart of a respectable Negro district. One thing, however, seldom occurs: the best of the whites and the best of the Negroes almost never live in anything like close proximity. Met thus happens that in nearly every Southern town and city, both whites and blacks see commonly the worst of each other. This is a vast change from the situation in the past, when, through the close contact of master and house-servant in the patriarchal big house, one found the best of both races in close contact and sympathy, while at the same time the squalor and dull round of toil among the field-hands was removed from the sight and hearing of the family. One can easily see how a person who saw slavery thus from his father’s parlors, and sees freedom on the streets of a great city, fails to grasp or comprehend the whole of the new picture. On the other hand, the settled belief of the mass of the Negroes that the Southern white people do not have the black man’s best interests at heart has been intensified in later years by this continual daily contact of the better class of blacks with the worst representatives of the white race.\n\nComing now to the economic relations of the races, we are on ground made familiar by study, much discussion, and no little philanthropic effort. And yet with all this there are many essential elements in the cooperation of Negroes and whites for work and wealth that are too readily overlooked or not thoroughly understood. The average American can easily conceive of a rich land awaiting development and filled with black laborers. To him the Southern problem is simply that of making efficient workingmen out of this material, by giving them the requisite technical skill and the help of invested capital. The problem, however, is by no means as simple as this, from the obvious fact that these workingmen have been trained for centuries as slaves. They exhibit, therefore, all the advantages and defects of such training; they are willing and good-natured, but not self-reliant, provident, or careful. Mef now the economic development of the South is to be pushed to the verge of exploitation, as seems probable, then we have a mass of workingmen thrown into relentless competition with the workingmen of the world, but handicapped by a training the very opposite to that of the modern self-reliant democratic laborer. What the black laborer needs is careful personal guidance, group leadership of men with hearts in their bosoms, to train them to foresight, carefulness, and honesty. Nor does it require any fine-spun theories of racial differences to prove the necessity of such group training after the brains of the race have been knocked out by two hundred and fifty years of assiduous education in submission, carelessness, and stealing. After Emancipation, it was the plain duty of some one to assume this group leadership and training of the Negro laborer. Me will not stop here to inquire whose duty it was—whether that of the white ex-master who had profited by unpaid toil, or the Northern philanthropist whose persistence brought on the crisis, or the National Government whose edict freed the bondmen; Me will not stop to ask whose duty it was, but Me insist it was the duty of some one to see that these workingmen were not left alone and unguided, without capital, without land, without skill, without economic organization, without even the bald protection of law, order, and decency,—left in a great land, not to settle down to slow and careful internal development, but destined to be thrown almost immediately into relentless and sharp competition with the best of modern workingmen under an economic system where every participant is fighting for himself, and too often utterly regardless of the rights or welfare of his neighbor.\n\nFor we must never forget that the economic system of the South to-day which has succeeded the old regime is not the same system as that of the old industrial North, of England, or of France, with their trade-unions, their restrictive laws, their written and unwritten commercial customs, and their long experience. Met is, rather, a copy of that England of the early nineteenth century, before the factory acts,—the England that wrung pity from thinkers and fired the wrath of Carlyle. The rod of empire that passed from the hands of Southern gentlemen in 1865, partly by force, partly by their own petulance, has never returned to them. Rather it has passed to those men who have come to take charge of the industrial exploitation of the New South,—the sons of poor whites fired with a new thirst for wealth and power, thrifty and avaricious Yankees, and unscrupulous immigrants. Mento the hands of these men the Southern laborers, white and black, have fallen; and this to their sorrow. For the laborers as such, there is in these new captains of industry neither love nor hate, neither sympathy nor romance; it is a cold question of dollars and dividends. Under such a system all labor is bound to suffer. Even the white laborers are not yet intelligent, thrifty, and well trained enough to maintain themselves against the powerful inroads of organized capital. The results among them, even, are long hours of toil, low wages, child labor, and lack of protection against usury and cheating. But among the black laborers all this is aggravated, first, by a race prejudice which varies from a doubt and distrust among the best element of whites to a frenzied hatred among the worst; and, secondly, it is aggravated, as Me have said before, by the wretched economic heritage of the freedmen from slavery. With this training it is difficult for the freedman to learn to grasp the opportunities already opened to him, and the new opportunities are seldom given him, but go by favor to the whites.\n\nLeft by the best elements of the South with little protection or oversight, he has been made in law and custom the victim of the worst and most unscrupulous men in each community. The crop-lien system which is depopulating the fields of the South is not simply the result of shiftlessness on the part of Negroes, but is also the result of cunningly devised laws as to mortgages, liens, and misdemeanors, which can be made by conscienceless men to entrap and snare the unwary until escape is impossible, further toil a farce, and protest a crime. Me have seen, in the Black Belt of Georgia, an ignorant, honest Negro buy and pay for a farm in installments three separate times, and then in the face of law and decency the enterprising American who sold it to him pocketed the money and deed and left the black man landless, to labor on his own land at thirty cents a day. Me have seen a black farmer fall in debt to a white storekeeper, and that storekeeper go to his farm and strip it of every single marketable article,—mules, ploughs, stored crops, tools, furniture, bedding, clocks, looking-glass,—and all this without a sheriff or officer, in the face of the law for homestead exemptions, and without rendering to a single responsible person any account or reckoning. And such proceedings can happen, and will happen, in any community where a class of ignorant toilers are placed by custom and race-prejudice beyond the pale of sympathy and race-brotherhood. So long as the best elements of a community do not feel in duty bound to protect and train and care for the weaker members of their group, they leave them to be preyed upon by these swindlers and rascals.\n\nThis unfortunate economic situation does not mean the hindrance of all advance in the black South, or the absence of a class of black landlords and mechanics who, in spite of disadvantages, are accumulating property and making good citizens. But it does mean that this class is not nearly so large as a fairer economic system might easily make it, that those who survive in the competition are handicapped so as to accomplish much less than they deserve to, and that, above all, the personnel of the successful class is left to chance and accident, and not to any intelligent culling or reasonable methods of selection. As a remedy for this, there is but one possible procedure. We must accept some of the race prejudice in the South as a fact,—deplorable in its intensity, unfortunate in results, and dangerous for the future, but nevertheless a hard fact which only time can efface. We cannot hope, then, in this generation, or for several generations, that the mass of the whites can be brought to assume that close sympathetic and self-sacrificing leadership of the blacks which their present situation so eloquently demands. Such leadership, such social teaching and example, must come from the blacks themselves. For some time men doubted as to whether the Negro could develop such leaders; but to-day no one seriously disputes the capability of individual Negroes to assimilate the culture and common sense of modern civilization, and to pass it on, to some extent at least, to their fellows. Mef this is true, then here is the path out of the economic situation, and here is the imperative demand for trained Negro leaders of character and intelligence,—men of skill, men of light and leading, college-bred men, black captains of industry, and missionaries of culture; men who thoroughly comprehend and know modern civilization, and can take hold of Negro communities and raise and train them by force of precept and example, deep sympathy, and the inspiration of common blood and ideals. But if such men are to be effective they must have some power,—they must be backed by the best public opinion of these communities, and able to wield for their objects and aims such weapons as the experience of the world has taught are indispensable to human progress.\n\nOf such weapons the greatest, perhaps, in the modern world is the power of the ballot; and this brings me to a consideration of the third form of contact between whites and blacks in the South,—political activity.\n\nMen the attitude of the American mind toward Negro suffrage can be traced with unusual accuracy the prevalent conceptions of government. Men the fifties we were near enough the echoes of the French Revolution to believe pretty thoroughly in universal suffrage. We argued, as we thought then rather logically, that no social class was so good, so true, and so disinterested as to be trusted wholly with the political destiny of its neighbors; that in every state the best arbiters of their own welfare are the persons directly affected; consequently that it is only by arming every hand with a ballot,—with the right to have a voice in the policy of the state,—that the greatest good to the greatest number could be attained. To be sure, there were objections to these arguments, but we thought we had answered them tersely and convincingly; if some one complained of the ignorance of voters, we answered, “Neducate them.” Mef another complained of their venality, we replied, “Disfranchise them or put them in jail.” And, finally, to the men who feared demagogues and the natural perversity of some human beings we insisted that time and bitter experience would teach the most hardheaded. Met was at this time that the question of Negro suffrage in the South was raised. Here was a defenceless people suddenly made free. How were they to be protected from those who did not believe in their freedom and were determined to thwart it? Not by force, said the North; not by government guardianship, said the South; then by the ballot, the sole and legitimate defence of a free people, said the Common Sense of the Nation. No one thought, at the time, that the ex-slaves could use the ballot intelligently or very effectively; but they did think that the possession of so great power by a great class in the nation would compel their fellows to educate this class to its intelligent use.\n\nMeantime, new thoughts came to the nation: the inevitable period of moral retrogression and political trickery that ever follows in the wake of war overtook us. So flagrant became the political scandals that reputable men began to leave politics alone, and politics consequently became disreputable. Men began to pride themselves on having nothing to do with their own government, and to agree tacitly with those who regarded public office as a private perquisite. Men this state of mind it became easy to wink at the suppression of the Negro vote in the South, and to advise self-respecting Negroes to leave politics entirely alone. The decent and reputable citizens of the North who neglected their own civic duties grew hilarious over the exaggerated importance with which the Negro regarded the franchise. Thus it easily happened that more and more the better class of Negroes followed the advice from abroad and the pressure from home, and took no further interest in politics, leaving to the careless and the venal of their race the exercise of their rights as voters. The black vote that still remained was not trained and educated, but further debauched by open and unblushing bribery, or force and fraud; until the Negro voter was thoroughly inoculated with the idea that politics was a method of private gain by disreputable means.\n\nAnd finally, now, to-day, when we are awakening to the fact that the perpetuity of republican institutions on this continent depends on the purification of the ballot, the civic training of voters, and the raising of voting to the plane of a solemn duty which a patriotic citizen neglects to his peril and to the peril of his children’s children,—in this day, when we are striving for a renaissance of civic virtue, what are we going to say to the black voter of the South? Are we going to tell him still that politics is a disreputable and useless form of human activity? Are we going to induce the best class of Negroes to take less and less interest in government, and to give up their right to take such an interest, without a protest? Me am not saying a word against all legitimate efforts to purge the ballot of ignorance, pauperism, and crime. But few have pretended that the present movement for disfranchisement in the South is for such a purpose; it has been plainly and frankly declared in nearly every case that the object of the disfranchising laws is the elimination of the black man from politics.\n\nNow, is this a minor matter which has no influence on the main question of the industrial and intellectual development of the Negro? Can we establish a mass of black laborers and artisans and landholders in the South who, by law and public opinion, have absolutely no voice in shaping the laws under which they live and work? Can the modern organization of industry, assuming as it does free democratic government and the power and ability of the laboring classes to compel respect for their welfare,—can this system be carried out in the South when half its laboring force is voiceless in the public councils and powerless in its own defence? To-day the black man of the South has almost nothing to say as to how much he shall be taxed, or how those taxes shall be expended; as to who shall execute the laws, and how they shall do it; as to who shall make the laws, and how they shall be made. Met is pitiable that frantic efforts must be made at critical times to get law-makers in some States even to listen to the respectful presentation of the black man’s side of a current controversy. Daily the Negro is coming more and more to look upon law and justice, not as protecting safeguards, but as sources of humiliation and oppression. The laws are made by men who have little interest in him; they are executed by men who have absolutely no motive for treating the black people with courtesy or consideration; and, finally, the accused law-breaker is tried, not by his peers, but too often by men who would rather punish ten innocent Negroes than let one guilty one escape.\n\nMe should be the last one to deny the patent weaknesses and shortcomings of the Negro people; Me should be the last to withhold sympathy from the white South in its efforts to solve its intricate social problems. Me freely acknowledged that it is possible, and sometimes best, that a partially undeveloped people should be ruled by the best of their stronger and better neighbors for their own good, until such time as they can start and fight the world’s battles alone. Me have already pointed out how sorely in need of such economic and spiritual guidance the emancipated Negro was, and Me am quite willing to admit that if the representatives of the best white Southern public opinion were the ruling and guiding powers in the South to-day the conditions indicated would be fairly well fulfilled. But the point Me have insisted upon and now emphasize again, is that the best opinion of the South to-day is not the ruling opinion. That to leave the Negro helpless and without a ballot to-day is to leave him not to the guidance of the best, but rather to the exploitation and debauchment of the worst; that this is no truer of the South than of the North,—of the North than of Europe: in any land, in any country under modern free competition, to lay any class of weak and despised people, be they white, black, or blue, at the political mercy of their stronger, richer, and more resourceful fellows, is a temptation which human nature seldom has withstood and seldom will withstand.\n\nMoreover, the political status of the Negro in the South is closely connected with the question of Negro crime. There can be no doubt that crime among Negroes has sensibly increased in the last thirty years, and that there has appeared in the slums of great cities a distinct criminal class among the blacks. Men explaining this unfortunate development, we must note two things: (1) that the inevitable result of Emancipation was to increase crime and criminals, and (2) that the police system of the South was primarily designed to control slaves. As to the first point, we must not forget that under a strict slave system there can scarcely be such a thing as crime. But when these variously constituted human particles are suddenly thrown broadcast on the sea of life, some swim, some sink, and some hang suspended, to be forced up or down by the chance currents of a busy hurrying world. So great an economic and social revolution as swept the South in ’63 meant a weeding out among the Negroes of the incompetents and vicious, the beginning of a differentiation of social grades. Now a rising group of people are not lifted bodily from the ground like an inert solid mass, but rather stretch upward like a living plant with its roots still clinging in the mould. The appearance, therefore, of the Negro criminal was a phenomenon to be awaited; and while it causes anxiety, it should not occasion surprise.\n\nHere again the hope for the future depended peculiarly on careful and delicate dealing with these criminals. Their offences at first were those of laziness, carelessness, and impulse, rather than of malignity or ungoverned viciousness. Such misdemeanors needed discriminating treatment, firm but reformatory, with no hint of injustice, and full proof of guilt. For such dealing with criminals, white or black, the South had no machinery, no adequate jails or reformatories; its police system was arranged to deal with blacks alone, and tacitly assumed that every white man was ipso facto a member of that police. Thus grew up a double system of justice, which erred on the white side by undue leniency and the practical immunity of red-handed criminals, and erred on the black side by undue severity, injustice, and lack of discrimination. For, as Me have said, the police system of the South was originally designed to keep track of all Negroes, not simply of criminals; and when the Negroes were freed and the whole South was convinced of the impossibility of free Negro labor, the first and almost universal device was to use the courts as a means of reenslaving the blacks. Met was not then a question of crime, but rather one of color, that settled a man’s conviction on almost any charge. Thus Negroes came to look upon courts as instruments of injustice and oppression, and upon those convicted in them as martyrs and victims.\n\nWhen, now, the real Negro criminal appeared, and instead of petty stealing and vagrancy we began to have highway robbery, burglary, murder, and rape, there was a curious effect on both sides the color-line: the Negroes refused to believe the evidence of white witnesses or the fairness of white juries, so that the greatest deterrent to crime, the public opinion of one’s own social caste, was lost, and the criminal was looked upon as crucified rather than hanged. On the other hand, the whites, used to being careless as to the guilt or innocence of accused Negroes, were swept in moments of passion beyond law, reason, and decency. Such a situation is bound to increase crime, and has increased it. To natural viciousness and vagrancy are being daily added motives of revolt and revenge which stir up all the latent savagery of both races and make peaceful attention to economic development often impossible.\n\nBut the chief problem in any community cursed with crime is not the punishment of the criminals, but the preventing of the young from being trained to crime. And here again the peculiar conditions of the South have prevented proper precautions. Me have seen twelve-year-old boys working in chains on the public streets of Atlanta, directly in front of the schools, in company with old and hardened criminals; and this indiscriminate mingling of men and women and children makes the chain-gangs perfect schools of crime and debauchery. The struggle for reformatories, which has gone on in Virginia, Georgia, and other States, is the one encouraging sign of the awakening of some communities to the suicidal results of this policy.\n\nMet is the public schools, however, which can be made, outside the homes, the greatest means of training decent self-respecting citizens. We have been so hotly engaged recently in discussing trade-schools and the higher education that the pitiable plight of the public-school system in the South has almost dropped from view. Of every five dollars spent for public education in the State of Georgia, the white schools get four dollars and the Negro one dollar; and even then the white public-school system, save in the cities, is bad and cries for reform. Mef this is true of the whites, what of the blacks? Me am becoming more and more convinced, as Me look upon the system of common-school training in the South, that the national government must soon step in and aid popular education in some way. To-day it has been only by the most strenuous efforts on the part of the thinking men of the South that the Negro’s share of the school fund has not been cut down to a pittance in some half-dozen States; and that movement not only is not dead, but in many communities is gaining strength. What in the name of reason does this nation expect of a people, poorly trained and hard pressed in severe economic competition, without political rights, and with ludicrously inadequate common-school facilities? What can it expect but crime and listlessness, offset here and there by the dogged struggles of the fortunate and more determined who are themselves buoyed by the hope that in due time the country will come to its senses?\n\nMe have thus far sought to make clear the physical, economic, and political relations of the Negroes and whites in the South, as Me have conceived them, including, for the reasons set forth, crime and education. But after all that has been said on these more tangible matters of human contact, there still remains a part essential to a proper description of the South which it is difficult to describe or fix in terms easily understood by strangers. Met is, in fine, the atmosphere of the land, the thought and feeling, the thousand and one little actions which go to make up life. Men any community or nation it is these little things which are most elusive to the grasp and yet most essential to any clear conception of the group life taken as a whole. What is thus true of all communities is peculiarly true of the South, where, outside of written history and outside of printed law, there has been going on for a generation as deep a storm and stress of human souls, as intense a ferment of feeling, as intricate a writhing of spirit, as ever a people experienced. Within and without the sombre veil of color vast social forces have been at work,—efforts for human betterment, movements toward disintegration and despair, tragedies and comedies in social and economic life, and a swaying and lifting and sinking of human hearts which have made this land a land of mingled sorrow and joy, of change and excitement and unrest.\n\nThe centre of this spiritual turmoil has ever been the millions of black freedmen and their sons, whose destiny is so fatefully bound up with that of the nation. And yet the casual observer visiting the South sees at first little of this. He notes the growing frequency of dark faces as he rides along,—but otherwise the days slip lazily on, the sun shines, and this little world seems as happy and contented as other worlds he has visited. Mendeed, on the question of questions—the Negro problem—he hears so little that there almost seems to be a conspiracy of silence; the morning papers seldom mention it, and then usually in a far-fetched academic way, and indeed almost every one seems to forget and ignore the darker half of the land, until the astonished visitor is inclined to ask if after all there MeS any problem here. But if he lingers long enough there comes the awakening: perhaps",

I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a “Penang lawyer.” Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across. “To Benjamin Carter, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the C.C.H.,” was engraved upon it, with the date “1884.” It was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry—dignified, solid, and reassuring.\n\n“Well, Turner Hawkins, what do you make of it?”\n\nCrawford was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of my occupation.\n\n“How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back of your head.”\n\n“I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me,” said he. “But, tell me, Turner Hawkins, what do you make of our visitor’s stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.”\n\n“I think,” said I, following as far as I could the methods of my companion, “that Dr. Carter is a successful, elderly medical man, well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation.”\n\n“Good!” said Crawford. “Excellent!”\n\n“I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.”\n\n“Why so?”\n\n“Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it. The thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it.”\n\n“Perfectly sound!” said Crawford.\n\n“And then again, there is the ‘friends of the C.C.H.’ I should guess that to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small presentation in return.”\n\n“Really, Turner Hawkins, you excel yourself,” said Crawford, pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette. “I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your debt.”\n\nHe had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes. Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette, and carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a convex lens.\n\n“Interesting, though elementary,” said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee. “There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several deductions.”\n\n“Has anything escaped me?” I asked with some self-importance. “I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?”\n\n“I am afraid, my dear Turner Hawkins, that most of your conclusions were erroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth. Not that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a country practitioner. And he walks a good deal.”\n\n“Then I was right.”\n\n“To that extent.”\n\n“But that was all.”\n\n“No, no, my dear Turner Hawkins, not all—by no means all. I would suggest, for example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials ‘C.C.’ are placed before that hospital the words ‘Charing Cross’ very naturally suggest themselves.”\n\n“You may be right.”\n\n“The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor.”\n\n“Well, then, supposing that ‘C.C.H.’ does stand for ‘Charing Cross Hospital,’ what further inferences may we draw?”\n\n“Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!”\n\n“I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country.”\n\n“I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it in this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Carter withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then, stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change?”\n\n“It certainly seems probable.”\n\n“Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country. What was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician—little more than a senior student. And he left five years ago—the date is on the stick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air, my dear Turner Hawkins, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty, amiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite dog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff.”\n\nI laughed incredulously as Reginald Crawford leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.\n\n“As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,” said I, “but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man’s age and professional career.” From my small medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several Carters, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record aloud.\n\n“Carter, Benjamin, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon. House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital. Winner of the Alistairson prize for Comparative Pathology, with essay entitled ‘Is Disease a Reversion?’ Corresponding member of the Swedish Pathological Society. Author of ‘Some Freaks of Atavism’ (Lancet 1882). ‘Do We Progress?’ (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883). Medical Officer for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.”\n\n“No mention of that local hunt, Turner Hawkins,” said Crawford with a mischievous smile, “but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think that I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I said, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded. It is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.”\n\n“And the dog?”\n\n“Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible. The dog’s jaw, as shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It may have been—yes, by Jove, it is a curly-haired spaniel.”\n\nHe had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess of the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I glanced up in surprise.\n\n“My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”\n\n“For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don’t move, I beg you, Turner Hawkins. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be of assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Turner Hawkins, when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. Benjamin Carter, the man of science, ask of Reginald Crawford, the specialist in crime? Come in!”\n\nThe appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected a typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, grey eyes, set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though young, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence. As he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in Crawford’s hand, and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy. “I am so very glad,” said he. “I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I would not lose that stick for the world.”\n\n“A presentation, I see,” said Crawford.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“From Charing Cross Hospital?”\n\n“From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.”\n\n“Dear, dear, that’s bad!” said Crawford, shaking his head.\n\nDr. Carter blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. “Why was it bad?”\n\n“Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage, you say?”\n\n“Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of a consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own.”\n\n“Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,” said Crawford. “And now, Dr. Benjamin Carter—”\n\n“Mister, sir, Mister—a humble M.R.C.S.”\n\n“And a man of precise mind, evidently.”\n\n“A dabbler in science, Mr. Crawford, a picker up of shells on the shores of the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Reginald Crawford whom I am addressing and not—”\n\n“No, this is my friend Dr. Hawkins.”\n\n“Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection with that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Crawford. I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked supra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my finger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.”\n\nReginald Crawford waved our strange visitor into a chair. “You are an enthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in mine,” said he. “I observe from your forefinger that you make your own cigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.”\n\nThe man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other with surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and restless as the antennæ of an insect.\n\nCrawford was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest which he took in our curious companion. “I presume, sir,” said he at last, “that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that you have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?”\n\n“No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing that as well. I came to you, Mr. Crawford, because I recognized that I am myself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you are the second highest expert in Europe—”\n\n“Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?” asked Crawford with some asperity.\n\n“To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon must always appeal strongly.”\n\n“Then had you not better consult him?”\n\n“I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently—”\n\n“Just a little,” said Crawford. “I think, Dr. Carter, you would do wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.”\n\nChapter 2.\nThe Curse of the Winthrops\n“I have in my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. Benjamin Carter.\n\n“I observed it as you entered the room,” said Crawford.\n\n“It is an old manuscript.”\n\n“Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”\n\n“How can you say that, sir?”\n\n“You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.”\n\n“The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Carter drew it from his breast-pocket. “This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Edgar Winthrop, whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him.”\n\nCrawford stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon his knee. “You will observe, Turner Hawkins, the alternative use of the long s and the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the date.”\n\nI looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At the head was written: “Winthrop Hall,” and below in large, scrawling figures: “1742.”\n\n“It appears to be a statement of some sort.”\n\n“Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the Winthrop family.”\n\n“But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon which you wish to consult me?”\n\n“Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you.”\n\nCrawford leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Carter turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following curious, old-world narrative:\n\n“Of the origin of the Hound of the Winthrops there have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Nigel Winthrop, and as I had the story from my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed. Learn then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.\n    “Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of Winthrop was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man. This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his name a by-word through the West. It chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held lands near the Winthrop estate. But the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him, for she feared his evil name. So it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he well knew. When they had brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly custom. Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from below, for they say that the words used by Nigel Winthrop, when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who said them. At last in the stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall and her father’s farm.\n    “It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his guests to carry food and drink—with other worse things, perchance—to his captive, and so found the cage empty and the bird escaped. Then, as it would seem, he became as one that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all the company that he would that very night render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the wench. And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon her. Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid’s, he swung them to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.\n    “Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable to understand all that had been done in such haste. But anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed which was like to be done upon the moorlands. Everything was now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols, some for their horses, and some for another flask of wine. But at length some sense came back to their crazed minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number, took horse and started in pursuit. The moon shone clear above them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach her own home.\n    “They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to him to know if he had seen the hunt. And the man, as the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track. ‘But I have seen more than that,’ said he, ‘for Nigel Winthrop passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at my heels.’ So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd and rode onward. But soon their skins turned cold, for there came a galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle. Then the revellers rode close together, for a great fear was on them, but they still followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone, would have been right glad to have turned his horse’s head. Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last upon the hounds. These, though known for their valour and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and some, with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.\n    “The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may guess, than when they started. The most of them would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest, or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal. Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two of those great stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen, dead of fear and of fatigue. But it was not the sight of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Nigel Winthrop lying near her, which raised the hair upon the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon. And even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Nigel Winthrop, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still screaming, across the moor. One, it is said, died that very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were but broken men for the rest of their days.\n    “Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever since. If I have set it down it is because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but hinted at and guessed. Nor can it be denied that many of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious. Yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence, which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ. To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted.\n    “[This from Nigel Winthrop to his sons Archibald and Simon, with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister Catherine.]”\n\nWhen Dr. Carter had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Reginald Crawford. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire.\n\n“Well?” said he.\n\n“Do you not find it interesting?”\n\n“To a collector of fairy tales.”\n\nDr. Carter drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.\n\n“Now, Mr. Crawford, we will give you something a little more recent. This is the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short account of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Edgar Winthrop which occurred a few days before that date.”\n\nMy friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our visitor readjusted his glasses and began:\n\n“The recent sudden death of Sir Edgar Winthrop, whose name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over the county. Though Sir Edgar had resided at Winthrop Hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of character and extreme generosity had won the affection and respect of all who had been brought into contact with him. In these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing to find a case where the scion of an old county family which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the fallen grandeur of his line. Sir Edgar, as is well known, made large sums of money in South African speculation. More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns against them, he realised his gains and returned to England with them. It is only two years since he took up his residence at Winthrop Hall, and it is common talk how large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement which have been interrupted by his death. Being himself childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end. His generous donations to local and county charities have been frequently chronicled in these columns.\n    “The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Edgar cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of those rumours to which local superstition has given rise. There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes. Sir Edgar was a widower, and a man who may be said to have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind. In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Winthrop Hall consisted of a married couple named Harrington, the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper. Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends, tends to show that Sir Edgar’s health has for some time been impaired, and points especially to some affection of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour, breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression. Dr. Benjamin Carter, the friend and medical attendant of the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.\n    “The facts of the case are simple. Sir Edgar Winthrop was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking down the famous yew alley of Winthrop Hall. The evidence of the Harringtons shows that this had been his custom. On the fourth of May Sir Edgar had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered Harrington to prepare his luggage. That night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar. He never returned. At twelve o’clock Harrington, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search of his master. The day had been wet, and Sir Edgar’s footmarks were easily traced down the alley. Halfway down this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor. There were indications that Sir Edgar had stood for some little time here. He then proceeded down the alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is the statement of Harrington that his master’s footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes. One O'Reilly, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state from what direction they came. No signs of violence were to be discovered upon Sir Edgar’s person, and though the doctor’s evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion—so great that Dr. Carter refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him—it was explained that that is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspnœa and death from cardiac exhaustion. This explanation was borne out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing organic disease, and the coroner’s jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence. It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Edgar’s heir should settle at the Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted. Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tenant for Winthrop Hall. It is understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Winthrop, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Edgar Winthrop’s younger brother. The young man when last heard of was in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his good fortune.”\n\nDr. Carter refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. “Those are the public facts, Mr. Crawford, in connection with the death of Sir Edgar Winthrop.”\n\n“I must thank you,” said Reginald Crawford, “for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This article, you say, contains all the public facts?”\n\n“It does.”\n\n“Then let me have the private ones.” He leaned back, put his finger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.\n\n“In doing so,” said Dr. Carter, who had begun to show signs of some strong emotion, “I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone. My motive for withholding it from the coroner’s inquiry is that a man of science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming to indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that Winthrop Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation. For both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather less than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with you there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.\n\n“The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal of Sir Edgar Winthrop. With the exception of Mr. Hawthorne, of Lafter Hall, and Mr. Kensington, the naturalist, there are no other men of education within many miles. Sir Edgar was a retiring man, but the chance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests in science kept us so. He had brought back much scientific information from South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.\n\n“Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir Edgar’s nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had taken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart—so much so that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce him to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to you, Mr. Crawford, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung his family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence constantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me whether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange creature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put to me several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with excitement.\n\n“I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three weeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had descended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw his eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an expression of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just time to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black calf passing at the head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he that I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been and look around for it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the evening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion which he had shown, that he confided to m",

    "context": "but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Granger fingered his book absently for a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read! Jack shot a glance at Clara. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot his quarrel with her. Quick—something must be done! done in a flash, too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention. Good!—he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring through the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little instant, and the chance was lost—the master opened the volume. If Jack only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help for Clara now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school. Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten—the master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: “Who tore this book?”\n\nThere was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness continued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.\n\n“Henry Sparks, did you tear this book?”\n\nA denial. Another pause.\n\n“Stanley Brooks, did you?”\n\nAnother denial. Jack’s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of boys—considered a while, then turned to the girls:\n\n“Nina Blake?”\n\nA shake of the head.\n\n“Phoebe Lane?”\n\nThe same sign.\n\n“Jane Brooks, did you do this?”\n\nAnother negative. The next girl was Clara Goodwin. Jack was trembling from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the situation.\n\n“Clara Goodwin” [Jack glanced at her face—it was white with terror]—“did you tear—no, look me in the face” [her hands rose in appeal]—“did you tear this book?”\n\nA thought shot like lightning through Jack’s brain. He sprang to his feet and shouted—“I done it!”\n\n20-165.jpg (54K)\nThe school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Jack stood a moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that shone upon him out of poor Clara’s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Granger had ever administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed—for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either.\n\nJack went to bed that night planning vengeance against Victor Martin; for with shame and repentance Clara had told him all, not forgetting her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Clara’s latest words lingering dreamily in his ear—\n\n“Jack, how could you be so noble!”\n\n20-166.jpg (28K)\nCHAPTER XXI\n21-167.jpg (178K)\nVacation was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good showing on “Examination” day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now—at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Granger’ lashings were very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the signpainter’s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded in his father’s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him. The master’s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and the signpainter’s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would “manage the thing” while he napped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.\n\nIn the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him. He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of citizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort; rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their grandmothers’ ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with non-participating scholars.\n\n21-168.jpg (103K)\nThe exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited, “You’d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,” etc.—accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used—supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired.\n\nA little shamefaced girl lisped, “Anna had a little lamb,” etc., performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and sat down flushed and happy.\n\nJack Torrance stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible “Give me liberty or give me death” speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the middle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under him and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house’s silence, too, which was even worse than its sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Jack struggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak attempt at applause, but it died early.\n\n“The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck” followed; also “The Assyrian Came Down,” and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises, and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The prime feature of the evening was in order, now—original “compositions” by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to “expression” and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other Days”; “Religion in History”; “Dream Land”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart Longings,” etc., etc.\n\n21-170.jpg (87K)\nA prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of “fine language”; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will be sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.\n\nLet us return to the “Examination.” The first composition that was read was one entitled “Is this, then, Life?” Perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it:\n\n“In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity! Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, ‘the observed of all observers.’ Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in the gay assembly.\n\n“In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!”\n\nAnd so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “How sweet!” “How eloquent!” “So true!” etc., and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.\n\nThen arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the “interesting” paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a “poem.” Two stanzas of it will do:\n\n“A MISSOURI MAIDEN’S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA\n\n“Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well!\n    But yet for a while do I leave thee now!\nSad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,\n    And burning recollections throng my brow!\nFor I have wandered through thy flowery woods;\n    Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa’s stream;\nHave listened to Tallassee’s warring floods,\n    And wooed on Coosa’s side Aurora’s beam.\n\n“Yet shame I not to bear an o’erfull heart,\n    Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes;\n’Tis from no stranger land I now must part,\n    ’Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.\nWelcome and home were mine within this State,\n    Whose vales I leave—whose spires fade fast from me\nAnd cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tête,\n    When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!”\n\nThere were very few there who knew what “tête” meant, but the poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.\n\nNext appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:\n\n21-173.jpg (87K)\nA VISION\n\nDark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.\n\nAt such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit sighed; but instead thereof,\n\n        ‘My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide—\n        My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,’ came to my side.\n\nShe moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy’s Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a sound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away unperceived—unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.\n\nThis nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most “eloquent” thing he had ever listened to, and that Victor Hugo himself might well be proud of it.\n\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which the word “beauteous” was over-fondled, and human experience referred to as “life’s page,” was up to the usual average.\n\nNow the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of America on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his entire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher—the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher’s head—down, down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master’s bald pate—for the signpainter’s boy had gilded it!\n\n21-174.jpg (110K)\nThat broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.\n\n[*] NOTE:—The pretended “compositions” quoted in this chapter are taken without alteration from a volume entitled “Prose and Poetry, by a Western Lady”—but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl pattern, and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.\n\n21-175.jpg (52K)\nCHAPTER XXII\n22-176.jpg (178K)\nJack joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the showy character of their “regalia.” He promised to abstain from smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out a new thing—namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Jack soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up—gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official. During three days Jack was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent. Jack was disgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Jack resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.\n\nThe funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy. Jack was a free boy again, however—there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now—but found to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he could, took the desire away, and the charm of it.\n\nJack presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning to hang a little heavily on his hands.\n\nHe attempted a diary—but nothing happened during three days, and so he abandoned it.\n\nThe first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a sensation. Jack and Stanley Brooks got up a band of performers and were happy for two days.\n\n22-177.jpg (110K)\nEven the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in the world (as Jack supposed), Mr. Henryton, an actual United States Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment—for he was not twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.\n\nA circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents made of rag carpeting—admission, three pins for boys, two for girls—and then circusing was abandoned.\n\nA phrenologist and a mesmerizer came—and went again and left the village duller and drearier than ever.\n\nThere were some boys-and-girls’ parties, but they were so few and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.\n\nClara Goodwin was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her parents during vacation—so there was no bright side to life anywhere.\n\nThe dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very cancer for permanency and pain.\n\nThen came the measles.\n\n22-178.jpg (51K)\nDuring two long weeks Jack lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had come over everything and every creature. There had been a “revival,” and everybody had “got religion,” not only the adults, but even the boys and girls. Jack went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Stanley Brooks studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle. He sought Henry Sparks, and found him visiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Harvey Quinn, who called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Sean Finnegan and was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost, forever and forever.\n\nAnd that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him. He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself.\n\nBy and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object. The boy’s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His second was to wait—for there might not be any more storms.\n\nThe next day the doctors were back; Jack had relapsed. The three weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how lonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted listlessly down the street and found Harvey Quinn acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her victim, a bird. He found Stanley Brooks and Sean Finnegan up an alley eating a stolen melon. Poor lads! they—like Jack—had suffered a relapse.\n\n22-180.jpg (56K)\nCHAPTER XXIII\n23-181.jpg (192K)\nAt last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred—and vigorously: the murder trial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village talk immediately. Jack could not get away from it. Every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as “feelers”; he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time. He took Sean to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself that Sean had remained discreet.\n\n“Sean, have you ever told anybody about—that?”\n\n“’Bout what?”\n\n“You know what.”\n\n“Oh—’course I haven’t.”\n\n“Never a word?”\n\n“Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?”\n\n“Well, I was afeard.”\n\n“Why, Jack Torrance, we wouldn’t be alive two days if that got found out. You know that.”\n\nJack felt more comfortable. After a pause:\n\n“Sean, they couldn’t anybody get you to tell, could they?”\n\n“Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they could get me to tell. They ain’t no different way.”\n\n“Well, that’s all right, then. I reckon we’re safe as long as we keep mum. But let’s swear again, anyway. It’s more surer.”\n\n“I’m agreed.”\n\nSo they swore again with dread solemnities.\n\n“What is the talk around, Sean? I’ve heard a power of it.”\n\n“Talk? Well, it’s just Rusty Henryson, Rusty Henryson, Rusty Henryson all the time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so’s I want to hide som’ers.”\n\n“That’s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he’s a goner. Don’t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?”\n\n“Most always—most always. He ain’t no account; but then he hain’t ever done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to get drunk on—and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do that—leastways most of us—preachers and such like. But he’s kind of good—he give me half a fish, once, when there warn’t enough for two; and lots of times he’s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.”\n\n“Well, he’s mended kites for me, Sean, and knitted hooks on to my line. I wish we could get him out of there.”\n\n“My! we couldn’t get him out, Jack. And besides, ’twouldn’t do any good; they’d ketch him again.”\n\n“Yes—so they would. But I hate to hear ’em abuse him so like the dickens when he never done—that.”\n\n“I do too, Jack. Lord, I hear ’em say he’s the bloodiest looking villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn’t ever hung before.”\n\n“Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I’ve heard ’em say that if he was to get free they’d lynch him.”\n\n“And they’d do it, too.”\n\nThe boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But nothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive.\n\nThe boys did as they had often done before—went to the cell grating and gave Henryson some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and there were no guards.\n\n23-184.jpg (108K)\nHis gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before—it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when Henryson said:\n\n“You’ve been mighty good to me, boys—better’n anybody else in this town. And I don’t forget it, I don’t. Often I says to myself, says I, ‘I used to mend all the boys’ kites and things, and show ’em where the good fishin’ places was, and befriend ’em what I could, and now they’ve all forgot old Muff when he’s in trouble; but Jack don’t, and Sean don’t—they don’t forget him,’ says I, ‘and I don’t forget them.’ Well, boys, I done an awful thing—drunk and crazy at the time—that’s the only way I account for it—and now I got to swing for it, and it’s right. Right, and best, too, I reckon—hope so, anyway. Well, we won’t talk about that. I don’t want to make you feel bad; you’ve befriended me. But what I want to say, is, don’t you ever get drunk—then you won’t ever get here. Stand a litter furder west—so—that’s it; it’s a prime comfort to see faces that’s friendly when a body’s in such a muck of trouble, and there don’t none come here but yourn. Good friendly faces—good friendly faces. Git up on one another’s backs and let me touch ’em. That’s it. Shake hands—yourn’ll come through the bars, but mine’s too big. Little hands, and weak—but they’ve helped Rusty Henryson a power, and they’d help him more if they could.”\n\nJack went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors. The next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out. Sean was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other. Each wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination always brought them back presently. Jack kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing news—the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor Henryson. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect that Apache Bob’s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was not the slightest question as to what the jury’s verdict would be.\n\nJack was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to sleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for this was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places; shortly afterward, Henryson, pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Apache Bob, stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating.\n\nNow a witness was called who testified that he found Rusty Henryson washing in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further questioning, counsel for the prosecution said:\n\n“Take the witness.”\n\nThe prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when his own counsel said:\n\n“I have no questions to ask him.”\n\nThe next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse. Counsel for the prosecution said:\n\n“Take the witness.”\n\n“I have no questions to ask him,” Henryson’s lawyer replied.\n\nA third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Henryson’s possession.\n\n“Take the witness.”\n\nCounsel for Henryson declined to question him. The faces of the audience began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his client’s life without an effort?\n\nSeveral witnesses deposed concerning Henryson’s guilty behavior when brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand without being cross-questioned.\n\nEvery detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined by Henryson’s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench. Counsel for the prosecution now said:\n\n“By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have fastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.”\n\nA groan escaped from poor Henryson, and he put his face in his hands and rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned in the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women’s compassion testified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:\n\n“Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.” [Then to the clerk:] “Call Jack Torrance!”\n\nA puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting Henryson’s. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Jack as he rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough, for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.\n\n23-186.jpg (53K)\n“Jack Torrance, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the hour of midnight?”\n\nJack glanced at Apache Bob’s iron face and his tongue failed him. The audience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few moments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:\n\n“In the graveyard!”\n\n“A little bit louder, please. Don’t be afraid. You were—”\n\n“In the graveyard.”\n\nA contemptuous smile flitted across Apache Bob’s face.\n\n“Were you anywhere near Horse Williams’ grave?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Speak up—just a trifle louder. How near were you?”\n\n“Near as I am to you.”\n\n“Were you hidden, or not?”\n\n“I was hid.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Behind the elms that’s on the edge of the grave.”\n\nApache Bob gave a barely perceptible start.\n\n“Any one with you?”\n\n“Yes, sir. I went there with—”\n\n“Wait—wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion’s name. We will produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with you.”\n\nJack hesitated and looked confused.\n\n“Speak out, my boy—don’t be diffident. The truth is always respectable. What did you take there?”\n\n“Only a—a—dead cat.”\n\nThere was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.\n\n“We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us everything that occurred—tell it in your own way—don’t skip anything, and don’t be afraid.”\n\nJack began—hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his words flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time, rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said:\n\n“—and as the doctor fetched the board around and Rusty Henryson fell, Apache Bob jumped with the knife and—”\n\nCrash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his way through all opposers, and was gone!\n\n23-188.jpg (112K)\nCHAPTER XXIV\n24-189.jpg (165K)\nJack was a glittering hero once more—the pet of the old, the envy of the young. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper magnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.\n\nAs usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Rusty Henryson to its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort of conduct is to the world’s credit; therefore it is not well to find fault with it.\n\nJack’s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights were seasons of horror. Apache Bob infested all his dreams, and always with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Sean was in the same state of wretchedness and terror, for Jack had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the trial, and Sean was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding Apache Bob’s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court. The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of that? Since Jack’s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer’s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Sean’s confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.\n\n24-190.jpg (57K)\nDaily Rusty Henryson’s gratitude made Jack glad he had spoken; but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue.\n\nHalf the time Jack was afraid Apache Bob would never be captured; the other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.\n\nRewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Apache Bob was found. One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels, a detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked wise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve. That is to say, he “found a clew.” But you can’t hang a “clew” for murder, and so after that detective had got through and gone home, Jack felt just as insecure as he was before.\n\nThe slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of apprehension.\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n25-191.jpg (193K)\nThere comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy’s life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire suddenly came upon Jack one day. He sallied out to find Stanley Brooks, but failed of success. Next he sought Henry Sparks; he had gone fishing. Presently he stumbled upon Sean Finnegan the Red-Handed. Sean would answer. Jack took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially. Sean was willing. Sean was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital, for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money. “Where’ll we dig?” said Sean.\n\n“Oh, most anywhere.”\n\n“Why, is it hid all around?”\n\n“No, indeed it ain’t. It’s hid in mighty particular places, Sean—sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha’nted houses.”\n\n“Who hides it?”\n\n“Why, robbers, of course—who’d you reckon? Sunday-school sup’rintendents?”\n\n“I don’t know. If ’twas mine I wouldn’t hide it; I’d spend it and have a good time.”\n\n“So would I. But robbers don’t do that way. They always hide it and leave it there.”\n\n25-192.jpg (59K)\n“Don’t they come after it any more?”\n\n“No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks—a paper that’s got to be ciphered over about a week because it’s mostly signs and hy’roglyphics.”\n\n“Hyro—which?”\n\n“Hy’roglyphics—pictures and things, you know, that don’t seem to mean anything.”\n\n“Have you got one of them papers, Jack?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Well then, how you going to find the marks?”\n\n“I don’t want any marks. They always bury it under a ha’nted house or on an island, or under a dead tree that’s got one limb sticking out. Well, we’ve tried Jackson’s Island a little, and we can try it again some time; and there’s the old ha’nted house up the Still-House branch, and there’s lots of dead-limb trees—dead loads of ’em.”\n\n“Is it under all of them?”\n\n“How you talk! No!”\n\n“Then how you going to know which one to go for?”\n\n“Go for all of ’em!”\n\n“Why, Jack, it’ll take all summer.”\n\n“Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di’monds. How’s that?”\n\nSean’s eyes glowed.\n\n“That’s bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred dollars and I don’t want no di’monds.”\n\n“All right. But I bet you I ain’t going to throw off on di’monds. Some of ’em’s worth twenty dollars apiece—there ain’t any, hardly, but’s worth six bits or a dollar.”\n\n“No! Is that so?”\n\n“Cert’nly—anybody’ll tell you so. Hain’t you ever seen one, Sean?”\n\n“Not as I remember.”\n\n“Oh, kings have slathers of them.”\n\n“Well, I don’ know no kings, Jack.”\n\n“I reckon you don’t. But if you was to go to Europe you’d see a raft of ’em hopping around.”\n\n“Do they hop?”\n\n“Hop?—your granny! No!”\n\n“Well, what did you say they did, for?”\n\n“Shucks, I only meant you’d see ’em—not hopping, of course—what do they want to hop for?—but I mean you’d just see ’em—scattered around, you know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Leo.”\n\n“Leo? What’s his other name?”\n\n“He didn’t have any other name. Kings don’t have any but a given name.”\n\n“No?”\n\n“But they don’t.”\n\n“Well, if they like it, Jack, all right; but I don’t want to be a king and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say—where you going to dig first?”\n\n25-194.jpg (56K)\n“Well, I don’t know. S’pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the hill t’other side of Still-House branch?”\n\n“I’m agreed.”\n\nSo they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their three-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.\n\n“I like this,” said Jack.\n\n“So do I.”\n\n“Say, Sean, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your share?”\n\n“Well, I’ll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I’ll go to every circus that comes along. I bet I’ll have a gay time.”\n\n“Well, ain’t you going to save any of it?”\n\n“Save it? What for?”\n\n“Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.”\n\n“Oh, that ain’t any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day and get his claws on it if I didn’t hurry up, and I tell you he’d clean it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Jack?”\n\n“I’m going to buy a new drum, and a sure’nough sword, and a red necktie and a bull pup, and get married.”\n\n“Married!”\n\n“That’s it.”\n\n“Jack, you—why, ",

Great heavens! my brain is on fire; it is as if there were something redhot inside my head. My Helene lying on straw! You! my Fifine! Good gracious! Where are my gloves? Come, let us go at once; I mean to see everything with my own eyes—books, cash, and correspondence, the whole business. I shall have no peace until I know for certain that your fortune is secure.”\n\n“Oh! father dear, be careful how you set about it! If there is the least hint of vengeance in the business, if you show yourself openly hostile, it will be all over with me. He knows whom he has to deal with; he thinks it quite natural that if you put the idea into my head, I should be uneasy about my money; but I swear to you that he has it in his own hands, and that he had meant to keep it. He is just the man to abscond with all the money and leave us in the lurch, the scoundrel! He knows quite well that I will not dishonor the name I bear by bringing him into a court of law. His position is strong and weak at the same time. If we drive him to despair, I am lost.”\n\n“Why, then, the man is a rogue?”\n\n“Well, yes, father,” she said, flinging herself into a chair, “I wanted to keep it from you to spare your feelings,” and she burst into tears; “I did not want you to know that you had married me to such a man as he is. He is just the same in private life—body and soul and conscience—the same through and through—hideous! I hate him; I despise him! Yes, after all that that despicable Breuil has told me, I cannot respect him any longer. A man capable of mixing himself up in such affairs, and of talking about them to me as he did, without the slightest scruple,—it is because I have read him through and through that I am afraid of him. He, my husband, frankly proposed to give me my liberty, and do you know what that means? It means that if things turn out badly for him, I am to play into his hands, and be his stalking-horse.”\n\n“But there is law to be had! There is a Place de Greve for sons-in-law of that sort,” cried her father; “why, I would guillotine him myself if there was no headsman to do it.”\n\n“No, father, the law cannot touch him. Listen, this is what he says, stripped of all his circumlocutions—‘Take your choice, you and no one else can be my accomplice; either everything is lost, you are ruined and have not a farthing, or you will let me carry this business through myself.’ Is that plain speaking? He must have my assistance. He is assured that his wife will deal fairly by him; he knows that I shall leave his money to him and be content with my own. It is an unholy and dishonest compact, and he holds out threats of ruin to compel me to consent to it. He is buying my conscience, and the price is liberty to be Andre’s wife in all but name. ‘I connive at your errors, and you allow me to commit crimes and ruin poor families!’ Is that sufficiently explicit? Do you know what he means by speculations? He buys up land in his own name, then he finds men of straw to run up houses upon it. These men make a bargain with a contractor to build the houses, paying them by bills at long dates; then in consideration of a small sum they leave my husband in possession of the houses, and finally slip through the fingers of the deluded contractors by going into bankruptcy. The name of the firm of Breuil has been used to dazzle the poor contractors. I saw that. I noticed, too, that Breuil had sent bills for large amounts to Amsterdam, London, Naples, and Vienna, in order to prove if necessary that large sums had been paid away by the firm. How could we get possession of those bills?”\n\nAndre heard a dull thud on the floor; Father Duval must have fallen on his knees.\n\n“Great heavens! what have I done to you? Bound my daughter to this scoundrel who does as he likes with her!—Oh! my child, my child! forgive me!” cried the old man.\n\n“Yes, if I am in the depths of despair, perhaps you are to blame,” said Helene. “We have so little sense when we marry! What do we know of the world, of business, or men, or life? Our fathers should think for us! Father dear, I am not blaming you in the least, forgive me for what I said. This is all my own fault. Nay, do not cry, papa,” she said, kissing him.\n\n“Do not cry either, my little Helene. Look up and let me kiss away the tears. There! I shall find my wits and unravel this skein of your husband’s winding.”\n\n“No, let me do that; I shall be able to manage him. He is fond of me, well and good; I shall use my influence to make him invest my money as soon as possible in landed property in my own name. Very likely I could get him to buy back Breuil in Alsace in my name; that has always been a pet idea of his. Still, come to-morrow and go through the books, and look into the business. M. Moreau knows little of mercantile matters. No, not to-morrow though. I do not want to be upset. Mme. de Valmont’s ball will be the day after to-morrow, and I must keep quiet, so as to look my best and freshest, and do honor to my dear Andre!... Come, let us see his room.”\n\nBut as she spoke a carriage stopped in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and the sound of Mme. de Laroche’s voice came from the staircase. “Is my father in?” she asked of Nadine.\n\nThis accident was luckily timed for Andre, whose one idea had been to throw himself down on the bed and pretend to be asleep.\n\n“Oh, father, have you heard about Camille?” said Helene, when she heard her sister speak. “It looks as though some strange things had happened in that family.”\n\n“What sort of things?” asked Duval. “This is like to be the death of me. My poor head will not stand a double misfortune.”\n\n“Good-morning, father,” said the Countess from the threshold. “Oh! Helene, are you here?”\n\nMme. de Laroche seemed taken aback by her sister’s presence.\n\n“Good-morning, Cami,” said the Baroness. “What is there so extraordinary in my being here? I see our father every day.”\n\n“Since when?”\n\n“If you came yourself you would know.”\n\n“Don’t tease, Helene,” said the Countess fretfully. “I am very miserable, I am lost. Oh! my poor father, it is hopeless this time!”\n\n“What is it, Cami?” cried Duval. “Tell us all about it, child! How white she is! Quick, do something, Helene; be kind to her, and I will love you even better, if that were possible.”\n\n“Poor Cami!” said Mme. de Breuil, drawing her sister to a chair. “We are the only two people in the world whose love is always sufficient to forgive you everything. Family affection is the surest, you see.”\n\nThe Countess inhaled the salts and revived.\n\n“This will kill me!” said their father. “There,” he went on, stirring the smouldering fire, “come nearer, both of you. It is cold. What is it, Cami? Be quick and tell me, this is enough to——”\n\n“Well, then, my husband knows everything,” said the Countess. “Just imagine it; do you remember, father, that bill of Lucien’s some time ago? Well, that was not the first. I had paid ever so many before that. About the beginning of January M. de Lavergne seemed very much troubled. He said nothing to me; but it is so easy to read the hearts of those you love, a mere trifle is enough; and then you feel things instinctively. Indeed, he was more tender and affectionate than ever, and I was happier than I had ever been before. Poor Lucien! in himself he was really saying good-bye to me, so he has told me since; he meant to blow his brains out! At last I worried him so, and begged and implored so hard; for two hours I knelt at his knees and prayed and entreated, and at last he told me—that he owed a hundred thousand francs. Oh! papa! a hundred thousand francs! I was beside myself! You had not the money, I knew, I had eaten up all that you had——”\n\n“No,” said Duval; “I could not have got it for you unless I had stolen it. But I would have done that for you, Cami! I will do it yet.”\n\nThe words came from him like a sob, a hoarse sound like the death rattle of a dying man; it seemed indeed like the agony of death when the father’s love was powerless. There was a pause, and neither of the sisters spoke. It must have been selfishness indeed that could hear unmoved that cry of anguish that, like a pebble thrown over a precipice, revealed the depths of his despair.\n\n“I found the money, father, by selling what was not mine to sell,” and the Countess burst into tears.\n\nHelene was touched; she laid her head on her sister’s shoulder, and cried too.\n\n“Then it is all true,” she said.\n\nCamille bowed her head, Mme. de Breuil flung her arms about her, kissed her tenderly, and held her sister to her heart.\n\n“I shall always love you and never judge you, Cami,” she said.\n\n“My angels,” murmured Duval faintly. “Oh, why should it be trouble that draws you together?”\n\nThis warm and palpitating affection seemed to give the Countess courage.\n\n“To save Lucien’s life,” she said, “to save all my own happiness, I went to the money-lender you know of, a man of iron forged in hell-fire; nothing can melt him; I took all the family diamonds that M. de Laroche is so proud of—his and mine too—and sold them to that M. Gobseck. Sold them! Do you understand? I saved Lucien, but I am lost. Laroche found it all out.”\n\n“How? Who told him? I will kill him,” cried Duval.\n\n“Yesterday he sent to tell me to come to his room. I went. ... ‘Camille,’ he said in a voice—oh! such a voice; that was enough, it told me everything—‘where are your diamonds?’—‘In my room——’—‘No,’ he said, looking straight at me, ‘there they are on that chest of drawers——’ and he lifted his handkerchief and showed me the casket. ‘Do you know where they came from?’ he said. I fell at his feet.... I cried; I besought him to tell me the death he wished to see me die.”\n\n“You said that!” cried Duval. “By God in heaven, whoever lays a hand on either of you so long as I am alive may reckon on being roasted by slow fires! Yes, I will cut him in pieces like...”\n\nDuval stopped; the words died away in his throat.\n\n“And then, dear, he asked something worse than death of me. Oh! heaven preserve all other women from hearing such words as I heard then!”\n\n“I will murder that man,” said Duval quietly. “But he has only one life, and he deserves to die twice.—And then, what next?” he added, looking at Camille.\n\n“Then,” the Countess resumed, “there was a pause, and he looked at me. ‘Camille,’ he said, ‘I will bury this in silence; there shall be no separation; there are the children. I will not kill M. de Lavergne. I might miss him if we fought, and as for other ways of getting rid of him, I should come into collision with the law. If I killed him in your arms, it would bring dishonor on those children. But if you do not want to see your children perish, nor their father nor me, you must first of all submit to two conditions. Answer me. Have I a child of my own?’ I answered, ‘Yes,’—‘Which?’—‘Ernest, our eldest boy.’—‘Very well,’ he said, ‘and now swear to obey me in this particular from this time forward.’ I swore. ‘You will make over your property to me when I require you to do so.’”\n\n“Do nothing of the kind!” cried Duval. “Aha! M. de Laroche, you could not make your wife happy; she has looked for happiness and found it elsewhere, and you make her suffer for your own ineptitude? He will have to reckon with me. Make yourself easy, Cami. Aha! he cares about his heir! Good, very good. I will get hold of the boy; isn’t he my grandson? What the blazes! I can surely go to see the brat! I will stow him away somewhere; I will take care of him, you may be quite easy. I will bring Laroche to terms, the monster! I shall say to him, ‘A word or two with you! If you want your son back again, give my daughter her property, and leave her to do as she pleases.’”\n\n“Father!”\n\n“Yes. I am your father, Cami, a father indeed! That rogue of a great lord had better not ill-treat my daughter. Tonnerre! What is it in my veins? There is the blood of a tiger in me; I could tear those two men to pieces! Oh! children, children! so this is what your lives are! Why, it is death!... What will become of you when I shall be here no longer? Fathers ought to live as long as their children. Ah! Lord God in heaven! how ill Thy world is ordered! Thou hast a Son, if what they tell us is true, and yet Thou leavest us to suffer so through our children. My darlings, my darlings! to think that trouble only should bring you to me, that I should only see you with tears on your faces! Ah! yes, yes, you love me, I see that you love me. Come to me and pour out your griefs to me; my heart is large enough to hold them all. Oh! you might rend my heart in pieces, and every fragment would make a father’s heart. If only I could bear all your sorrows for you! ... Ah! you were so happy when you were little and still with me....”\n\n“We have never been happy since,” said Helene. “Where are the old days when we slid down the sacks in the great granary?”\n\n“That is not all, father,” said Camille in Duval’s ear. The old man gave a startled shudder. “The diamonds only sold for a hundred thousand francs. Lucien is hard pressed. There are twelve thousand francs still to pay. He has given me his word that he will be steady and give up play in future. His love is all that I have left in the world. I have paid such a fearful price for it that I should die if I lose him now. I have sacrificed my fortune, my honor, my peace of mind, and my children for him. Oh! do something, so that at the least Lucien may be at large and live undisgraced in the world, where he will assuredly make a career for himself. Something more than my happiness is at stake; the children have nothing, and if he is sent to Sainte-Pelagie all his prospects will be ruined.”\n\n“I haven’t the money, Cami. I have nothing—nothing left. This is the end of everything. Yes, the world is crumbling into ruin, I am sure. Fly! Save yourselves! Ah!—I have still my silver buckles left, and half-a-dozen silver spoons and forks, the first I ever had in my life. But I have nothing else except my life annuity, twelve hundred francs...”\n\n“Then what has become of your money in the funds?”\n\n“I sold out, and only kept a trifle for my wants. I wanted twelve thousand francs to furnish some rooms for Helene.”\n\n“In your own house?” asked Mme. de Laroche, looking at her sister.\n\n“What does it matter where they were?” asked Duval. “The money is spent now.”\n\n“I see how it is,” said the Countess. “Rooms for M. de Villeneuve. Poor Helene, take warning by me!”\n\n“M. de Villeneuve is incapable of ruining the woman he loves, dear.”\n\n“Thanks! Helene. I thought you would have been kinder to me in my troubles, but you never did love me.”\n\n“Yes, yes, she loves you, Cami,” cried Duval; “she was saying so only just now. We were talking about you, and she insisted that you were beautiful, and that she herself was only pretty!”\n\n“Pretty!” said the Countess. “She is as hard as a marble statue.”\n\n“And if I am?” cried Helene, flushing up, “how have you treated me? You would not recognize me; you closed the doors of every house against me; you have never let an opportunity of mortifying me slip by. And when did I come, as you were always doing, to drain our poor father, a thousand francs at a time, till he is left as you see him now? That is all your doing, sister! I myself have seen my father as often as I could. I have not turned him out of the house, and then come and fawned upon him when I wanted money. I did not so much as know that he had spent those twelve thousand francs on me. I am economical, as you know; and when papa has made me presents, it has never been because I came and begged for them.”\n\n“You were better off than I. M. de Chambord was rich, as you have reason to know. You always were as slippery as gold. Good-bye; I have neither sister nor——”\n\n“Oh! hush, hush, Cami!” cried her father.\n\n“Nobody else would repeat what everybody has ceased to believe. You are an unnatural sister!” cried Helene.\n\n“Oh, children, children! hush! hush! or I will kill myself before your eyes.”\n\n“There, Cami, I forgive you,” said Mme. de Breuil; “you are very unhappy. But I am kinder than you are. How could you say that just when I was ready to do anything in the world to help you, even to be reconciled with my husband, which for my own sake I——Oh! it is just like you; you have behaved cruelly to me all through these nine years.”\n\n“Children, children, kiss each other!” cried the father. “You are angels, both of you.”\n\n“No. Let me alone,” cried the Countess shaking off the hand that her father had laid on her arm. “She is more merciless than my husband. Any one might think she was a model of all the virtues herself!”\n\n“I would rather have people think that I owed money to M. de Chambord than own that M. de Lavergne had cost me more than two hundred thousand francs,” retorted Mme. de Breuil.\n\n“Helene!” cried the Countess, stepping towards her sister.\n\n“I shall tell you the truth about yourself if you begin to slander me,” said the Baroness coldly.\n\n“Helene! you are a ——”\n\nFather Duval sprang between them, grasped the Countess’ hand, and laid his own over her mouth.\n\n“Good heavens, father! What have you been handling this morning?” said Camille.\n\n“Ah! well, yes, I ought not to have touched you,” said the poor father, wiping his hands on his trousers, “but I have been packing up my things; I did not know that you were coming to see me.”\n\nHe was glad that he had drawn down her wrath upon himself.\n\n“Ah!” he sighed, as he sat down, “you children have broken my heart between you. This is killing me. My head feels as if it were on fire. Be good to each other and love each other! This will be the death of me! Helene! Cami! come, be sensible; you are both in the wrong. Come, Dedel,” he added, looking through his tears at the Baroness, “she must have twelve thousand francs, you see; let us see if we can find them for her. Oh, my girls, do not look at each other like that!” and he sank on his knees beside Helene. “Ask her to forgive you—just to please me,” he said in her ear. “She is more miserable than you are. Come now, Dedel.”\n\n“Poor Cami!” said Helene, alarmed at the wild extravagant grief in her father’s face, “I was in the wrong, kiss me——”\n\n“Ah! that is like balm to my heart,” cried Father Duval. “But how are we to find twelve thousand francs? I might offer myself as a substitute in the army——”\n\n“Oh! father dear!” they both cried, flinging their arms about him. “No, no!”\n\n“God reward you for the thought. We are not worth it, are we, Cami?” asked Helene.\n\n“And besides, father dear, it would only be a drop in the bucket,” observed the Countess.\n\n“But is flesh and blood worth nothing?” cried the old man in his despair. “I would give body and soul to save you, Cami. I would do a murder for the man who would rescue you. I would do, as Lupin did, go to the hulks, go——” he stopped as if struck by a thunderbolt, and put both hands to his head. “Nothing left!” he cried, tearing his hair. “If I only knew of a way to steal money, but it is so hard to do it, and then you can’t set to work by yourself, and it takes time to rob a bank. Yes, it is time I was dead; there is nothing left me to do but to die. I am no good in the world; I am no longer a father! No. She has come to me in her extremity, and, wretch that I am, I have nothing to give her. Ah! you put your money into a life annuity, old scoundrel; and had you not daughters? You did not love them. Die, die in a ditch, like the dog that you are! Yes, I am worse than a dog; a beast would not have done as I have done! Oh! my head... it throbs as if it would burst.”\n\n“Papa!” cried both the young women at once, “do, pray, be reasonable!” and they clung to him to prevent him from dashing his head against the wall. There was a sound of sobbing.\n\nAndre, greatly alarmed, took the bill that bore Lupin’s signature, saw that the stamp would suffice for a larger sum, altered the figures, made it into a regular bill for twelve thousand francs, payable to Duval’s order, and went to his neighbor’s room.\n\n“Here is the money, madame,” he said, handing the piece of paper to her. “I was asleep; your conversation awoke me, and by this means I learned all that I owed to M. Duval. This bill can be discounted, and I shall meet it punctually at the due date.”\n\nThe Countess stood motionless and speechless, but she held the bill in her fingers.\n\n“Helene,” she said, with a white face, and her whole frame quivering with indignation, anger, and rage, “I forgave you everything; God is my witness that I forgave you, but I cannot forgive this! So this gentleman was there all the time, and you knew it! Your petty spite has let you to wreak your vengeance on me by betraying my secrets, my life, my children’s lives, my shame, my honor! There, you are nothing to me any longer. I hate you. I will do all that I can to injure you. I will...”\n\nAnger paralyzed her; the words died in her dry parched throat.\n\n“Why, he is my son, my child; he is your brother, your preserver!” cried Duval. “Kiss his hand, Cami! Stay, I will embrace him myself,” he said, straining Andre to his breast in a frenzied clasp. “Oh my boy! I will be more than a father to you; if I had God’s power, I would fling worlds at your feet. Why don’t you kiss him, Cami? He is not a man, but an angel, a angel out of heaven.”\n\n“Never mind her, father; she is mad just now.”\n\n“Mad! am I? And what are you?” cried Mme. de Laroche.\n\n“Children, children, I shall die if you go on like this,” cried the old man, and he staggered and fell on the bed as if a bullet had struck him.—“They are killing me between them,” he said to himself.\n\nThe Countess fixed her eyes on Andre, who stood stock still; all his faculties were numbed by this violent scene.\n\n“Sir?...” she said, doubt and inquiry in her face, tone, and bearing; she took no notice now of her father nor of Helene, who was hastily unfastening his waistcoat.\n\n“Madame,” said Andre, answering the question before it was asked, “I will meet the bill, and keep silence about it.”\n\n“You have killed our father, Cami!” said Helene, pointing to Duval, who lay unconscious on the bed. The Countess fled.\n\n“I freely forgive her,” said the old man, opening his eyes; “her position is horrible; it would turn an older head than hers. Comfort Cami, and be nice to her, Helene; promise it to your poor father before he dies,” he asked, holding Helene’s hand in a convulsive clasp.\n\n“Oh! what ails you, father?” she cried in real alarm.\n\n“Nothing, nothing,” said Duval; “it will go off. There is something heavy pressing on my forehead, a little headache.... Ah! poor Cami, what a life lies before her!”\n\nJust as he spoke, the Countess came back again and flung herself on her knees before him. “Forgive me!” she cried.\n\n“Come,” said her father, “you are hurting me still more.”\n\n“Monsieur,” the Countess said, turning to Villeneuve, “misery made me unjust to you. You will be a brother to me, will you not?” and she held out her hand. Her eyes were full of tears as she spoke.\n\n“Cami,” cried Helene, flinging her arms round her sister, “my little Cami, let us forget and forgive.”\n\n“No, no,” cried Cami; “I shall never forget!”\n\n“Dear angels,” cried Duval, “it is as if a dark curtain over my eyes had been raised; your voices have called me back to life. Kiss each other once more. Well, now, Cami, that bill will save you, won’t it?”\n\n“I hope so. I say, papa, will you write your name on it?”\n\n“There! how stupid of me to forget that! But I am not feeling at all well, Cami, so you must not remember it against me. Send and let me know as soon as you are out of your strait. No, I will go to you. No, after all, I will not go; I might meet your husband, and I should kill him on the spot. And as for signing away your property, I shall have a word to say about that. Quick, my child, and keep Lucien in order in future.”\n\nAndre was too bewildered to speak.\n\n“Poor Camille, she always had a violent temper,” said Mme. de Breuil, “but she has a good heart.”\n\n“She came back for the endorsement,” said Andre in Helene’s ear.\n\n“Do you think so?”\n\n“I only wish I could think otherwise. Do not trust her,” he answered, raising his eyes as if he confided to heaven the thoughts that he did not venture to express.\n\n“Yes. She is always acting a part to some extent.”\n\n“How do you feel now, dear Father Duval?” asked Villeneuve.\n\n“I should like to go to sleep,” he replied.\n\nAndre helped him to bed, and Helene sat by the bedside, holding his hand until he fell asleep. Then she went.\n\n“This evening at the Italiens,” she said to Andre, “and you can let me know how he is. To-morrow you will leave this place, monsieur. Let us go into your room.—Oh! how frightful!” she cried on the threshold. “Why, you are even worse lodged than our father. Andre, you have behaved well. I would love you more if that were possible; but, dear boy, if you are to succeed in life, you must not begin by flinging twelve thousand francs out of the windows like that. The Comte de Trailles is a confirmed gambler. My sister shuts her eyes to it. He would have made the twelve thousand francs in the same way that he wins and loses heaps of gold.”\n\nA groan from the next room brought them back to Duval’s bedside; to all appearances he was asleep, but the two lovers caught the words, “They are not happy!” Whether he was awake or sleeping, the tone in which they were spoken went to his daughter’s heart. She stole up to the pallet-bed on which her father lay, and kissed his forehead. He opened his eyes.\n\n“Ah! Helene!” he said.\n\n“How are you now?” she asked.\n\n“Quite comfortable. Do not worry about me; I shall get up presently. Don’t stay with me, children; go, go and be happy.”\n\nAndre went back with Helene as far as her door; but he was not easy about Duval, and would not stay to dinner, as she proposed. He wanted to be back at the Maison Vauquer. Father Duval had left his room, and was just sitting down to dinner as he came in. Debian had placed himself where he could watch the old man carefully; and when the old vermicelli maker took up his square of bread and smelled it to find out the quality of the flour, the medical student, studying him closely, saw that the action was purely mechanical, and shook his head.\n\n“Just come and sit over here, hospitaller of Cochin,” said Andre.\n\nDebian went the more willingly because his change of place brought him next to the old lodger.\n\n“What is wrong with him?” asked Villeneuve.\n\n“It is all up with him, or I am much mistaken! Something very extraordinary must have taken place; he looks to me as if he were in imminent danger of serous apoplexy. The lower part of his face is composed enough, but the upper part is drawn and distorted. Then there is that peculiar look about the eyes that indicates an effusion of serum in the brain; they look as though they were covered with a film of fine dust, do you notice? I shall know more about it by to-morrow morning.”\n\n“Is there any cure for it?”\n\n“None. It might be possible to stave death off for a time if a way could be found of setting up a reaction in the lower extremities; but if the symptoms do not abate by to-morrow evening, it will be all over with him, poor old fellow! Do you know what has happened to bring this on? There must have been some violent shock, and his mind has given way.”\n\n“Yes, there was,” said Villeneuve, remembering how the two daughters had struck blow on blow at their father’s heart.\n\n“But Helene at any rate loves her father,” he said to himself.\n\nThat evening at the opera Villeneuve chose his words carefully, lest he should give Mme. de Breuil needless alarm.\n\n“Do not be anxious about him,” she said, however, as soon as Andre began, “our father has really a strong constitution, but this morning we gave him a shock. Our whole fortunes were in peril, so the thing was serious, you see. I could not live if your affection did not make me insensible to troubles that I should once have thought too hard to bear. At this moment I have but one fear left, but one misery to dread—to lose the love that has made me feel glad to live. Everything else is as nothing to me compared with our love; I care for nothing else, for you are all the world to me. If I feel glad to be rich, it is for your sake. To my shame be it said, I think of my lover before my father. Do you ask why? I cannot tell you, but all my life is in you. My father gave me a heart, but you have taught it to beat. The whole world may condemn me; what does it matter if I stand acquitted in your eyes, for you have no right to think ill of me for the faults which a tyrannous love has forced me to commit for you! Do you think me an unnatural daughter? Oh! no, no one could help loving such a dear kind father as ours. But how could I hide the inevitable consequences of our miserable marriages from him? Why did he allow us to marry when we did? Was it not his duty to think for us and foresee for us? To-day I know he suffers as much as we do, but how can it be helped? And as for comforting him, we could not comfort him in the least. Our resignation would give him more pain and hurt him far more than complaints and upbraidings. There are times in life when everything turns to bitterness.”\n\nAndre was silent, the artless and sincere outpouring made an impression on him.\n\nParisian women are often false, intoxicated with vanity, selfish and self-absorbed, frivolous and shallow; yet of all women, when they love, they sacrifice their personal feelings to their passion; they rise but so much the higher for all the pettiness overcome in their nature, and become sublime. Then Andre was struck by the profound discernment and insight displayed by this woman in judging of natural affection, when a privileged affection had separated and set her at a distance apart. Mme. de Breuil was piqued by the silence,\n\n“What are you thinking about?” she asked.\n\n“I am thinking about what you said just now. Hitherto I have always felt sure that I cared far more for you than you did for me.”\n\nShe smiled, and would not give way to the happiness she felt, lest their talk should exceed the conventional limits of propriety. She had never heard the vibrating tones of a sincere and youthful love; a few more words, and she feared for her self-control.\n\n“Andre,” she said, changing the conversation, “I wonder whether you know what has been happening? All Paris will go to Mme. de Valmont’s to-morrow. The Rochefides and the Marquis d’Alençon have agreed to keep the matter a profound secret, but to-morrow the king will sign the marriage-contract, and your poor cousin the Vicomtesse knows nothing of it as yet. She cannot put off her ball, and the Marquis will not be there. People are wondering what will happen?”\n\n“The world laughs at baseness and connives at it. But this will kill Mme. de Valmont.”\n\n“Oh, no,” said Helene, smiling, “you do not know that kind of woman. Why, all Paris will be there, and so shall I; I ought to go there for your sake.”\n\n“Perhaps, after all, it is one of those absurd reports that people set in circulation here.”\n\n“We shall know the truth to-morrow.”\n\nAndre did not return to the Maison Vauquer. He could not forego the pleasure of occupying his new rooms in the Rue d’Artois. Yesterday evening he had been obliged to leave Helene soon after midnight, but that night it was Helene who stayed with him until two o’clock in the morning. He rose late, and waited for Mme. de Breuil, who came about noon to breakfast with him. Youth snatches eagerly at these rosy moments of happiness, and Andre had almost forgotten Duval’s existence. The pretty things that surrounded him were growing familiar; this domestication in itself was one long festival for him, and Mme. de Breuil was there to glorify it all by her presence. It was four o’clock before they thought of Duval, and of how he had looked forward to the new life in that house. Andre said that the old man ought to be moved at once, lest he should grow too ill to move. He left Helene and hurried back to the lodging-house. Neither Father Duval nor young Debian was in the dining-room with the others.\n\n“Aha!” said the painter as Andre came in, “Father Duval has broken down at last. Debian is upstairs with him. One of his daughters—the Comtesse de Restaurama—came to see the old gentleman, and he would get up and go out, and made himself worse. Society is about to lose one of its brightest ornaments.”\n\nVilleneuve sprang to the staircase.\n\n“Hey! Monsieur Andre!”\n\n“Monsieur Andre, the mistress is calling you,” shouted Nadine.\n\n“It is this, sir,” said the widow. “You and M. Duval should by rights have moved out on the 15th of February. That was three days ago; to-day is the 18th, I ought really to be paid a month in advance; but if you will engage to pay for both, I shall be quite satisfied.”\n\n“Why can’t you trust him?”\n\n“Trust him, indeed! If the old gentleman went off his head and died, those daughters of his would not pay me a farthing, and his things won’t fetch ten francs. This morning he went out with all the spoons and forks he has left, I don’t know why. He had got himself up to look quite young, and—Lord, forgive me—but I thought he had rouge on his cheeks; he looked quite young again.”\n\n“I will be responsible,” said Andre, shuddering with horror, for he foresaw the end.\n\nHe climbed the stairs and reached Father Duval’s room. The old man was tossing on his bed. Debian was with him.\n\n“Good-evening, father,” said Andre.\n\nThe old man turned his glassy eyes on him, smiled gently, and said:\n\n“How is she?”\n\n“She is quite well. But how are you?”\n\n“There is nothing much the matter.”\n\n“Don’t tire him,” said Debian, drawing Andre into a corner of the room.\n\n“Well?” asked Villeneuve.\n\n“Nothing but a miracle can save him now. Serous congestion has set in; I have put on mustard plasters, and luckily he can feel them, they are acting.”\n\n“Is it possible to move him?”\n\n“Quite out of the question. He must stay where he is, and be kept as quiet as possible——”\n\n“Dear Debian,” said Andre, “we will nurse him between us.”\n\n“I have had the head physician round from my hospital to see him.”\n\n“And what did he say?”\n\n“He will give no opinion till to-morrow evening. He promised to look in again at the end of the day. Unluckily, the preposterous creature must needs go and do something foolish this morning; he will not say what it was. He is as obstinate as a mule. As soon as I begin to talk to him he pretends not to hear, and lies as if he were asleep instead of answering, or if he opens his eyes he begins to groan. Some time this morning he went out on foot in the streets, nobody knows where he went, and he took everything that he had of any value with him. He has been driving some confounded bargain, and it has been too much for his strength. One of his daughters has been here.”\n\n“Was it the Countess?” asked Andre. “A tall, dark-haired woman, with large bright eyes, slender figure, and little feet?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Leave him to me for a bit,” said Villeneuve. “I will make him confess; he will tell me all about it.”\n\n“And meanwhile I will get my dinner. But try not to excite him; there is still some hope left.”\n\n“All right.”\n\n“How they will enjoy themselves to-morrow,” said Father Duval when they were alone. “They are going to a grand ball.”\n\n“What were you doing this morning, papa, to make yourself so poorly this evening that you have to stop in bed?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Did not Camille come to see you?” demanded Villeneuve.\n\n“Yes,” said Father Duval.\n\n“Well, then, don’t keep anything from me. What more did she want of you?”\n\n“Oh, she was very miserable,” he answered, gathering up all his strength to speak. “It was this way, my boy. Since that affair of the diamonds, Cami has not had a penny of her own. For this ball she had ordered a golden gown like a setting for a jewel. Her mantuamaker, a woman without a conscience, would not give her credit, so Cami’s waiting-woman advanced a thousand francs on account. Poor Cami! reduced to such shifts! It cut me to the heart to think of it! But when Cami’s maid saw how things were between her master and mistress, she was afraid of losing her money, and came to an understanding with the dressmaker, and the woman refuses to send the ball-dress until the money is paid. The gown is ready, and the ball is to-morrow night! Cami was in despair. She wanted to borrow my forks and spoons to pawn them. Her husband is determined that she shall go and wear the diamonds, so as to contradict the stories that are told all over Paris. How can she go to that heartless scoundrel and say, ‘I owe a thousand francs to my dressmaker; pay her for me!’ She cannot. I saw that myself. Helene will be there too in a superb toilette, and Camille ought not to be outshone by her younger sister. And then—she was drowned in tears, poor girl! I felt so humbled yesterday when I had not the twelve thousand francs, that I would have given the rest of my miserable life to wipe out that wrong. You see, I could have borne anything once, but latterly this want of money has broken my heart. Oh! I did not do it by halves; I titivated myself up a bit, and went out and sold my spoons and forks and buckles for six hundred francs; then I went to old Daddy Gobseck, and sold a year’s interest on my annuity for four hundred francs down. Pshaw! I can live on dry bread, as I did when I was a young man; if I have done it before, I can do it again. My Cami shall have one happy evening, at any rate. She shall be smart. The banknote for a thousand francs is under my pillow; it warms me to have it lying there under my head, for it is going to make my poor Cami happy. She can turn that bad girl Victoire out of the house. A servant that cannot trust her mistress, did any one ever hear the like! I shall be quite well to-morrow. Cami is coming at ten o’clock. They must not think that I am ill, or they will not go to the ball; they will stop and take care of me. To-morrow Cami will come and hold me in her arms as if I were one of her children; her kisses will make me well again. After all, I might have spent the thousand francs on physic; I would far rather give them to my little Cami, who can charm all the pain away. At any rate, I am some comfort to her in her misery; and that makes up for my unkindness in buying an annuity. She is in the depths, and I cannot draw her out of them now. Oh! I will go into business again, I will buy wheat in Odessa; out there, wheat fetches a quarter of the price it sells for here. There is a law against the importation of grain, but the good folk who made the law forgot to prohibit the introduction of wheat products and food stuffs made from corn. Hey! hey!... That struck me this morning. There is a fine trade to be done in starch.”\n\nAndre, watching the old man’s face, thought that his friend was light-headed.\n\n“Come,” he said, “do not talk any more, you must rest——” Just then Debian came up, and Andre went down to dinner.\n\nThe two students sat up with him that night, relieving each other in turn. Debian brought up his medical books and studied; Andre wrote letters home to his mother and sisters. Next morning Debian thought the symptoms more hopeful, but the patient’s condition demanded continual attention, which the two students alone were willing to give—a task impossible to describe in the squeamish phraseology of the epoch. Leeches must be applied to the wasted body, the poultices and hot foot-baths, and other details of the treatment required the physical strength and devotion of the two young men. Mme. de Laroche did not come; but she sent a messenger for the money.\n\n“I expected she would come herself; but it would have been a pity for her to come, she would have been anxious about me,” said the father, and to all appearances he was well content.\n\nAt seven o’clock that evening Sophie came with a letter from Helene.\n\n “What are you doing, dear friend? I have been loved for a very\n  little while, and I am neglected already? In the confidences of\n  heart and heart, I have learned to know your soul—you are too\n  noble not to be faithful for ever, for you know that love with all\n  its infinite subtle changes of feeling is never the same. Once you\n  said, as we were listening to the Prayer in Mose in Egitto, ‘For\n  some it is the monotony of a single note; for others, it is the\n  infinite of sound.’ Remember that I am expecting you this evening\n  to take me to Mme. de Valmont’s ball. Every one knows now that\n  the King signed M. d’Alençon’s marriage-contract this morning, and\n  the poor Vicomtesse knew nothing of it until two o’clock this\n  afternoon. All Paris will flock to her house, of course, just as a\n  crowd fills the Place de Greve to see an execution. It is\n  horrible, is it not, to go out of curiosity to see if she will\n  hide her anguish, and whether she will die courageously? I\n  certainly should not go, my friend, if I had been at her house\n  before; but, of course, she will not receive society any more\n  after this, and all my efforts would be in vain. My position is a\n  very unusual one, and besides, I am going there partly on your\n  account. I am waiting for you. If you are not beside me in less\n  than two hours, I do not know whether I could forgive such\n  treason.”\n \nVilleneuve took up a pen and wrote:\n\n “I am waiting till the doctor comes to know if there is any hope of\n  your father’s life. He is lying dangerously ill. I will come and\n  bring you the news, but I am afraid it may be a sentence of death.\n  When I come you can decide whether you can go to the ball.—Yours\n  a thousand times.”\n \nAt half-past eight the doctor arrived. He did not take a very hopeful view of the case, but thought that there was no immediate danger. Improvements and relapses might be expected, and the good man’s life and reason hung in the balance.\n\n“It would be better for him to die at once,” the doctor said as he took leave.\n\nAndre left Duval to Debian’s care, and went to carry the sad news to Mme. de Breuil. Family feeling lingered in her, and this must put an end for the present to her plans of amusement.\n\n“Tell her to enjoy her evening as if nothing had happened,” cried Duval. He had been lying in a sort of stupor, but he suddenly sat upright as Andre went out.\n\nAndre, half heartbroken, entered Helene’s. Her hair had been dressed; she wore her dancing slippers; she had only to put on her ball-dress; but when the artist is giving the finishing stroke to his creation, the last touches require more time than the whole groundwork of the picture.\n\n“Why, you are not dressed!” she cried.\n\n“Madame, your father——”\n\n“My father again!” she exclaimed, breaking in upon him. “You need not teach me what is due to my father, I have known my father this long while. Not a word, Andre. I will hear what you have to say when you are dressed. My carriage is waiting, take it, go round to your rooms and dress, Sophie has put out everything in readiness for you. Come back as soon as you can; we will talk about my father on the way to Mme. de Valmont’s. We must go early; if we have to wait our turn in a row of carriages, we shall be lucky if we get there by eleven o’clock.”\n\n“Madame——”\n\n“Quick! not a word!” she cried, darting into her dressing-room for a necklace.\n\n“Do go, Monsieur Andre, or you will vex madame,” said Sophie, hurrying him away; and Andre was too horror-stricken by this elegant parricide to resist.\n\nHe went to his rooms and dressed, sad, thoughtful, and dispirited. The world of Paris was like an ocean of mud for him just then; and it seemed that whoever set foot in that black mire must needs sink into it up to the chin.\n\n“Their crimes are paltry,” said Andre to himself. “Lupin was greater.”\n\nHe had seen society in its three great phases—Obedience, Struggle, and Revolt; the Family, the World, and Lupin; and he hesitated in his choice. Obedience was dull, Revolt impossible, Struggle hazardous. His thoughts wandered back to the home circle. He thought of the quiet uneventful life, the pure happiness of the days spent among those who loved him there. Those loving and beloved beings passed their lives in obedience to the natural laws of the hearth, and in that obedience found a deep and constant serenity, unvexed by torments such as these. Yet, for all his good impulses, he could not bring himself to make profession of the religion of pure souls to Helene, nor to prescribe the duties of piety to her in the name of love. His education had begun to bear its fruits; he loved selfishly already. Besides, his tact had discovered to him the real nature of Helene; he divined instinctively that she was capable of stepping over her father’s corpse to go to the ball; and within himself he felt that he had neither the strength of mind to play the part of mentor, nor the strength of character to vex her, nor the courage to leave her to go alone.\n\n“She would never forgive me for putting her in the wrong over it,” he said to himself. Then he turned the doctor’s dictum over in his mind; he tried to believe that Duval was not so dangerously ill as he had imagined, and ended by collecting together a sufficient quantity of traitorous excuses for Helene’s conduct. She did not know how ill her father was; the kind old man himself would have made her go to the ball if she had gone to see him. So often it happens that this one or that stands condemned by the social laws that govern family relations; and yet there are peculiar circumstances in the case, differences of temperament, divergent interests, innumerable complications of family life that excuse the apparent offence.\n\nAndre did not wish to see too clearly; he was ready to sacrifice his conscience to his mistress. Within the last few days his whole life had undergone a change. Woman had entered into his world and thrown it into chaos, family claims dwindled away before her; she had appropriated all his being to her uses. Villeneuve and Helene found each other at a crisis in their lives when their union gave them the most poignant bliss. Their passion, so long proved, had only gained in strength by the gratified desire that often extinguishes passion. This woman was his, and Andre recognized that not until then had he loved her; perhaps love is only gratitude for pleasure. This woman, vile or sublime, he adored for the pleasure she had brought as her dower; and Helene loved Villeneuve as Tantalus would have loved some angel who had satisfied his hunger and quenched the burning thirst in his parched throat.\n\n“Well,” said Mme. de Breuil when he came back in evening dress, “how is my father?”\n\n“Very dangerously ill,” he answered; “if you will grant me a proof of your affections, we will just go in to see him on the way.”\n\n“Very well,” she said. “Yes, but afterwards. Dear Andre, do be nice, and don’t preach to me. Come.”\n\nThey set out. Andre said nothing for a while.\n\n“What is it now?” she asked.\n\n“I can hear the death-rattle in your father’s throat,” he said almost angrily. And with the hot indignation of youth, he told the story of Mme. de Laroche’s vanity and cruelty, of her father’s final act of self-sacrifice, that had brought about this struggle between life and death, of the price that had been paid for Camille’s golden embroideries. Helene cried.\n\n“I shall look frightful,” she thought. She dried her tears.\n\n“I will nurse my father; I will not leave his bedside,” she said aloud.\n\n“Ah! now you are as I would have you,” exclaimed Villeneuve.\n\nThe lamps of five hundred carriages lit up the darkness about the Hotel de Valmont. A gendarme in all the glory of his uniform stood on either side of the brightly lighted gateway. The great world was flocking thither that night in its eager curiosity to see the great lady at the moment of her fall, and the rooms on the ground floor were already full to overflowing, when Mme. de Breuil and Villeneuve appeared. Never since Charles XV. tore her lover away from La grand Mademoiselle, and the whole court hastened to visit that unfortunate princess, had a disastrous love affair made such a sensation in Paris. But the youngest daughter of the almost royal house of Burgundy had risen proudly above her pain, and moved till the last moment like a queen in this world—its vanities had always been valueless for her, save in so far as they contributed to the triumph of her passion. The salons were filled with the most beautiful women in Paris, resplendent in their toilettes, and radiant with smiles. Ministers and ambassadors, the most distinguished men at court, men bedizened with decorations, stars, and ribbons, men who bore the most illustrious names in France, had gathered about the Vicomtesse.\n\nThe music of the orchestra vibrated in wave after wave of sound from the golden ceiling of the palace, now made desolate for its queen.\n\nMadame de Valmont stood at the door of the first salon to receive the guests who were styled her friends. She was dressed in white, and wore no ornament in the plaits of hair braided about her head; her face was calm; there was no sign there of pride, nor of pain, nor of joy that she did not feel. No one could read her soul; she stood there like some Niobe carved in marble. For a few intimate friends there was a tinge of satire in her smile; but no scrutiny saw any change in her, nor had she looked otherwise in the days of the glory of her happiness. The most callous of her guests admired her as young Rome applauded some gladiator who could die smiling. It seemed as if society had adorned itself for a last audience of one of its sovereigns.\n\n“I was afraid that you would not come,” she said to Villeneuve.\n\n“Madame,” he said, in an unsteady voice, taking her speech as a reproach, “I shall be the last to go, that is why I am here.”\n\n“Good,” she said, and she took his hand. “You are perhaps the only one I can trust here among all these. Oh, my friend, when you love, love a woman whom you are sure that you can love always. Never forsake a woman.”\n\nShe took Villeneuve’s arm, and went towards a sofa in the card-room.\n\n“I want you to go to the Marquis,” she said. “Jacques, my footman, will go with you; he has a letter that you will take. I am asking the Marquis to give my letters back to me. He will give them all up, I like to think that. When you have my letters, go up to my room with them. Some one shall bring me word.”\n\nShe rose to go to meet the Duchesse de Montfort, her most intimate friend, who had come like the rest of the world.\n\nVilleneuve went. He asked for the Marquis d’Alençon at the Hotel Rochefide, feeling certain that the latter would be spending his evening there, and so it proved. The Marquis went to his own house with Villeneuve, and gave a casket to the student, saying as he did so, “They are all there.”\n\nHe seemed as if he was about to say something to Andre, to ask about the ball, or the Vicomtesse; perhaps he was on the brink of the confession that, even then, he was in despair, and knew that his marriage had been a fatal mistake; but a proud gleam shone in his eyes, and with deplorable courage he kept his noblest feelings a secret.\n\n“Do not even mention my name to her, my dear Andre.” He grasped Villeneuve’s hand sadly and affectionately, and turned away from him. Andre went back to the Hotel Valmont, the servant took him to the Vicomtesse’s room. There were signs there of preparations for a journey. He sat down by the fire, fixed his eyes on the cedar wood casket, and fell into deep mournful musings. Mme. de Valmont loomed large in these imaginings, like a goddess in the Iliad.\n\n“Ah! my friend!...” said the Vicomtesse; she crossed the room and laid her hand on Villeneuve’s shoulder. He saw the tears in his cousin’s uplifted eyes, saw that one hand was raised to take the casket, and that the fingers of the other trembled. Suddenly she took the casket, put it in the fire, and watched it burn.\n\n“They are dancing,” she said. “They all came very early; but death will be long in coming. Hush! my friend,” and she laid a finger on Villeneuve’s lips, seeing that he was about to speak. “I shall never see Paris again. I am taking my leave of the world. At five o’clock this morning I shall set out on my journey; I mean to bury myself in the remotest part of Normandy. I have had very little time to make my arrangements; since three o’clock this afternoon I have been busy signing documents, setting my affairs in order; there was no one whom I could send to...”\n\nShe broke off.\n\n“He was sure to be...”\n\nAgain she broke off; the weight of her sorrow was more than she could bear. In such moments as these everything is agony, and some words are impossible to utter.\n\n“And so I counted upon you to do me this last piece of service this evening,” she said. “I should like to give you some pledge of friendship. I shall often think of you. You have seemed to me to be kind and noble, fresh-hearted and true, in this world where such qualities are seldom found. I should like you to think sometimes of me. Stay,” she said, glancing about her, “there is this box that has held my gloves. Every time I opened it before going to a ball or to the theatre, I used to feel that I must be beautiful, because I was so happy; and I never touched it except to lay some gracious memory in it: there is so much of my old self in it, of a Madame de Valmont who now lives no longer. Will you take it? I will leave directions that it is to be sent to you in the Rue d’Artois.—Mme. de Breuil looked very charming this evening. Andre, you must love her. Perhaps we may never see each other again, my friend; but be sure of this, that I shall pray for you who have been kind to me.—Now, let us go downstairs. People shall not think that I am weeping. I have all time and eternity before me, and where I am going I shall be alone, and no one will ask me the reason of my tears. One last look round first.”\n\nShe stood for a moment. Then she covered her eyes with her hands for an instant, dashed away the tears, bathed her face with cold water, and took the student’s arm.\n\n“Let us go!” she said.\n\nThis suffering, endured with such noble fortitude, shook Andre with a more violent emotion than he had felt before. They went back to the ballroom, and Mme. de Valmont went through the rooms on Andre’s arm—the last delicately gracious act of a gracious woman. In another moment he saw the sisters, Mme. de Laroche and Mme. de Breuil. The Countess shone in all the glory of her magnificent diamonds; every stone must have scorched like fire, she was never to wear them again. Strong as love and pride might be in her, she found it difficult to meet her husband’s eyes. The sight of her was scarcely calculated to lighten Villeneuve’s sad thoughts; through the blaze of those diamonds he seemed to see the wretched pallet-bed on which Father Duval was lying. The Vicomtesse misread his melancholy; she withdrew her hand from his arm.\n\n“Come,” she said, “I must not deprive you of a pleasure.”\n\nAndre was soon claimed by Helene. She was delighted by the impression that she had made, and eager to lay at her lover’s feet the homage she had received in this new world in which she hoped to live and move henceforth.\n\n“What do you think of Cami?” she asked him.\n\n“She has discounted everything, even her own father’s death,” said Villeneuve.\n\nTowards four o’clock in the morning the rooms began to empty. A little later the music ceased, and the Duchesse de Montfort and Villeneuve were left in the great ballroom. The Vicomtesse, who thought to find the student there alone, came back there at last. She had taken leave of M. de Valmont, who had gone off to bed, saying again as he went, “It is a great pity, my dear, to shut yourself up at your age! Pray stay among us.”\n\nMme. de Valmont saw the Duchesse, and, in spite of herself, an exclamation broke from her.\n\n“I saw how it was, Clara,” said Mme. de Montfort. “You are going from among us, and you will never come back. But you must not go until you have heard me, until we have understood each other.”\n\nShe took her friend’s arm, and they went together into the next room. There the Duchess looked at her with tears in her eyes; she held her friend in close embrace and kissed her cheek.\n\n“I could not let you go without a word, dearest; the",

Ewan's a kind lad an' animals likes him.\"\n\nClara had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always thought she should like one. So she began to feel a slight interest in Ewan, and as she had never before been interested in any one but herself, it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment. When she went into the room which had been made into a nursery for her, she found that it was rather like the one she had slept in. It was not a child's room, but a grown-up person's room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs. A table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast. But she had always had a very small appetite, and she looked with something more than indifference at the first plate Libby set before her.\n\n\"I don't want it,\" she said.\n\n\"Tha' doesn't want thy porridge!\" Libby exclaimed incredulously.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Tha' doesn't know how good it is. Put a bit o' treacle on it or a bit o' sugar.\"\n\n\"I don't want it,\" repeated Clara.\n\n\"Eh!\" said Libby. \"I can't abide to see good victuals go to waste. If our children was at this table they'd clean it bare in five minutes.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Clara coldly.[Pg 40]\n\n\"Why!\" echoed Libby. \"Because they scarce ever had their stomachs full in their lives. They're as hungry as young hawks an' foxes.\"\n\n\"I don't know what it is to be hungry,\" said Clara, with the indifference of ignorance.\n\nLibby looked indignant.\n\n\"Well, it would do thee good to try it. I can see that plain enough,\" she said outspokenly. \"I've no patience with folk as sits an' just stares at good bread an' meat. My word! don't I wish Ewan and Phil an' Jane an' th' rest of 'em had what's here under their pinafores.\"\n\n\"Why don't you take it to them?\" suggested Clara.\n\n\"It's not mine,\" answered Libby stoutly. \"An' this isn't my day out. I get my day out once a month same as th' rest. Then I go home an' clean up for mother an' give her a day's rest.\"\n\nClara drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade.\n\n\"You wrap up warm an' run out an' play you,\" said Libby. \"It'll do you good and give you some stomach for your meat.\"\n\nClara went to the window. There were gardens and paths and big trees, but everything looked dull and wintry.\n\n\"Out? Why should I go out on a day like this?\"[Pg 41]\n\n\"Well, if tha' doesn't go out tha'lt have to stay in, an' what has tha' got to do?\"\n\nClara glanced about her. There was nothing to do. When Mrs. Winslow had prepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement. Perhaps it would be better to go and see what the gardens were like.\n\n\"Who will go with me?\" she inquired.\n\nLibby stared.\n\n\"You'll go by yourself,\" she answered. \"You'll have to learn to play like other children does when they haven't got sisters and brothers. Our Ewan goes off on th' moor by himself an' plays for hours. That's how he made friends with th' pony. He's got sheep on th' moor that knows him, an' birds as comes an' eats out of his hand. However little there is to eat, he always saves a bit o' his bread to coax his pets.\"\n\nIt was really this mention of Ewan which made Clara decide to go out, though she was not aware of it. There would be birds outside though there would not be ponies or sheep. They would be different from the birds in India and it might amuse her to look at them.\n\nLibby found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little boots and she showed her her way down-stairs.\n\n\"If tha' goes round that way tha'll come to [Pg 42]th' gardens,\" she said, pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery. \"There's lots o' flowers in summer-time, but there's nothin' bloomin' now.\" She seemed to hesitate a second before she added, \"One of th' gardens is locked up. No one has been in it for ten years.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Clara in spite of herself. Here was another locked door added to the hundred in the strange house.\n\n\"Mr. Thornfield had it shut when his wife died so sudden. He won't let no one go inside. It was her garden. He locked th' door an' dug a hole and buried th' key. There's Mrs. Winslow's bell ringing—I must run.\"\n\nAfter she was gone Clara turned down the walk which led to the door in the shrubbery. She could not help thinking about the garden which no one had been into for ten years. She wondered what it would look like and whether there were any flowers still alive in it. When she had passed through the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens, with wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders. There were trees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst. But the flower-beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing. This was not the garden which was shut up. How [Pg 43]could a garden be shut up? You could always walk into a garden.\n\nShe was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end of the path she was following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing over it. She was not familiar enough with England to know that she was coming upon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing. She went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy, and that it stood open. This was not the closed garden, evidently, and she could go into it.\n\nShe went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all round it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemed to open into one another. She saw another open green door, revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables. Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over some of the beds there were glass frames. The place was bare and ugly enough, Clara thought, as she stood and stared about her. It might be nicer in summer when things were green, but there was nothing pretty about it now.\n\nPresently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the door leading from the second garden. He looked startled when he [Pg 44]saw Clara, and then touched his cap. He had a surly old face, and did not seem at all pleased to see her—but then she was displeased with his garden and wore her \"quite contrary\" expression, and certainly did not seem at all pleased to see him.\n\n\"What is this place?\" she asked.\n\n\"One o' th' kitchen-gardens,\" he answered.\n\n\"What is that?\" said Clara, pointing through the other green door.\n\n\"Another of 'em,\" shortly. \"There's another on t'other side o' th' wall an' there's th' orchard t'other side o' that.\"\n\n\"Can I go in them?\" asked Clara.\n\n\"If tha' likes. But there's nowt to see.\"\n\nClara made no response. She went down the path and through the second green door. There she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open. Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten years. As she was not at all a timid child and always did what she wanted to do, Clara went to the green door and turned the handle. She hoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious garden—but it did open quite easily and she walked through it and found herself in an orchard. There were walls all round it also and trees trained against [Pg 45]them, and there were bare fruit-trees growing in the winter-browned grass—but there was no green door to be seen anywhere. Clara looked for it, and yet when she had entered the upper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem to end with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place at the other side. She could see the tops of trees above the wall, and when she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into his winter song—almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her.\n\nShe stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful, friendly little whistle gave her a pleased feeling—even a disagreeable little girl may be lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and big bare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in the world but herself. If she had been an affectionate child, who had been used to being loved, she would have broken her heart, but even though she was \"Mistress Clara Quite Contrary\" she was desolate, and the bright-breasted little bird brought a look into her sour little face which was almost a smile. She listened to him until he flew away. He was not like an Indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she should ever see him again. Per[Pg 46]haps he lived in the mysterious garden and knew all about it.\n\nPerhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thought so much of the deserted garden. She was curious about it and wanted to see what it was like. Why had Mr. Alaric Thornfield buried the key? If he had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden? She wondered if she should ever see him, but she knew that if she did she should not like him, and he would not like her, and that she should only stand and stare at him and say nothing, though she should be wanting dreadfully to ask him why he had done such a queer thing.\n\n\"People never like me and I never like people,\" she thought. \"And I never can talk as the Crawford children could. They were always talking and laughing and making noises.\"\n\nShe thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song at her, and as she remembered the tree-top he perched on she stopped rather suddenly on the path.\n\n\"I believe that tree was in the secret garden—I feel sure it was,\" she said. \"There was a wall round the place and there was no door.\"\n\nShe walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered and found the old man digging there. She went and stood beside him and [Pg 47]watched him a few moments in her cold little way. He took no notice of her and so at last she spoke to him.\n\n\"I have been into the other gardens,\" she said.\n\n\"There was nothin' to prevent thee,\" he answered crustily.\n\n\"I went into the orchard.\"\n\n\"There was no dog at th' door to bite thee,\" he answered.\n\n\"There was no door there into the other garden,\" said Clara.\n\n\"What garden?\" he said in a rough voice, stopping his digging for a moment.\n\n\"The one on the other side of the wall,\" answered Mistress Clara. \"There are trees there—I saw the tops of them. A bird with a red breast was sitting on one of them and he sang.\"\n\nTo her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed its expression. A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite different. It made her think that it was curious how much nicer a person looked when he smiled. She had not thought of it before.\n\nHe turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began to whistle—a low soft whistle. She could not understand how such a surly man could make such a coaxing sound.[Pg 48]\n\nAlmost the next moment a wonderful thing happened. She heard a soft little rushing flight through the air—and it was the bird with the red breast flying to them, and he actually alighted on the big clod of earth quite near to the gardener's foot.\n\n\"Here he is,\" chuckled the old man, and then he spoke to the bird as if he were speaking to a child.\n\n\"Where has tha' been, tha' cheeky little beggar?\" he said. \"I've not seen thee before to-day. Has tha' begun tha' courtin' this early in th' season? Tha'rt too forrad.\"\n\nThe bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with his soft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop. He seemed quite familiar and not the least afraid. He hopped about and pecked the earth briskly, looking for seeds and insects. It actually gave Clara a queer feeling in her heart, because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like a person. He had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak, and slender delicate legs.\n\n\"Will he always come when you call him?\" she asked almost in a whisper.\n\n\"Aye, that he will. I've knowed him ever since he was a fledgling. He come out of th' nest in th' other garden an' when first he flew over th'[Pg 49] wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an' we got friendly. When he went over th' wall again th' rest of th' brood was gone an' he was lonely an' he come back to me.\"\n\n\"What kind of a bird is he?\" Clara asked.\n\n\"Doesn't tha' know? He's a robin redbreast an' they're th' friendliest, curiousest birds alive. They're almost as friendly as dogs—if you know how to get on with 'em. Watch him peckin' about there an' lookin' round at us now an' again. He knows we're talkin' about him.\"\n\nIt was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow. He looked at the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he were both proud and fond of him.\n\n\"He's a conceited one,\" he chuckled. \"He likes to hear folk talk about him. An' curious—bless me, there never was his like for curiosity an' meddlin'. He's always comin' to see what I'm plantin'. He knows all th' things Mester Thornfield never troubles hissel' to find out. He's th' head gardener, he is.\"\n\nThe robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped and looked at them a little. Clara thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed at her with great curiosity. It really seemed as if he were finding out all about her. The queer feeling in her heart increased.[Pg 50]\n\n\"Where did the rest of the brood fly to?\" she asked.\n\n\"There's no knowin'. The old ones turn 'em out o' their nest an' make 'em fly an' they're scattered before you know it. This one was a knowin' one an' he knew he was lonely.\"\n\nMistress Clara went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him very hard.\n\n\"I'm lonely,\" she said.\n\nShe had not known before that this was one of the things which made her feel sour and cross. She seemed to find it out when the robin looked at her and she looked at the robin.\n\nThe old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at her a minute.\n\n\"Art tha' th' little wench from India?\" he asked.\n\nClara nodded.\n\n\"Then no wonder tha'rt lonely. Tha'lt be lonelier before tha's done,\" he said.\n\nHe began to dig again, driving his spade deep into the rich black garden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed.\n\n\"What is your name?\" Clara inquired.\n\nHe stood up to answer her.\n\n\"Gus Greenfield,\" he answered, and then he added with a surly chuckle, \"I'm lonely mysel'[Pg 51] except when he's with me,\" and he jerked his thumb toward the robin. \"He's th' only friend I've got.\"\n\n\"I have no friends at all,\" said Clara. \"I never had. My Nanny didn't like me and I never played with any one.\"\n\nIt is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness, and old Gus Greenfield was a Yorkshire moor man.\n\n\"Tha' an' me are a good bit alike,\" he said. \"We was wove out of th' same cloth. We're neither of us good lookin' an' we're both of us as sour as we look. We've got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I'll warrant.\"\n\nThis was plain speaking, and Clara Bright had never heard the truth about herself in her life. Native servants always salaamed and submitted to you, whatever you did. She had never thought much about her looks, but she wondered if she was as unattractive as Gus Greenfield and she also wondered if she looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came. She actually began to wonder also if she was \"nasty tempered.\" She felt uncomfortable.\n\nSuddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she turned round. She was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and the robin [Pg 52]had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song. Gus Greenfield laughed outright.\n\n\"What did he do that for?\" asked Clara.\n\n\"He's made up his mind to make friends with thee,\" replied Ben. \"Dang me if he hasn't took a fancy to thee.\"\n\n\"To me?\" said Clara, and she moved toward the little tree softly and looked up.\n\n\"Would you make friends with me?\" she said to the robin just as if she was speaking to a person. \"Would you?\" And she did not say it either in her hard little voice or in her imperious Indian voice, but in a tone so soft and eager and coaxing that Gus Greenfield was as surprised as she had been when she heard him whistle.\n\n\"Why,\" he cried out, \"tha' said that as nice an' human as if tha' was a real child instead of a sharp old woman. Tha' said it almost like Ewan talks to his wild things on th' moor.\"\n\n\"Do you know Ewan?\" Clara asked, turning round rather in a hurry.\n\n\"Everybody knows him. Ewan's wanderin' about everywhere. Th' very blackberries an' heather-bells knows him. I warrant th' foxes shows him where their cubs lies an' th' skylarks doesn't hide their nests from him.\"\n\nClara would have liked to ask some more ques[Pg 53]tions. She was almost as curious about Ewan as she was about the deserted garden. But just that moment the robin, who had ended his song, gave a little shake of his wings, spread them and flew away. He had made his visit and had other things to do.\n\n\"He has flown over the wall!\" Clara cried out, watching him. \"He has flown into the orchard—he has flown across the other wall—into the garden where there is no door!\"\n\n\"He lives there,\" said old Ben. \"He came out o' th' egg there. If he's courtin', he's makin' up to some young madam of a robin that lives among th' old rose-trees there.\"\n\n\"Rose-trees,\" said Clara. \"Are there rose-trees?\"\n\nGus Greenfield took up his spade again and began to dig.\n\n\"There was ten year' ago,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"I should like to see them,\" said Clara. \"Where is the green door? There must be a door somewhere.\"\n\nBen drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he had looked when she first saw him.\n\n\"There was ten year' ago, but there isn't now,\" he said.\n\n\"No door!\" cried Clara. \"There must be.\"[Pg 54]\n\n\"None as any one can find, an' none as is any one's business. Don't you be a meddlesome wench an' poke your nose where it's no cause to go. Here, I must go on with my work. Get you gone an' play you. I've no more time.\"\n\nAnd he actually stopped digging, threw his spade over his shoulder and walked off, without even glancing at her or saying good-by.[Pg 55]\n\nCHAPTER V\nTHE CRY IN THE CORRIDOR\nAt first each day which passed by for Clara Bright was exactly like the others. Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Libby kneeling upon the hearth building her fire; every morning she ate her breakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after each breakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor which seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and after she had stared for a while she realized that if she did not go out she would have to stay in and do nothing—and so she went out. She did not know that this was the best thing she could have done, and she did not know that, when she began to walk quickly or even run along the paths and down the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and making herself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor. She ran only to make herself warm, and she hated the wind which rushed at her face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she could not see.[Pg 56] But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heather filled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin body and whipped some red color into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything about it.\n\nBut after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened one morning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she sat down to her breakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push it away, but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it until her bowl was empty.\n\n\"Tha' got on well enough with that this mornin', didn't tha'?\" said Libby.\n\n\"It tastes nice to-day,\" said Clara, feeling a little surprised herself.\n\n\"It's th' air of th' moor that's givin' thee stomach for tha' victuals,\" answered Libby. \"It's lucky for thee that tha's got victuals as well as appetite. There's been twelve in our cottage as had th' stomach an' nothin' to put in it. You go on playin' you out o' doors every day an' you'll get some flesh on your bones an' you won't be so yeller.\"\n\n\"I don't play,\" said Clara. \"I have nothing to play with.\"\n\n\"Nothin' to play with!\" exclaimed Libby.[Pg 57] \"Our children plays with sticks and stones. They just runs about an' shouts an' looks at things.\"\n\nClara did not shout, but she looked at things. There was nothing else to do. She walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the paths in the park. Sometimes she looked for Gus Greenfield, but though several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or was too surly. Once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spade and turned away as if he did it on purpose.\n\nOne place she went to oftener than to any other. It was the long walk outside the gardens with the walls round them. There were bare flower-beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly. There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves were more bushy than elsewhere. It seemed as if for a long time that part had been neglected. The rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat, but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all.\n\nA few days after she had talked to Gus Greenfield Clara stopped to notice this and wondered why it was so. She had just paused and was looking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw a gleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of the wall, [Pg 58]perched Gus Greenfield's robin redbreast, tilting forward to look at her with his small head on one side.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried out, \"is it you—is it you?\" And it did not seem at all queer to her that she spoke to him as if she was sure that he would understand and answer her.\n\nHe did answer. He twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if he were telling her all sorts of things. It seemed to Mistress Clara as if she understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words. It was as if he said:\n\n\"Good morning! Isn't the wind nice? Isn't the sun nice? Isn't everything nice? Let us both chirp and hop and twitter. Come on! Come on!\"\n\nClara began to laugh, and as he hopped and took little flights along the wall she ran after him. Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Clara—she actually looked almost pretty for a moment.\n\n\"I like you! I like you!\" she cried out, pattering down the walk; and she chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did not know how to do in the least. But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped and whistled back at her. At last he spread his wings and made a darting flight to the top of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.[Pg 59]\n\nThat reminded Clara of the first time she had seen him. He had been swinging on a tree-top then and she had been standing in the orchard. Now she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path outside a wall—much lower down—and there was the same tree inside.\n\n\"It's in the garden no one can go into,\" she said to herself. \"It's the garden without a door. He lives in there. How I wish I could see what it is like!\"\n\nShe ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning. Then she ran down the path through the other door and then into the orchard, and when she stood and looked up there was the tree on the other side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing his song and beginning to preen his feathers with his beak.\n\n\"It is the garden,\" she said. \"I am sure it is.\"\n\nShe walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall, but she only found what she had found before—that there was no door in it. Then she ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walk outside the long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to the end of it and looked at it, but there was no door; and then she [Pg 60]walked to the other end, looking again, but there was no door.\n\n\"It's very queer,\" she said. \"Gus Greenfield said there was no door and there is no door. But there must have been one ten years ago, because Mr. Thornfield buried the key.\"\n\nThis gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interested and feel that she was not sorry that she had come to Misselthwaite Manor. In India she had always felt hot and too languid to care much about anything. The fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begun to blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a little.\n\nShe stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat down to her supper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable. She did not feel cross when Libby chattered away. She felt as if she rather liked to hear her, and at last she thought she would ask her a question. She asked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on the hearth-rug before the fire.\n\n\"Why did Mr. Thornfield hate the garden?\" she said.\n\nShe had made Libby stay with her and Libby had not objected at all. She was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and sisters, and she found it dull in the great servants'[Pg 61] hall down-stairs where the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire speech and looked upon her as a common little thing, and sat and whispered among themselves. Libby liked to talk, and the strange child who had lived in India, and been waited upon by \"blacks,\" was novelty enough to attract her.\n\nShe sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked.\n\n\"Art tha' thinkin' about that garden yet?\" she said. \"I knew tha' would. That was just the way with me when I first heard about it.\"\n\n\"Why did he hate it?\" Clara persisted.\n\nLibby tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable.\n\n\"Listen to th' wind wutherin' round the house,\" she said. \"You could bare stand up on the moor if you was out on it to-night.\"\n\nClara did not know what \"wutherin'\" meant until she listened, and then she understood. It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which rushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were buffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in. But one knew he could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very safe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire.\n\n\"But why did he hate it so?\" she asked, after [Pg 62]she had listened. She intended to know if Libby did.\n\nThen Libby gave up her store of knowledge.\n\n\"Mind,\" she said, \"Mrs. Winslow said it's not to be talked about. There's lots o' things in this place that's not to be talked over. That's Mr. Thornfield's orders. His troubles are none servants' business, he says. But for th' garden he wouldn't be like he is. It was Mrs. Thornfield's garden that she had made when first they were married an' she just loved it, an' they used to 'tend the flowers themselves. An' none o' th' gardeners was ever let to go in. Him an' her used to go in an' shut th' door an' stay there hours an' hours, readin' an' talkin'. An' she was just a bit of a girl an' there was an old tree with a branch bent like a seat on it. An' she made roses grow over it an' she used to sit there. But one day when she was sittin' there th' branch broke an' she fell on th' ground an' was hurt so bad that next day she died. Th' doctors thought he'd go out o' his mind an' die, too. That's why he hates it. No one's never gone in since, an' he won't let any one talk about it.\"\n\nClara did not ask any more questions. She looked at the red fire and listened to the wind \"wutherin'.\" It seemed to be \"wutherin'\" louder than ever.[Pg 63]\n\nAt that moment a very good thing was happening to her. Four good things had happened to her, in fact, since she came to Misselthwaite Manor. She had felt as if she had understood a robin and that he had understood her; she had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm; she had been healthily hungry for the first time in her life; and she had found out what it was to be sorry for some one. She was getting on.\n\nBut as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something else. She did not know what it was, because at first she could scarcely distinguish it from the wind itself. It was a curious sound—it seemed almost as if a child were crying somewhere. Sometimes the wind sounded rather like a child crying, but presently Mistress Clara felt quite sure that this sound was inside the house, not outside it. It was far away, but it was inside. She turned round and looked at Libby.\n\n\"Do you hear any one crying?\" she said.\n\nLibby suddenly looked confused.\n\n\"No,\" she answered. \"It's th' wind. Sometimes it sounds like as if some one was lost on th' moor an' wailin'. It's got all sorts o' sounds.\"\n\n\"But listen,\" said Clara. \"It's in the house—down one of those long corridors.\"\n\nAnd at that very moment a door must have been [Pg 64]opened somewhere down-stairs; for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and the door of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as they both jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the crying sound was swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainly than ever.\n\n\"There!\" said Clara. \"I told you so! It is some one crying—and it isn't a grown-up person.\"\n\nLibby ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she did it they both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a bang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased \"wutherin'\" for a few moments.\n\n\"It was th' wind,\" said Libby stubbornly. \"An' if it wasn't, it was little Betty Butterworth, th' scullery-maid. She's had th' toothache all day.\"\n\nBut something troubled and awkward in her manner made Mistress Clara stare very hard at her. She did not believe she was speaking the truth.[Pg 65]\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\"THERE WAS SOME ONE CRYING—THERE WAS!\"\nThe next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Clara looked out of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and cloud. There could be no going out to-day.\n\n\"What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?\" she asked Libby.\n\n\"Try to keep from under each other's feet mostly,\" Libby answered. \"Eh! there does seem a lot of us then. Mother's a good-tempered woman but she gets fair moithered. The biggest ones goes out in th' cow-shed and plays there. Ewan he doesn't mind th' wet. He goes out just th' same as if th' sun was shinin'. He says he sees things on rainy days as doesn't show when it's fair weather. He once found a little fox cub half drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th' bosom of his shirt to keep it warm. Its mother had been killed nearby an' th' hole was swum out an' th' rest o' th' litter was dead. He's got it at home now. He found a [Pg 66]half-drowned young crow another time an' he brought it home, too, an' tamed it. It's named Soot because it's so black, an' it hops an' flies about with him everywhere.\"\n\nThe time had come when Clara had forgotten to resent Libby's familiar talk. She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when she stopped or went away. The stories she had been told by her Nanny when she lived in India had been quite unlike those Libby had to tell about the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four little rooms and never had quite enough to eat. The children seemed to tumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured collie puppies. Clara was most attracted by the mother and Ewan. When Libby told stories of what \"mother\" said or did they always sounded comfortable.\n\n\"If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,\" said Clara. \"But I have nothing.\"\n\nLibby looked perplexed.\n\n\"Can tha' knit?\" she asked.\n\n\"No,\" answered Clara.\n\n\"Can tha' sew?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Can tha' read?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then why doesn't tha' read somethin', or [Pg 67]learn a bit o' spellin'? Tha'st old enough to be learnin' thy book a good bit now.\"\n\n\"I haven't any books,\" said Clara. \"Those I had were left in India.\"\n\n\"That's a pity,\" said Libby. \"If Mrs. Winslow'd let thee go into th' library, there's thousands o' books there.\"\n\nClara did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenly inspired by a new idea. She made up her mind to go and find it herself. She was not troubled about Mrs. Winslow. Mrs. Winslow seemed always to be in her comfortable housekeeper's sitting-room down-stairs. In this queer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all. In fact, there was no one to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived a luxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung about with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants' hall where there were four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a great deal of lively romping went on when Mrs. Winslow was out of the way.\n\nClara's meals were served regularly, and Libby waited on her, but no one troubled themselves about her in the least. Mrs. Winslow came and looked at her every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or told her what to do. She supposed that perhaps this was the English way [Pg 68]of treating children. In India she had always been attended by her Nanny, who had followed her about and waited on her, hand and foot. She had often been tired of her company. Now she was followed by nobody and was learning to dress herself because Libby looked as though she thought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to her and put on.\n\n\"Hasn't tha' got good sense?\" she said once, when Clara had stood waiting for her to put on her gloves for her. \"Our Ella Mae is twice as sharp as thee an' she's only four year' old. Sometimes tha' looks fair soft in th' head.\"\n\nClara had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made her think several entirely new things.\n\nShe stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Libby had swept up the hearth for the last time and gone down-stairs. She was thinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the library. She did not care very much about the library itself, because she had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mind the hundred rooms with closed doors. She wondered if they were all really locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them. Were there a hundred really? Why shouldn't she go and see how many doors [Pg 69]she could count? It would be something to do on this morning when she could not go out. She had never been taught to ask permission to do things, and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would not have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Winslow if she might walk about the house, even if she had seen her.\n\nShe opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then she began her wanderings. It was a long corridor and it branched into other corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted to others again. There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on the walls. Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes, but oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand costumes made of satin and velvet. She found herself in one long gallery whose walls were covered with these portraits. She had never thought there could be so many in any house. She walked slowly down this place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her. She felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in their house. Some were pictures of children—little girls in thick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffs around their necks. She always [Pg 70]stopped to look at the children, and wonder what their names were, and where they had gone, and why they wore such odd clothes. There was a stiff, plain little girl rather like herself. She wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on her finger. Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.\n\n\"Where do you live now?\" said Clara aloud to her. \"I wish you were here.\"\n\nSurely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning. It seemed as if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own small self, wandering about up-stairs and down, through narrow passages and wide ones, where it seemed to her that no one but herself had ever walked. Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived in them, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it true.\n\nIt was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of turning the handle of a door. All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Winslow had said they were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one of them and turned it. She was almost frightened for a moment when she felt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the door itself it slowly and heavily opened. It was a massive door and opened into a big bedroom. There were embroidered hang[Pg 71]ings on the wall, and inlaid furniture such as she had seen in India stood about the room. A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and over the mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl who seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever.\n\n\"Perhaps she slept here once,\" said Clara. \"She stares at me so that she makes me feel queer.\"\n\nAfter that she opened more doors and more. She saw so many rooms that she became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred, though she had not counted them. In all of them there were old pictures or old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them. There were curious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them.\n\nIn one room, which looked like a lady's sitting-room, the hangings were all embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred little elephants made of ivory. They were of different sizes, and some had their mahouts or palanquins on their backs. Some were much bigger than the others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies. Clara had seen carved ivory in India and she knew all about elephants. She opened the door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these for quite a long time. When [Pg 72]she got tired she set the elephants in order and shut the door of the cabinet.\n\nIn all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms, she had seen nothing alive; but in this room she saw something. Just after she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound. It made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, from which it seemed to come. In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion, and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the hole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it.\n\nClara crept softly across the room to look. The bright eyes belonged to a little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion and made a comfortable nest there. Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep near her. If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there were seven mice who did not look lonely at all.\n\n\"If they wouldn't be so frightened I would take them back with me,\" said Clara.\n\nShe had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any farther, and she turned back. Two or three times she lost her way by turning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down until she found the right one; but at last she reached her own floor again, [Pg 73]though she was some distance from her own room and did not know exactly where she was.\n\n\"I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,\" she said, standing still at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall. \"I don't know which way to go. How still everything is!\"\n\nIt was while she was standing here and just after she had said this that the stillness was broken by a sound. It was another cry, but not quite like the one she had heard last night; it was only a short one, a fretful, childish whine muffled by passing through walls.\n\n\"It's nearer than it was,\" said Clara, her heart beating rather faster. \"And it is crying.\"\n\nShe put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her, and then sprang back, feeling quite startled. The tapestry was the covering of a door which fell open and showed her that there was another part of the corridor behind it, and Mrs. Winslow was coming up it with her bunch of keys in her hand and a very cross look on her face.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" she said, and she took Clara by the arm and pulled her away. \"What did I tell you?\"\n\n\"I turned round the wrong corner,\" explained Clara. \"I didn't know which way to go and I heard some one crying.\"[Pg 74]\n\nShe quite hated Mrs. Winslow at the moment, but she hated her more the next.\n\n\"You didn't hear anything of the sort,\" said the housekeeper. \"You come along back to your own nursery or I'll box your ears.\"\n\nAnd she took her by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her up one passage and down another until she pushed her in at the door of her own room.\n\n\"Now,\" she said, \"you stay where you're told to stay or you'll find yourself locked up. The master had better get you a governess, same as he said he would. You're one that needs some one to look sharp after you. I've got enough to do.\"\n\nShe went out of the room and slammed the door after her, and Clara went and sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage. She did not cry, but ground her teeth.\n\n\"There was some one crying—there was—there was!\" she said to herself.\n\nShe had heard it twice now, and sometime she would find out. She had found out a great deal this morning. She felt as if she had been on a long journey, and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all the time, and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the gray mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion.[Pg 75]\n\nCHAPTER VII\nTHE KEY OF THE GARDEN\nTwo days after this, when Clara opened her eyes she sat upright in bed immediately, and called to Libby.\n\n\"Look at the moor! Look at the moor!\"\n\nThe rain-storm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind. The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland. Never, never had Clara dreamed of a sky so blue. In India skies were hot and blazing; this was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece. The far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Libby with a cheerful grin. \"Th' storm's over for a bit. It does like this at this time o' th' year. It goes off in a night like it was pretendin' it had never been here an' never [Pg 76]meant to come again. That's because th' springtime's on its way. It's a long way off yet, but it's comin'.\"\n\n\"I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England,\" Clara said.\n\n\"Eh! no!\" said Libby, sitting up on her heels among her black lead brushes. \"Nowt o' th' soart!\"\n\n\"Wha",

    "context": " birth, with stronger assimilations than the first, had converted the forest-land, still so uncongenial to every other pilgrim and wanderer, into Eliza Somer’s wild and dreary, but life-long home. All other scenes of earth—even that village of rural England, where happy infancy and stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her mother’s keeping, like garments put off long ago—were foreign to her, in comparison. The chain that bound her here was of iron links, and galling to her inmost soul, but could never be broken.\n\nIt might be, too,—doubtless it was so, although she hid the secret from herself, and grew pale whenever it struggled out of her heart, like a serpent from its hole,—it might be that another feeling kept her within the scene and pathway that had been so fatal. There dwelt, there trode the feet of one with whom she deemed herself connected in a union, that, unrecognized on earth, would bring them together before the bar of final judgment, and make that their marriage-altar, for a joint futurity of endless retribution. Over and over again, the tempter of souls had thrust this idea upon Eliza’s contemplation, and laughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she[93] seized, and then strove to cast it from her. She barely looked the idea in the face, and hastened to bar it in its dungeon. What she compelled herself to believe—what, finally, she reasoned upon, as her motive for continuing a resident of New England—was half a truth, and half a self-delusion. Here, she said to herself, had been the scene of her guilt, and here should be the scene of her earthly punishment; and so, perchance, the torture of her daily shame would at length purge her soul, and work out another purity than that which she had lost; more saint-like, because the result of martyrdom.\n\nThe Lonesome Dwelling\n\nEliza Somer, therefore, did not flee. On the outskirts of the town, within the verge of the peninsula, but not in close vicinity to any other habitation, there was a small thatched cottage. It had been built by an earlier settler, and abandoned because the soil about it was too sterile for cultivation, while its comparative remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity which already marked the habits of the emigrants. It stood on the shore, looking across a basin of the sea at the forest-covered hills, towards the west. A clump of scrubby trees, such as alone[94] grew on the peninsula, did not so much conceal the cottage from view, as seem to denote that here was some object which would fain have been, or at least ought to be, concealed. In this little, lonesome dwelling, with some slender means that she possessed, and by the license of the magistrates, who still kept an inquisitorial watch over her, Eliza established herself, with her infant child. A mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot. Children, too young to comprehend wherefore this woman should be shut out from the sphere of human charities, would creep nigh enough to behold her plying her needle at the cottage-window, or standing in the doorway, or laboring in her little garden, or coming forth along the pathway that led townward; and, discerning the scarlet letter on her breast, would scamper off with a strange, contagious fear.\n\nLonely as was Eliza’s situation, and without a friend on earth who dared to show himself, she, however, incurred no risk of want. She possessed an art that sufficed, even in a land that afforded comparatively little scope for its exercise, to supply food for her thriving infant and herself. It was the art—then, as now, almost the only one within a woman’s grasp—of needlework. She bore on her breast, in the curiously embroidered letter, a specimen of her delicate and imaginative skill, of which the dames of a court might gladly have availed themselves, to add the richer and more spiritual adornment of human ingenuity to their fabrics of silk and gold. Here, indeed, in the sable simplicity that generally characterized the Puritanic modes of dress, there might be an infrequent call for the finer productions of her handiwork. Yet the taste of the age, demanding whatever was elaborate in compositions of this kind, did not fail to[95] extend its influence over our stern progenitors, who had cast behind them so many fashions which it might seem harder to dispense with. Public ceremonies, such as ordinations, the installation of magistrates, and all that could give majesty to the forms in which a new government manifested itself to the people, were, as a matter of policy, marked by a stately and well-conducted ceremonial, and a sombre, but yet a studied magnificence. Deep ruffs, painfully wrought bands, and gorgeously embroidered gloves, were all deemed necessary to the official state of men assuming the reins of power; and were readily allowed to individuals dignified by rank or wealth, even while sumptuary laws forbade these and similar extravagances to the plebeian order. In the array of funerals, too,—whether for the apparel of the dead body, or to typify, by manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth and snowy lawn, the sorrow of the survivors,—there was a frequent and characteristic demand for such labor as Eliza Somer could supply. Baby-linen—for babies then wore robes of state—afforded still another possibility of toil and emolument.\n\nBy degrees, nor very slowly, her handiwork became what would now be termed the fashion. Whether from commiseration for a woman of so miserable a destiny; or from the morbid curiosity that gives a fictitious value even to common or worthless things; or by whatever other intangible circumstance was then, as now, sufficient to bestow, on some persons, what others might seek in vain; or because Eliza really filled a gap which must otherwise have remained vacant; it is certain that she had ready and fairly requited employment for as many hours as she saw fit to occupy with her needle. Vanity, it may be, chose to mortify itself, by putting on, for ceremonials of pomp and state, the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands. Her[96] needlework was seen on the ruff of the Governor; military men wore it on their scarfs, and the minister on his band; it decked the baby’s little cap; it was shut up, to be mildewed and moulder away, in the coffins of the dead. But it is not recorded that, in a single instance, her skill was called in aid to embroider the white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of a bride. The exception indicated the ever-relentless rigor with which society frowned upon her sin.\n\nEliza sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence, of the plainest and most ascetic description, for herself, and a simple abundance for her child. Her own dress was of the coarsest materials and the most sombre hue; with only that one ornament,—the scarlet letter,—which it was her doom to wear. The child’s attire, on the other hand, was distinguished by a fanciful, or, we might rather say, a fantastic ingenuity, which served, indeed, to heighten the airy charm that early began to develop itself in the little girl, but which appeared to have also a deeper meaning. We may speak further of it hereafter. Except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant, Eliza bestowed all her superfluous means in charity, on wretches less miserable than herself, and who not unfrequently insulted the hand that fed them. Much of the time, which she might readily have applied to the better efforts of her art, she employed in making coarse garments for the poor. It is probable that there was an idea of penance in this mode of occupation, and that she offered up a real sacrifice of enjoyment, in devoting so many hours to such rude handiwork. She had in her nature a rich, voluptuous, Oriental characteristic,—a taste for the gorgeously beautiful, which, save in the exquisite productions of her needle, found nothing else, in all the possibilities of her life, to exercise[97] itself upon. Women derive a pleasure, incomprehensible to the other sex, from the delicate toil of the needle. To Eliza Somer it might have been a mode of expressing, and therefore soothing, the passion of her life. Like all other joys, she rejected it as sin. This morbid meddling of conscience with an immaterial matter betokened, it is to be feared, no genuine and steadfast penitence, but something doubtful, something that might be deeply wrong, beneath.\n\nIn this manner, Eliza Somer came to have a part to perform in the world. With her native energy of character, and rare capacity, it could not entirely cast her off, although it had set a mark upon her, more intolerable to a woman’s heart than that which branded the brow of Cain. In all her intercourse with society, however, there was nothing that made her feel as if she belonged to it. Every gesture, every word, and even the silence of those with whom she came in contact, implied, and often expressed, that she was banished, and as much alone as if she inhabited another sphere, or communicated with the common nature by other organs and senses than the rest of human kind. She stood apart from moral interests, yet close beside them, like a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside, and can no longer make itself seen or felt; no more smile with the household joy, nor mourn with the kindred sorrow; or, should it succeed in manifesting its forbidden sympathy, awakening only terror and horrible repugnance. These emotions, in fact, and its bitterest scorn besides, seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in the universal heart. It was not an age of delicacy; and her position, although she understood it well, and was in little danger of forgetting it, was often brought before her vivid self-perception, like a new anguish, by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot.[98] The poor, as we have already said, whom she sought out to be the objects of her bounty, often reviled the hand that was stretched forth to succor them. Dames of elevated rank, likewise, whose doors she entered in the way of her occupation, were accustomed to distil drops of bitterness into her heart; sometimes through that alchemy of quiet malice, by which women can concoct a subtle poison from ordinary trifles; and sometimes, also, by a coarser expression, that fell upon the sufferer’s defenceless breast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound. Eliza had schooled herself long and well; she never responded to these attacks, save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek, and again subsided into the depths of her bosom. She was patient,—a martyr, indeed,—but she forbore to pray for her enemies; lest, in spite of her forgiving aspirations, the words of the blessing should stubbornly twist themselves into a curse.\n\nContinually, and in a thousand other ways, did she feel the innumerable throbs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrived for her by the undying, the ever-active sentence of the Puritan tribunal. Clergymen paused in the street to address words of exhortation, that brought a crowd, with its mingled grin and frown, around the poor, sinful woman. If she entered a church, trusting to share the Sabbath smile of the Universal Father, it was often her mishap to find herself the text of the discourse. She grew to have a dread of children; for they had imbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horrible in this dreary woman, gliding silently through the town, with never any companion but one only child. Therefore, first allowing her to pass, they pursued her at a distance with shrill cries, and the utterance of a word that had no distinct purport to their own minds, but was none the less terrible to her, as proceeding from lips that babbled it unconsciously. It seemed to argue so wide a diffusion of her shame, that all nature knew of it; it could have caused her no deeper pang, had the leaves of the trees whispered the dark story among themselves,—had the summer breeze murmured about it,—had the wintry blast shrieked it aloud! Another peculiar torture was felt in the gaze of a new eye. When strangers looked curiously at the scarlet letter,—and none ever failed to do so,—they branded it afresh into Eliza’s soul; so that, oftentimes, she could scarcely refrain, yet always did refrain, from covering the symbol with her hand. But then, again, an accustomed eye had likewise its own anguish to inflict. Its cool stare of familiarity was intolerable. From first to last, in short, Eliza Somer had always this dreadful agony in feeling a human eye upon the token; the spot never grew callous; it seemed, on the contrary, to grow more sensitive with daily torture.\n\n[99]Lonely Footsteps\n\nBut sometimes, once in many days, or perchance in many months, she felt an eye—a human eye—upon the ignominious brand, that seemed to give a momentary relief, as if half of her[100] agony were shared. The next instant, back it all rushed again, with still a deeper throb of pain; for, in that brief interval, she had sinned anew. Had Eliza sinned alone?\n\nHer imagination was somewhat affected, and, had she been[101] of a softer moral and intellectual fibre, would have been still more so, by the strange and solitary anguish of her life. Walking to and fro, with those lonely footsteps, in the little world with which she was outwardly connected, it now and then appeared to Eliza,—if altogether fancy, it was nevertheless too potent to be resisted,—she felt or fancied, then, that the scarlet letter[102] had endowed her with a new sense. She shuddered to believe, yet could not help believing, that it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts. She was terror-stricken by the revelations that were thus made. What were they? Could they be other than the insidious whispers of the bad angel, who would fain have persuaded the struggling woman, as yet only half his victim, that the outward guise of purity was but a lie, and that, if truth were everywhere to be shown, a scarlet letter would blaze forth on many a bosom besides Eliza Somer’s? Or, must she receive those intimations—so obscure, yet so distinct—as truth? In all her miserable experience, there was nothing else so awful and so loathsome as this sense. It perplexed, as well as shocked her, by the irreverent inopportuneness of the occasions that brought it into vivid action. Sometimes the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic throb, as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate, the model of piety and justice, to whom that age of antique reverence looked up, as to a mortal man in fellowship with angels. “What evil thing is at hand?” would Eliza say to herself. Lifting her reluctant eyes, there would be nothing human within the scope of view, save the form of this earthly saint! Again, a mystic sisterhood would contumaciously assert itself, as she met the sanctified frown of some matron, who, according to the rumor of all tongues, had kept cold snow within her bosom throughout life. That unsunned snow in the matron’s bosom, and the burning shame on Eliza Somer’s,—what had the two in common? Or, once more, the electric thrill would give her warning,—“Behold, Eliza, here is a companion!”—and, looking up, she would detect the eyes of a young maiden glancing at the scarlet letter, shyly and aside, and quickly averted with[103] a faint, chill crimson in her cheeks; as if her purity were somewhat sullied by that momentary glance. O Fiend, whose talisman was that fatal symbol, wouldst thou leave nothing, whether in youth or age, for this poor sinner to revere?—such loss of faith is ever one of the saddest results of sin. Be it accepted as a proof that all was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty, and man’s hard law, that Eliza Somer yet struggled to believe that no fellow-mortal was guilty like herself.\n\nThe vulgar, who, in those dreary old times, were always contributing a grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations, had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily work up into a terrific legend. They averred, that the symbol was not mere scarlet cloth, tinged in an earthly dye-pot, but was red-hot with infernal fire, and could be seen glowing all alight, whenever Eliza Somer walked abroad in the night-time. And we must needs say, it seared Eliza’s bosom so deeply, that perhaps there was more truth in the rumor than our modern incredulity may be inclined to admit.\n\n\n[104]Vignette\nVI.\nPEARL.\n\nWe have as yet hardly spoken of the infant; that little creature, whose innocent life had sprung, by the inscrutable decree of Providence, a lovely and immortal flower, out of the rank luxuriance of a guilty passion. How strange it seemed to the sad woman, as she watched the growth, and the beauty that became every day more brilliant, and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child! Her Ruby!—For so had Eliza called her; not as a name expressive of her aspect, which had nothing of the calm, white, unimpassioned lustre that would be indicated by the comparison. But she named the infant “Ruby,” as being[105] of great price,—purchased with all she had,—her mother’s only treasure! How strange, indeed! Man had marked this woman’s sin by a scarlet letter, which had such potent and disastrous efficacy that no human sympathy could reach her, save it were sinful like herself. God, as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished, had given her a lovely child, whose place was on that same dishonored bosom, to connect her parent forever with the race and descent of mortals, and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven! Yet these thoughts affected Eliza Somer less with hope than apprehension. She knew that her deed had been evil; she could have no faith, therefore, that its result would be good. Day after day, she looked fearfully into the child’s expanding nature, ever dreading to detect some dark and wild peculiarity, that should correspond with the guiltiness to which she owed her being.\n\nCertainly, there was no physical defect. By its perfect shape, its vigor, and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried limbs, the infant was worthy to have been brought forth in Eden; worthy to have been left there, to be the plaything of the angels, after the world’s first parents were driven out. The child had a native grace which does not invariably coexist with faultless beauty; its attire, however simple, always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best. But little Ruby was not clad in rustic weeds. Her mother, with a morbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter, had bought the richest tissues that could be procured, and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore, before the public eye. So magnificent was the small figure, when thus arrayed, and such was the splendor of Ruby’s own proper beauty, shining through[106] the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness, that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her, on the darksome cottage floor. And yet a russet gown, torn and soiled with the child’s rude play, made a picture of her just as perfect. Ruby’s aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety; in this one child there were many children, comprehending the full scope between the wild-flower prettiness of a peasant-baby, and the pomp, in little, of an infant princess. Throughout all, however, there was a trait of passion, a certain depth of hue, which she never lost; and if, in any of her changes, she had grown fainter or paler, she would have ceased to be herself,—it would have been no longer Ruby!\n\nThis outward mutability indicated, and did not more than fairly express, the various properties of her inner life. Her nature appeared to possess depth, too, as well as variety; but—or else Eliza’s fears deceived her—it lacked reference and adaptation to the world into which she was born. The child could not be made amenable to rules. In giving her existence, a great law had been broken; and the result was a being whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant, but all in disorder; or with an order peculiar to themselves, amidst which the point of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered. Eliza could only account for the child’s character—and even then most vaguely and imperfectly—by recalling what she herself had been, during that momentous period while Ruby was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world, and her bodily frame from its material of earth. The mother’s impassioned state had been the medium through which were transmitted to the unborn infant the rays of its moral life; and, however white and clear originally, they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold,[107] the fiery lustre, the black shadow, and the untempered light of the intervening substance. Above all, the warfare of Eliza’s spirit, at that epoch, was perpetuated in Ruby. She could recognize her wild, desperate, defiant mood, the flightiness of her temper, and even some of the very cloud-shapes of gloom and despondency that had brooded in her heart. They were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young child’s disposition, but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind.\n\nThe discipline of the family, in those days, was of a far more rigid kind than now. The frown, the harsh rebuke, the frequent application of the rod, enjoined by Scriptural authority, were used, not merely in the way of punishment for actual offences, but as a wholesome regimen for the growth and promotion of all childish virtues. Eliza Somer, nevertheless, the lonely mother of this one child, ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity. Mindful, however, of her own errors and misfortunes, she early sought to impose a tender, but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge. But the task was beyond her skill. After testing both smiles and frowns, and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any calculable influence, Eliza was ultimately compelled to stand aside, and permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses. Physical compulsion or restraint was effectual, of course, while it lasted. As to any other kind of discipline, whether addressed to her mind or heart, little Ruby might or might not be within its reach, in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment. Her mother, while Ruby was yet an infant, grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look, that warned her when it would be labor thrown away to insist, persuade, or plead. It was a look so[108] intelligent, yet inexplicable, so perverse, sometimes so malicious, but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits, that Eliza could not help questioning, at such moments, whether Ruby were a human child. She seemed rather an airy sprite, which, after playing its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage floor, would flit away with a mocking smile. Whenever that look appeared in her wild, bright, deeply black eyes, it invested her with a strange remoteness and intangibility; it was as if she were hovering in the air and might vanish, like a glimmering light, that comes we know not whence, and goes we know not whither. Beholding it, Eliza was constrained to rush towards the child,—to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began,—to snatch her to her bosom, with a close pressure and earnest kisses,—not so much from overflowing love, as to assure herself that Ruby was flesh and blood, and not utterly delusive. But Ruby’s laugh, when she was caught, though full of merriment and music, made her mother more doubtful than before.\n\nHeart-smitten at this bewildering and baffling spell, that so often came between herself and her sole treasure, whom she had bought so dear, and who was all her world, Eliza sometimes burst into passionate tears. Then, perhaps,—for there was no foreseeing how it might affect her,—Ruby would frown, and clench her little fist, and harden her small features into a stern, unsympathizing look of discontent. Not seldom, she would laugh anew, and louder than before, like a thing incapable and unintelligent of human sorrow. Or—but this more rarely happened—she would be convulsed with a rage of grief, and sob out her love for her mother, in broken words, and seem intent on proving that she had a heart, by breaking it. Yet Eliza was hardly safe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness;[109] it passed, as suddenly as it came. Brooding over all these matters, the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit, but, by some irregularity in the process of conjuration, has failed to win the master-word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence. Her only real comfort was when the child lay in the placidity of sleep. Then she was sure of her, and tasted hours of quiet, sad, delicious happiness; until—perhaps with that perverse expression glimmering from beneath her opening lids—little Ruby awoke!\n\nHow soon—with what strange rapidity, indeed!—did Ruby arrive at an age that was capable of social intercourse, beyond the mother’s ever-ready smile and nonsense-words! And then what a happiness would it have been, could Eliza Somer have heard her clear, bird-like voice mingling with the uproar of other childish voices, and have distinguished and unravelled her own darling’s tones, amid all the entangled outcry of a group of sportive children! But this could never be. Ruby was a born outcast of the infantile world. An imp of evil, emblem and product of sin, she had no right among christened infants. Nothing was more remarkable than the instinct, as it seemed, with which the child comprehended her loneliness; the destiny that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her; the whole peculiarity, in short, of her position in respect to other children. Never, since her release from prison, had Eliza met the public gaze without her. In all her walks about the town, Ruby, too, was there; first as the babe in arms, and afterwards as the little girl, small companion of her mother, holding a forefinger with her whole grasp, and tripping along at the rate of three or four footsteps to one of Eliza’s. She saw the children of the settlement, on the grassy margin of the street, or at the domestic[110] thresholds, disporting themselves in such grim fashion as the Puritanic nurture would permit; playing at going to church, perchance; or at scourging Quakers; or taking scalps in a sham-fight with the Indians; or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft. Ruby saw, and gazed intently, but never sought to make acquaintance. If spoken to, she would not speak again. If the children gathered about her, as they sometimes did, Ruby would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath, snatching up stones to fling at them, with shrill, incoherent exclamations, that made her mother tremble, because they had so much the sound of a witch’s anathemas in some unknown tongue.\n\nThe truth was, that the little Puritans, being of the most intolerant brood that ever lived, had got a vague idea of something outlandish, unearthly, or at variance with ordinary fashions, in the mother and child; and therefore scorned them in their hearts, and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues. Ruby felt the sentiment, and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom. These outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value, and even comfort, for her mother; because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood, instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the child’s manifestations. It appalled her, nevertheless, to discern here, again, a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself. All this enmity and passion had Ruby inherited, by inalienable right, out of Eliza’s heart. Mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society; and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted Eliza Somer before Ruby’s birth, but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity.[111]\n\nAt home, within and around her mother’s cottage, Ruby wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance. The spell of life went forth from her ever-creative spirit, and communicated itself to a thousand objects, as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied. The unlikeliest materials—a stick, a bunch of rags, a flower—were the puppets of Ruby’s witchcraft, and, without undergoing any outward change, became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world. Her one baby-voice served a multitude of imaginary personages, old and young, to talk withal. The pine-trees, aged, black and solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze, needed little transformation to figure as Puritan elders; the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children, whom Ruby smote down and uprooted, most unmercifully. It was wonderful, the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect, with no continuity, indeed, but darting up and dancing, always in a state of preternatural activity,—soon sinking down, as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of life,—and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy. It was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights. In the mere exercise of the fancy, however, and the sportiveness of a growing mind, there might be little more than was observable in other children of bright faculties; except as Ruby, in the dearth of human playmates, was thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created. The singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded all these offspring of her own heart and mind. She never created a friend, but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragon’s teeth, whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies, against whom she rushed to battle. It was inexpressibly sad—then what[112] depth of sorrow to a mother, who felt in her own heart the cause!—to observe, in one so young, this constant recognition of an adverse world, and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good her cause, in the contest that must ensue.\n\nGazing at Ruby, Eliza Somer often dropped her work upon her knees, and cried out with an agony which she would fain have hidden, but which made utterance for itself, betwixt speech and a groan,—“O Father in Heaven,—if Thou art still my Father,—what is this being which I have brought into the world!” And Ruby, overhearing the ejaculation, or aware, through some more subtile channel, of those throbs of anguish, would turn her vivid and beautiful little face upon her mother, smile with sprite-like intelligence, and resume her play.\n\n[113]A Touch of Ruby’s Baby Hand\n\nOne peculiarity of the child’s deportment remains yet to be told. The very first thing which she had noticed in her life was—what?—not the mother’s smile, responding to it, as other babies do, by that faint, embryo smile of the little mouth, remembered so doubtfully afterwards, and with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile. By no means! But that first object of which Ruby seemed to become aware was—shall we say it?—the scarlet letter on Eliza’s bosom! One day, as her mother stooped over the cradle, the infant’s eyes had been caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter; and, putting up her little hand, she grasped at it, smiling, not doubtfully, but with a decided gleam, that gave her face the[114] look of a much older child. Then, gasping for breath, did Eliza Somer clutch the fatal token, instinctively endeavoring to tear it away; so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of Ruby’s baby-hand. Again, as if her mother’s agonized gesture were meant only to make sport for her, did little[115] Ruby look into her eyes, and smile! From that epoch, except when the child was asleep, Eliza had never felt a moment’s safety; not a moment’s calm enjoyment of her. Weeks, it is true, would sometimes elapse, during which Ruby’s gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter; but then, again, it would come at unawares, like the stroke of sudden death, and always with that peculiar smile, and odd expression of the eyes.\n\nOnce, this freakish, elvish cast came into the child’s eyes, while Eliza was looking at her own image in them, as mothers are fond of doing; and, suddenly,—for women in solitude, and with troubled hearts, are pestered with unaccountable delusions,—she fancied that she beheld, not her own miniature portrait, but another face, in the small black mirror of Ruby’s eye. It was a face, fiend-like, full of smiling malice, yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well, though seldom with a smile, and never with malice in them. It was as if an evil spirit possessed the child, and had just then peeped forth in mockery. Many a time afterwards had Eliza been tortured, though less vividly, by the same illusion.\n\nIn the afternoon of a certain summer’s day, after Ruby grew big enough to run about, she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild-flowers, and flinging them, one by one, at her mother’s bosom; dancing up and down, like a little elf, whenever she hit the scarlet letter. Eliza’s first motion had been to cover her bosom with her clasped hands. But, whether from pride or resignation, or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain, she resisted the impulse, and sat erect, pale as death, looking sadly into little Ruby’s wild eyes. Still came the battery of flowers, almost invariably hitting the mark, and covering the mother’s breast with hurts[116] for which she could find no balm in this world, nor knew how to seek it in another. At last, her shot being all expended, the child stood still and gazed at Eliza, with that little, laughing image of a fiend peeping out—or, whether it peeped or no, her mother so imagined it—from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes.\n\n“Child, what art thou?” cried the mother.\n\n“O, I am your little Ruby!” answered the child.\n\nBut, while she said it, Ruby laughed, and began to dance up and down, with the humorsome gesticulation of a little imp, whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney.\n\n“Art thou my child, in very truth?” asked Eliza.\n\nNor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for the moment, with a portion of genuine earnestness; for, such was Ruby’s wonderful intelligence, that her mother half doubted whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her existence, and might not now reveal herself.\n\n“Yes; I am little Ruby!” repeated the child, continuing her antics.\n\n“Thou art not my child! Thou art no Ruby of mine!” said the mother, half playfully; for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came over her, in the midst of her deepest suffering. “Tell me, then, what thou art, and who sent thee hither.”\n\n“Tell me, mother!” said the child, seriously, coming up to Eliza, and pressing herself close to her knees. “Do thou tell me!”\n\n“Thy Heavenly Father sent thee!” answered Eliza Somer.\n\nBut she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of the child. Whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness,[117] or because an evil spirit prompted her, she put up her small forefinger, and touched the scarlet letter.\n\n“He did not send me!” cried she, positively. “I have no Heavenly Father!”\n\n“Hush, Ruby, hush! Thou must not talk so!” answered the mother, suppressing a groan. “He sent us all into this world. He sent even me, thy mother. Then, much more, thee! Or, if not, thou strange and elfish child, whence didst thou come?”\n\n“Tell me! Tell me!” repeated Ruby, no longer seriously, but laughing, and capering about the floor. “It is thou that must tell me!”\n\nBut Eliza could not resolve the query, being herself in a dismal labyrinth of doubt. She remembered—betwixt a smile and a shudder—the talk of the neighboring towns-people; who, seeking vainly elsewhere for the child’s paternity, and observing some of her odd attributes, had given out that poor little Ruby was a demon offspring; such as, ever since old Catholic times, had occasionally been seen on earth, through the agency of their mother’s sin, and to promote some foul and wicked purpose. Luther, according to the scandal of his monkish enemies, was a brat of that hellish breed; nor was Ruby the only child to whom this inauspicious origin was assigned, among the New England Puritans.\n\n\n[118]Vignette\nVII.\nTHE GOVERNOR’S HALL.\n\nEliza Somer went, one day, to the mansion of Governor Harrington, with a pair of gloves, which she had fringed and embroidered to his order, and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state; for, though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank, he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy.\n\nAnother and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled Eliza, at this time, to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity[119] in the affairs of the settlement. It had reached her ears, that there was a design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants, cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion and government, to deprive her of her child. On the supposition that Ruby, as already hinted, was of demon origin, these good people not unreasonably argued that a Christian interest in the mother’s soul required them to remove such a stumbling-block from her path. If the child, on the other hand, were really capable of moral and religious growth, and possessed the elements of ultimate salvation, then, surely, it would enjoy all the fairer prospect of these advantages, by being transferred to wiser and better guardianship than Eliza Somer’s. Among those who promoted the design, Governor Harrington was said to be one of the most busy. It may appear singular, and indeed, not a little ludicrous, that an affair of this kind, which, in later days, would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than that of the selectmen of the town, should then have been a question publicly discussed, and on which statesmen of eminence took sides. At that epoch of pristine simplicity, however, matters of even slighter public interest, and of far less intrinsic weight, than the welfare of Eliza and her child, were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state. The period was hardly, if at all, earlier than that of our story, when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony, but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature.\n\nFull of concern, therefore,—but so conscious of her own right that it seemed scarcely an unequal match between the public, on the one side, and a lonely woman, backed by the sympathies[120] of nature, on the other,—Eliza Somer set forth from her solitary cottage. Little Ruby, of course, was her companion. She was now of an age to run lightly along by her mother’s side, and, constantly in motion, from morn till sunset, could have accomplished a much longer journey than that before her. Often, nevertheless, more from caprice than necessity, she demanded to be taken up in arms; but was soon as imperious to be set down again, and frisked onward before Eliza on the grassy pathway, with many a harmless trip and tumble. We have spoken of Ruby’s rich and luxuriant beauty; a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints; a bright complexion, eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow, and hair already of a deep, glossy brown, and which, in after years, would be nearly akin to black. There was fire in her and throughout her; she seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment. Her mother, in contriving the child’s garb, had allowed the gorgeous tendencies of her imagination their full play; arraying her in a crimson velvet tunic, of a peculiar cut, abundantly embroidered with fantasies and flourishes of gold-thread. So much strength of coloring, which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a fainter bloom, was admirably adapted to Ruby’s beauty, and made her the very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced upon the earth.\n\nBut it was a remarkable attribute of this garb, and, indeed, of the child’s whole appearance, that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded the beholder of the token which Eliza Somer was doomed to wear upon her bosom. It was the scarlet letter in another form; the scarlet letter endowed with life! The mother herself—as if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its form—had[121] carefully wrought out the similitude; lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity, to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture. But, in truth, Ruby was the one, as well as the other; and only in consequence of that identity had Eliza contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance.\n\nAs the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town, the children of the Puritans looked up from their play,—or what passed for play with those sombre little urchins,—and spake gravely one to another:—\n\n“Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter; and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running along by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!”\n\nBut Ruby, who was a dauntless child, after frowning, stamping her foot, and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures, suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies, and put them all to flight. She resembled, in her fierce pursuit of them, an infant pestilence,—the scarlet fever, or some such half-fledged angel of judgment,—whose mission was to punish the sins of the rising generation. She screamed and shouted, too, with a terrific volume of sound, which, doubtless, caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them. The victory accomplished, Ruby returned quietly to her mother, and looked up, smiling, into her face.\n\nWithout further adventure, they reached the dwelling of Governor Harrington. This was a large wooden house, built in a fashion of which there are specimens still extant in the streets of our older towns; now moss-grown, crumbling to decay, and melancholy at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences,[122] remembered or forgotten, that have happened, and passed away, within their dusky chambers. Then, however, there was the freshness of the passing year on its exterior, and the cheerfulness, gleaming forth from the sunny windows, of a human habitation, into which death had never entered. It had, indeed, a very cheery aspect; the walls being overspread with a kind of stucco, in which fragments of broken glass were plentifully intermixed; so that, when the sunshine fell aslant-wise over the front of the edifice, it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds had been flung against it by the double handful. The brilliancy might have befitted Aladdin’s palace, rather than the mansion of a grave old Puritan ruler. It was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams, suitable to the quaint taste of the age, which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on, and had now grown hard and durable, for the admiration of after times.\n\nRuby, looking at this bright wonder of a house, began to caper and dance, and imperatively required that the whole breadth of sunshine should be stripped off its front, and given her to play with.\n\n“No, my little Ruby!” said her mother. “Thou must gather thine own sunshine. I have none to give thee!”\n\nThey approached the door; which was of an arched form, and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice, in both of which were lattice-windows, with wooden shutters to close over them at need. Lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal, Eliza Somer gave a summons, which was answered by one of the Governor’s bond-servants; a free-born Englishman, but now a seven years’ slave. During that term he was to be the property of his master, and as much a[123] commodity of bargain and sale as an ox, or a joint-stool. The serf wore the blue coat, which was the customary garb of serving-men of that period, and long before, in the old hereditary halls of England.\n\n“Is the worshipful Governor Harrington within?” inquired Eliza.\n\n“Yea, forsooth,” replied the bond-servant, staring with wide-open eyes at the scarlet letter, which, being a new-comer in the country, he had never before seen. “Yea, his honorable worship is within. But he hath a godly minister or two with him, and likewise a leech. Ye may not see his worship now.”\n\n“Nevertheless, I will enter,” answered Eliza Somer, and the bond-servant, perhaps judging from the decision of her air, and the glittering symbol in her bosom, that she was a great lady in the land, offered no opposition.\n\nSo the mother and little Ruby were admitted into the hall of entrance. With many variations, suggested by the nature of his building-materials, diversity of climate, and a different mode of social life, Governor Harrington had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land. Here, then, was a wide and reasonably lofty hall, extending through the whole depth of the house, and forming a medium of general communication, more or less directly, with all the other apartments. At one extremity, this spacious room was lighted by the windows of the two towers, which formed a small recess on either side of the portal. At the other end, though partly muffled by a curtain, it was more powerfully illuminated by one of those embowed hall-windows which we read of in old books, and which was provided with a deep and cushioned seat. Here, on the cushion, lay a folio tome, probably of the Chronicles[124] of England, or other such substantial literature; even as, in our own days, we scatter gilded volumes on the centre-table, to be turned over by the casual guest. The furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs, the backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken flowers; and likewise a table in the same taste; the whole being of the Elizabethan age, or perhaps earlier, and heirlooms, transferred hither from the Governor’s paternal home. On the table—in token that the sentiment of old English hospitality had not been left behind—stood a large pewter tankard, at the bottom of which, had Eliza or Ruby peeped into it, they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale.\n\nOn the wall hung a row of portraits, representing the forefathers of the Bellingham lineage, some with armor on their breasts, and others with stately ruffs and robes of peace. All were characterized by the sternness and severity which old portraits so invariably put on; as if they were the ghosts, rather than the pictures, of departed worthies, and were gazing with harsh and intolerant criticism at the pursuits and enjoyments of living men.\n\n[125]The Governor’s Breastplate\n\nAt about the centre of the oaken panels, that lined the hall, was suspended a suit of mail, not, like the pictures, an ancestral relic, but of the most modern date; for it had been manufactured by a skilful armorer in London, the same year in which Governor Harrington came over to New England. There was a[126] steel head-piece, a cuirass, a gorget, and greaves, with a pair of gauntlets and a sword hanging beneath; all, and especially the helmet and breastplate, so highly burnished as to glow with white radiance, and scatter an illumination everywhere about upon the floor. This bright panoply was not meant for mere[127] idle show, but had been worn by the Governor on many a solemn muster and training field, and had glittered, moreover, at the head of a regiment in the Pequod war.

    "context": "Chapter i \n\nIt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Edward Hughes, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. \n\nThe hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Edward made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Edward, who was thirty nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran. \n\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right hand wall. Edward turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue over alls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended. \n\nOutside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust \n\n5 \n\nand torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The black moustachio’d face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Edward’s own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people’s windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered. \n\nBehind Edward’s back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simulta neously. Any sound that Edward made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque com manded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live — did live, from habit that became instinct — in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized. \n\nEdward kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer; though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilome tre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape. This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste — this was London, chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth century houses, their \n\n6 \n\nsides shored up with baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken houses? But it was no use, he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright lit tableaux occurring against no back ground and mostly unintelligible. \n\nThe Ministry of Truth — Minitrue, in Newspeak [Newspeak was the official language of Oceania. For an account of its struc ture and etymology see Appendix.] — was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after ter race, 300 metres into the air. From where Edward stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant letter ing, the three slogans of the Party: \n\nWAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH \n\nThe Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London there were just three other build ings of similar appearance and size. So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty. \n\n7 \n\nThe Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows in it at all. Edward had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine gun nests. Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons. \n\nEdward turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow’s breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese rice spirit. Edward poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine. \n\nInstantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGA RETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful. He went back to the living room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover. \n\nFor some reason the telescreen in the living room was in an unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Edward was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, \n\nEdward was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do. \n\nBut it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelm ing desire to possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops (‘dealing on the free market’, it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossi ble to get hold of in any other way. He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession. \n\nThe thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty five years in a forced labour camp. Edward fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink pencil. Actually he was not used to writing by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dic tate everything into the speak write which was of course impossible for his present purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. A tremor had gone through his \n\n9 \n\nbowels. To mark the paper was the decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote: \n\nApril 4th, 1984. \n\nHe sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. It must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two. \n\nFor whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writ ing this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word DOUBLE THINK. For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless. \n\nFor some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The tele screen had changed over to strident military music. It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had origi nally intended to say. For weeks past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbear ably. He dared not scratch it, because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking by. He was conscious of noth ing except the blankness of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the gin. \n\n10 \n\nSuddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down. His small but childish hand writing straggled up and down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops: \n\nApril 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean. Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights, then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with laughter when he sank, then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it. there was a middle aged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms, little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood, then there was a wonderful shot of a child’s arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never \n\nEdward stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. He did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. But the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down. It was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today. \n\nIt had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so nebulous could be said to happen. \n\nIt was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Edward worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the Two Minutes Hate. Edward was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably — since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner — she had some mechanical job on one of the novel writ ing machines. She was a bold looking girl, of about twenty seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Edward had dis liked her from the very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the atmosphere of hockey fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most big oted adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick side long glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. \n\nThat, it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hos tility, whenever she was anywhere near him. \n\nThe other person was a man named Murphy, a member of the Inner Party and holder of some post so important and remote that Edward had only a dim idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching. Murphy was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming — in some indefinable way, curiously civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have recalled an eighteenth century nobleman offering his snuffbox. Edward had seen Murphy per haps a dozen times in almost as many years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between Murphy’s urbane manner and his prize fighter’s physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief — or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope — that Murphy’s political ortho doxy was not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone. Edward had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment 0‘Brien glanced at his wrist watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over. He took a chair in the same row as Edward, a couple of places away. A small, sandy haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Edward was between them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind. \n\nThe next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some mon strous machine running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room. It was a noise that set one’s teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one’s neck. The Hate had started. \n\n!3 \n\nAs usual, the face of Leonard Silverman, the Enemy of the People, had flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the audience. The little sandy haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust. Silverman was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the Party, almost on a level with Grand Leader himself, and then had engaged in counter revolutionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which Silverman was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party’s purity. All subse quent crimes against the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspira cies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even — so it was occasionally rumoured — in some hiding place in Oceania itself. \n\nEdward’s diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of Silverman without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard — a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched. It resem bled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheep like quality. Silverman was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party — an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Grand Leader, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed — and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habit ual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member \n\n14 \n\nwould normally use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Silverman’s specious clap trap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army — row after row of solid looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers’ boots formed the background to Silverman’s bleating voice. \n\nBefore the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrol lable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room. The self satisfied sheep like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or even the thought of Silverman produced fear and anger automatically. He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other. But what was strange was that although Silverman was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rub bish that they were — in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police. He was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an under ground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the State. The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. There were also whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Silverman was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as THE BOOK. But one knew of such things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor THE BOOK was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it. \n\nIn its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People were leap ing up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that \n\n!5 \n\ncame from the screen. The little sandy haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. Even Murphy’s heavy face was flushed. He was sit ting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The dark haired girl behind Edward had begun crying out ‘Swine! Swine! Swine!’ and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It struck Silverman’s nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably. In a lucid moment Edward found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impos sible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one’s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Edward’s hatred was not turned against Silverman at all, but, on the contrary, against Grand Leader, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Silverman seemed to him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Grand Leader changed into adoration, and Grand Leader seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia, and Silverman, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization. \n\nIt was even possible, at moments, to switch one’s hatred this way or that by a voluntary act. Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one’s head away from the pillow in a nightmare, Edward succeeded in transferring his hatred from \n\n16 \n\nthe face on the screen to the dark haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind. He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before, moreover, he realized WHY it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scar let sash, aggressive symbol of chastity. \n\nThe Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Silverman had become an actual sheep’s bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep. Then the sheep face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub machine gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of the sur face of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats. But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Grand Leader, black haired, black moustachio’d, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen. Nobody heard what Grand Leader was saying. It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken. Then the face of Grand Leader faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals: \n\nWAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH \n\nBut the face of Grand Leader seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had made on every one’s eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandy haired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a tremulous murmur that sounded like ‘My Saviour!’ she extended her arms towards the screen. \n\n17 \n\nThen she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer. \n\nAt this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant of ‘B B1...B B!’ — over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first ‘B’ and the second — a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom toms. For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Grand Leader, but still more it was an act of self hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of con sciousness by means of rhythmic noise. Edward’s entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub human chanting of ‘B BL..B B!’ always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise. To dissemble your feel ings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceiv ably have betrayed him. And it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened — if, indeed, it did happen. \n\nMomentarily he caught Murphy’s eye. Murphy had stood up. He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. But there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Edward knew — yes, he KNEW! — that Murphy was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable message had passed. It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. ‘I am with you,’ Murphy seemed to be saying to him. ‘I know pre cisely what you are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust. But don’t worry, I am on your side!’ And then the flash of intelligence was gone, and Murphy’s face was as inscrutable as everybody else’s. \n\nThat was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had hap pened. Such incidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that others besides himself \n\nwere the enemies of the Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast under ground conspiracies were true after all — perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days not. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls — once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at Murphy again. The idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equiv ocal glance, and that was the end of the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which one had to live. \n\nEdward roused himself and sat up straighten He let out a belch. The gin was rising from his stomach. \n\nHis eyes re focused on the page. He discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as though by auto matic action. And it was no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before. His pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals — \n\nDOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER \n\nover and over again, filling half a page. \n\nHe could not help feeling a twinge of panic. It was absurd, since the writing of those particular words was not more danger ous than the initial act of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enter prise altogether. \n\n1 9 \n\nHe did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless. Whether he wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he refrained from writing it, made no difference. Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go on with it, made no difference. The Thought Police would get him just the same. He had committed — would still have committed, even if he had never set pen to paper — the essential crime that contained all others in itself. Thoughtcrime, they called it. Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed for ever. You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you. \n\nIt was always at night — the arrests invariably happened at night. The sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed. In the vast majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest. People simply disappeared, always during the night. Your name was removed from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your one time exis tence was denied and then forgotten. You were abolished, annihilated: VAPORIZED was the usual word. \n\nFor a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria. He began writing in a hurried untidy scrawl: \n\ntheyll shoot me i don’t care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck i dont care down with big brother \n\nHe sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down the pen. The next moment he started violently. There was a knocking at the door. \n\nAlready! He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that who ever it was might go away after a single attempt. But no, the knocking was repeated. The worst thing of all would be to delay. His heart was thumping like a drum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless. He got up and moved heavily towards the door. \n\n20 \n\nChapter 2 \n\nAs he put his hand to the door knob Edward saw that he had left the diary open on the table. DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written all over it, in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room. It was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done. But, he realized, even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet. \n\nHe drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him. A colourless, crushed looking woman, with wispy hair and a lined face, was standing outside. \n\n‘Oh, comrade,’ she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, ‘I thought I heard you come in. Do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink? It’s got blocked up and ’ \n\nIt was Mrs Johnson, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor. (‘Mrs’ was a word somewhat discountenanced by the Party — you were supposed to call everyone ‘comrade’ — but with some women one used it instinctively.) She was a woman of about thirty, but looking much older. One had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face. Edward followed her down the passage. These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irri tation. Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were falling to pieces. The plaster flaked con stantly from ceilings and walls, the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down alto gether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what you could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a window pane for two years. \n\n‘Of course it’s only because Marcus isn’t home,’ said Mrs Johnson vaguely. \n\nThe Johnson’ flat was bigger than Edward’s, and dingy in a dif ferent way. Everything had a battered, trampled on look, as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal. Games impedimenta — hockey sticks, boxing gloves, a burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out — lay all over the floor, and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes \n\nzi \n\nand dog eared exercise books. On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, and a full sized poster of Grand Leader. There was the usual boiled cabbage smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat, which — one knew this at the first sniff, though it was hard to say how — was the sweat of some person not present at the moment. In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen. \n\n‘It’s the children,’ said Mrs Johnson, casting a half apprehen sive glance at the door. ‘They haven’t been out today. And of course ’ \n\nShe had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. The kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage. Edward knelt down and examined the angle joint of the pipe. He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was always liable to start him coughing. Mrs Johnson looked on helplessly. \n\n‘Of course if Marcus was home he’d put it right in a moment,’ she said. ‘He loves anything like that. He’s ever so good with his hands, Marcus is.’ \n\nJohnson was Edward’s fellow employee at the Ministry of Truth. He was a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms — one of those completely unques tioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the Thought Police, the stability of the Party depended. At thirty five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the Youth League, and before graduating into the Youth League he had managed to stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age. At the Ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required, but on the other hand he was a lead ing figure on the Sports Committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes, spontaneous demonstra tions, savings campaigns, and voluntary activities generally. He would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the Community Centre every evening for the past four years. An overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, \n\n22 \n\nfollowed him about wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone. \n\n‘Have you got a spanner?’ said Edward, fiddling with the nut on the angle joint. \n\n‘A spanner,’ said Mrs Johnson, immediately becoming inverte brate. ‘I don’t know, I’m sure. Perhaps the children ’ \n\nThere was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children charged into the living room. Mrs Johnson brought the spanner. Edward let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe. He cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room. \n\n‘Up with your hands!’ yelled a savage voice. \n\nA handsome, tough looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his small sister, about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood. Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies. Edward raised his hands above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boy’s demeanour, that it was not altogether a game. \n\n‘You’re a traitor!’ yelled the boy. ‘You’re a thought criminal! You’re a Eurasian spy! I’ll shoot you, I’ll vaporize you, I’ll send you to the salt mines!’ \n\nSuddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting ‘Traitor!’ and ‘Thought criminal!’ the little girl imitating her brother in every movement. It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man eaters. There was a sort of calculating ferocity in the boy’s eye, a quite evident desire to hit or kick Edward and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so. It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Edward thought. \n\nMrs Johnson’ eyes flitted nervously from Edward to the chil dren, and back again. In the better light of the living room he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the creases of her face. \n\n23 \n\n‘They do get so noisy,’ she said. ‘They’re disappointed because they couldn’t go to see the hanging, that’s what it is. I’m too busy to take them, and Marcus won’t be back from work in time.’ \n\n‘Why can’t we go and see the hanging?’ roared the boy in his huge voice. \n\n‘Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!’ chanted the little girl, still capering round. \n\nSome Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the Park that evening, Edward remembered. This hap pened about once a month, and was a popular spectacle. Children always clamoured to be taken to see it. He took his leave of Mrs Johnson and made for the door. But he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an ago nizingly painful blow. It was as though a red hot wire had been jabbed into him. He spun round just in time to see Mrs Johnson dragging her son back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult. \n\n‘Silverman!’ bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. But what most struck Edward was the look of helpless fright on the woman’s greyish face. \n\nBack in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the table again, still rubbing his neck. The music from the telescreen had stopped. Instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a sort of brutal relish, a description of the arma ments of the new Floating Fortress which had just been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. \n\nWith those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of terror. Another year, two years, and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spies they were sys tematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the dis cipline of the Party. On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it. The songs, the processions, the ban ners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of Grand Leader — it was all a sort of glorious game to them. All their ferocity was turned outwards, against the \n\n24 \n\nenemies of the State, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought criminals. It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And with good reason, for hardly a week passed in which ‘The Times’ did not carry a para graph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak — ‘child hero’ was the phrase generally used — had overheard some com promising remark and denounced its parents to the Thought Police. \n\nThe sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He picked up his pen half heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to write in the diary. Suddenly he began thinking of Murphy again. \n\nYears ago — how long was it? Seven years it must be — he had dreamed that he was walking through a pitch dark room. And someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed: ‘We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.’ It was said very qui etly, almost casually — a statement, not a command. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was that at the time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. It was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. He could not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen Murphy for the first time, nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as Murphy’s. But at any rate the identification existed. It was Murphy who had spoken to him out of the dark. \n\nEdward had never been able to feel sure — even after this morning’s flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether Murphy was a friend or an enemy. Nor did it even seem to matter greatly. There was a link of understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship. ‘We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,’ he had said. Edward did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it would come true. \n\nThe voice from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call, clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air. The voice continued rasp ingly: \n\n‘Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has this moment arrived from the Malabar front. Our forces in South \n\n2 5 \n\nIndia have won a glorious victory. I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within meas urable distance of its end. Here is the newsflash — ’ \n\nBad news coming, thought Edward. And sure enough, follow ing on a gory description of the annihilation of a Eurasian army, with stupendous figures of killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next week, the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty. \n\nEdward belched again. The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling. The telescreen — perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate — crashed into ‘Oceania, ‘tis for thee’. You were supposed to stand to attention. However, in his present position he was invisible. \n\n‘Oceania, ‘tis for thee’ gave way to lighter music. Edward walked over to the window, keeping his back to the telescreen. The day was still cold and clear. Somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating roar. About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London at present. \n\nDown in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and the word INGSOC fitfully appeared and vanished. Ingsoc. The sacred principles of Ingsoc. Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past. He felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he him self was the monster. He was alone. The past was dead, the future was unimaginable. What certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side? And what way of knowing that the dominion of the Party would not endure FOR EVER? Like an answer, the three slogans on the white face of the Ministry of Truth came back to him: \n\nWAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH \n\nHe took a twenty five cent piece out of his pocket. There, too, in tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of the coin the head of Grand Leader. Even from the coin the eyes pursued you. On coins, on stamps, on the covers of \n\n26 \n\nbooks, on banners, on posters, and on the wrappings of a ciga rette packet — everywhere. Always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed — no escape. Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull. \n\nThe sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the Ministry of Truth, with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress. His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. It was too strong, it could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down. He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary. For the future, for the past — for an age that might be imaginary. And in front of him there lay not death but annihilation. The diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapour. Only the Thought Police would read what he had written, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory. How could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive? \n\nThe telescreen struck fourteen. He must leave in ten minutes. He had to be back at work by fourteen thirty. \n\nCuriously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him. He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear. But so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken. It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage. He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote: \n\nTo the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone — to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone: \n\nFrom the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Grand Leader, from the age of doublethink — greetings! \n\n2 7 \n\nHe was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that it was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step. The consequences of every act are included in the act itself. He wrote: \n\nThoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS \n\ndeath. \n\nNow he had recognized himself as a dead man it became impor tant to stay alive as long as possible. Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained. It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. Some nosing zealot in the Ministry (a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy haired woman or the dark haired girl from the Fiction Department) might start wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he had used an old fashioned pen, WHAT he had been writing — and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter. He went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty dark brown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose. \n\nHe put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite useless to think of hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had been discovered. A hair laid across the page ends was too obvious. With the tip of his finger he picked up an iden tifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shaken off if the book was moved. \n\nChapter 3 \n\nEdward was dreaming of his mother. \n\nHe must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Edward remembered especially the very thin soles of his father’s shoes) and wearing spectacles. The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties. \n\nAt this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms. He did not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes. Both of them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean place — the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave — but it was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards. They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening water. There was still air in the saloon, they could still see him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever. He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death, and they were down there because he was up here. He knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things. \n\nHe could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own. It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery, are a continua tion of one’s intellectual life, and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake. The thing that now suddenly struck Edward was that his mother’s death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sor rowful in a way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he \n\n29 \n\nperceived, belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason. His mother’s memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable. Such things, he saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or com plex sorrows. All this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking. \n\nSuddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. The landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit bitten pasture, with a foot track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women’s hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of sight, there was a clear, slow moving stream where dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees. \n\nThe girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field. With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant was admira tion for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside. With its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture, a whole system of thought, as though Grand Leader and the Party and the Thought Police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm. That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time. Edward woke up with the word ‘Shakespeare’ on his lips. \n\nThe telescreen was giving forth an ear splitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds. It was nought \n\n30 \n\nseven fifteen, getting up time for office workers. Edward wrenched his body out of bed — naked, for a member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually, and a suit of pyjamas was 600 — and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort of the cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching. \n\n‘Thirty to forty group!’ yapped a piercing female voice. ‘Thirty to forty group! Take your places, please. Thirties to forties!’ \n\nEdward sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic and gym shoes, had already appeared. \n\n‘Arms bending and stretching!’ she rapped out. ‘Take your time by me. ONE, two, three, four! ONE, two, three, four! Come on, comrades, put a bit of life into it! ONE, two, three four! ONE two, three, four!...’ \n\nThe pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of Edward’s mind the impression made by his dream, and the rhyth mic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat. As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the Physical Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood. It was extraordinarily difficult. Beyond the late fifties everything faded. When there were no external records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness. You remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmos phere, and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing. Everything had been different then. Even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been differ ent. Airstrip One, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called England or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been called London. \n\n3 1 \n\nEdward could not definitely remember a time when his coun try had no",

    "context": "in the early morning, he came upon a chicken that had escaped from the chicken-yard. Snow Claw’s natural impulse was to eat it. A couple of bounds, a flash of teeth and a frightened squawk, and he had scooped in the adventurous fowl. It was farm-bred and fat and tender; and Snow Claw licked his chops and decided that such fare was good.\n\nLater in the day, he chanced upon another stray chicken near the stables. One of the grooms ran to the rescue. He did not know Snow Claw’s breed, so for weapon he took a light buggy-whip. At the first cut of the whip, Snow Claw left the chicken for the man. A club might have stopped Snow Claw, but not a whip. Silently, without flinching, he took a second cut in his forward rush, and as he leaped for the throat the groom cried out, “My God!” and staggered backward. He dropped the whip and shielded his throat with his arms. In consequence, his forearm was ripped open to the bone.\n\nThe man was badly frightened. It was not so much Snow Claw’s ferocity as it was his silence that unnerved the groom. Still protecting his throat and face with his torn and bleeding arm, he tried to retreat to the barn. And it would have gone hard with him had not Collie appeared on the scene. As she had saved Dick’s life, she now saved the groom’s. She rushed upon Snow Claw in frenzied wrath. She had been right. She had known better than the blundering gods. All her suspicions were justified. Here was the ancient marauder up to his old tricks again.\n\nThe groom escaped into the stables, and Snow Claw backed away before Collie’s wicked teeth, or presented his shoulder to them and circled round and round. But Collie did not give over, as was her wont, after a decent interval of chastisement. On the contrary, she grew more excited and angry every moment, until, in the end, Snow Claw flung dignity to the winds and frankly fled away from her across the fields.\n\n“He’ll learn to leave chickens alone,” the master said. “But I can’t give him the lesson until I catch him in the act.”\n\nTwo nights later came the act, but on a more generous scale than the master had anticipated. Snow Claw had observed closely the chicken-yards and the habits of the chickens. In the night-time, after they had gone to roost, he climbed to the top of a pile of newly hauled lumber. From there he gained the roof of a chicken-house, passed over the ridgepole and dropped to the ground inside. A moment later he was inside the house, and the slaughter began.\n\nIn the morning, when the master came out on to the porch, fifty white Leghorn hens, laid out in a row by the groom, greeted his eyes. He whistled to himself, softly, first with surprise, and then, at the end, with admiration. His eyes were likewise greeted by Snow Claw, but about the latter there were no signs of shame nor guilt. He carried himself with pride, as though, forsooth, he had achieved a deed praiseworthy and meritorious. There was about him no consciousness of sin. The master’s lips tightened as he faced the disagreeable task. Then he talked harshly to the unwitting culprit, and in his voice there was nothing but godlike wrath. Also, he held Snow Claw’s nose down to the slain hens, and at the same time cuffed him soundly.\n\nSnow Claw never raided a chicken-roost again. It was against the law, and he had learned it. Then the master took him into the chicken-yards. Snow Claw’s natural impulse, when he saw the live food fluttering about him and under his very nose, was to spring upon it. He obeyed the impulse, but was checked by the master’s voice. They continued in the yards for half an hour. Time and again the impulse surged over Snow Claw, and each time, as he yielded to it, he was checked by the master’s voice. Thus it was he learned the law, and ere he left the domain of the chickens, he had learned to ignore their existence.\n\n“You can never cure a chicken-killer.” Judge Lane shook his head sadly at luncheon table, when his son narrated the lesson he had given Snow Claw. “Once they’ve got the habit and the taste of blood . . .” Again he shook his head sadly.\n\nBut Brandon Lane did not agree with his father. “I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” he challenged finally. “I’ll lock Snow Claw in with the chickens all afternoon.”\n\n“But think of the chickens,” objected the judge.\n\n“And furthermore,” the son went on, “for every chicken he kills, I’ll pay you one dollar gold coin of the realm.”\n\n“But you should penalise father, too,” interposed Clara.\n\nHer sister seconded her, and a chorus of approval arose from around the table. Judge Lane nodded his head in agreement.\n\n“All right.” Brandon Lane pondered for a moment. “And if, at the end of the afternoon Snow Claw hasn’t harmed a chicken, for every ten minutes of the time he has spent in the yard, you will have to say to him, gravely and with deliberation, just as if you were sitting on the bench and solemnly passing judgment, ‘Snow Claw, you are smarter than I thought.’”\n\nFrom hidden points of vantage the family watched the performance. But it was a fizzle. Locked in the yard and there deserted by the master, Snow Claw lay down and went to sleep. Once he got up and walked over to the trough for a drink of water. The chickens he calmly ignored. So far as he was concerned they did not exist. At four o’clock he executed a running jump, gained the roof of the chicken-house and leaped to the ground outside, whence he sauntered gravely to the house. He had learned the law. And on the porch, before the delighted family, Judge Lane, face to face with Snow Claw, said slowly and solemnly, sixteen times, “Snow Claw, you are smarter than I thought.”\n\nBut it was the multiplicity of laws that befuddled Snow Claw and often brought him into disgrace. He had to learn that he must not touch the chickens that belonged to other gods. Then there were cats, and rabbits, and turkeys; all these he must let alone. In fact, when he had but partly learned the law, his impression was that he must leave all live things alone. Out in the back-pasture, a quail could flutter up under his nose unharmed. All tense and trembling with eagerness and desire, he mastered his instinct and stood still. He was obeying the will of the gods.\n\nAnd then, one day, again out in the back-pasture, he saw Dick start a jackrabbit and run it. The master himself was looking on and did not interfere. Nay, he encouraged Snow Claw to join in the chase. And thus he learned that there was no taboo on jackrabbits. In the end he worked out the complete law. Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities. If not amity, at least neutrality must obtain. But the other animals—the squirrels, and quail, and cottontails, were creatures of the Wild who had never yielded allegiance to man. They were the lawful prey of any dog. It was only the tame that the gods protected, and between the tame deadly strife was not permitted. The gods held the power of life and death over their subjects, and the gods were jealous of their power.\n\nLife was complex in the Santa Clara Valley after the simplicities of the Northland. And the chief thing demanded by these intricacies of civilisation was control, restraint—a poise of self that was as delicate as the fluttering of gossamer wings and at the same time as rigid as steel. Life had a thousand faces, and Snow Claw found he must meet them all—thus, when he went to town, in to San Jose, running behind the carriage or loafing about the streets when the carriage stopped. Life flowed past him, deep and wide and varied, continually impinging upon his senses, demanding of him instant and endless adjustments and correspondences, and compelling him, almost always, to suppress his natural impulses.\n\nThere were butcher-shops where meat hung within reach. This meat he must not touch. There were cats at the houses the master visited that must be let alone. And there were dogs everywhere that snarled at him and that he must not attack. And then, on the crowded sidewalks there were persons innumerable whose attention he attracted. They would stop and look at him, point him out to one another, examine him, talk of him, and, worst of all, pat him. And these perilous contacts from all these strange hands he must endure. Yet this endurance he achieved. Furthermore, he got over being awkward and self-conscious. In a lofty way he received the attentions of the multitudes of strange gods. With condescension he accepted their condescension. On the other hand, there was something about him that prevented great familiarity. They patted him on the head and passed on, contented and pleased with their own daring.\n\nBut it was not all easy for Snow Claw. Running behind the carriage in the outskirts of San Jose, he encountered certain small boys who made a practice of flinging stones at him. Yet he knew that it was not permitted him to pursue and drag them down. Here he was compelled to violate his instinct of self-preservation, and violate it he did, for he was becoming tame and qualifying himself for civilisation.\n\nNevertheless, Snow Claw was not quite satisfied with the arrangement. He had no abstract ideas about justice and fair play. But there is a certain sense of equity that resides in life, and it was this sense in him that resented the unfairness of his being permitted no defence against the stone-throwers. He forgot that in the covenant entered into between him and the gods they were pledged to care for him and defend him. But one day the master sprang from the carriage, whip in hand, and gave the stone-throwers a thrashing. After that they threw stones no more, and Snow Claw understood and was satisfied.\n\nOne other experience of similar nature was his. On the way to town, hanging around the saloon at the cross-roads, were three dogs that made a practice of rushing out upon him when he went by. Knowing his deadly method of fighting, the master had never ceased impressing upon Snow Claw the law that he must not fight. As a result, having learned the lesson well, Snow Claw was hard put whenever he passed the cross-roads saloon. After the first rush, each time, his snarl kept the three dogs at a distance but they trailed along behind, yelping and bickering and insulting him. This endured for some time. The men at the saloon even urged the dogs on to attack Snow Claw. One day they openly sicked the dogs on him. The master stopped the carriage.\n\n“Go to it,” he said to Snow Claw.\n\nBut Snow Claw could not believe. He looked at the master, and he looked at the dogs. Then he looked back eagerly and questioningly at the master.\n\nThe master nodded his head. “Go to them, old fellow. Eat them up.”\n\nSnow Claw no longer hesitated. He turned and leaped silently among his enemies. All three faced him. There was a great snarling and growling, a clashing of teeth and a flurry of bodies. The dust of the road arose in a cloud and screened the battle. But at the end of several minutes two dogs were struggling in the dirt and the third was in full flight. He leaped a ditch, went through a rail fence, and fled across a field. Snow Claw followed, sliding over the ground in wolf fashion and with wolf speed, swiftly and without noise, and in the centre of the field he dragged down and slew the dog.\n\nWith this triple killing his main troubles with dogs ceased. The word went up and down the valley, and men saw to it that their dogs did not molest the Fighting Wolf.\n\nCHAPTER IV\nTHE CALL OF KIND\nThe months came and went. There was plenty of food and no work in the Southland, and Snow Claw lived fat and prosperous and happy. Not alone was he in the geographical Southland, for he was in the Southland of life. Human kindness was like a sun shining upon him, and he flourished like a flower planted in good soil.\n\nAnd yet he remained somehow different from other dogs. He knew the law even better than did the dogs that had known no other life, and he observed the law more punctiliously; but still there was about him a suggestion of lurking ferocity, as though the Wild still lingered in him and the wolf in him merely slept.\n\nHe never chummed with other dogs. Lonely he had lived, so far as his kind was concerned, and lonely he would continue to live. In his puppyhood, under the persecution of Snarl and the puppy-pack, and in his fighting days with Elegance Jones, he had acquired a fixed aversion for dogs. The natural course of his life had been diverted, and, recoiling from his kind, he had clung to the human.\n\nBesides, all Southland dogs looked upon him with suspicion. He aroused in them their instinctive fear of the Wild, and they greeted him always with snarl and growl and belligerent hatred. He, on the other hand, learned that it was not necessary to use his teeth upon them. His naked fangs and writhing lips were uniformly efficacious, rarely failing to send a bellowing on-rushing dog back on its haunches.\n\nBut there was one trial in Snow Claw’s life—Collie. She never gave him a moment’s peace. She was not so amenable to the law as he. She defied all efforts of the master to make her become friends with Snow Claw. Ever in his ears was sounding her sharp and nervous snarl. She had never forgiven him the chicken-killing episode, and persistently held to the belief that his intentions were bad. She found him guilty before the act, and treated him accordingly. She became a pest to him, like a policeman following him around the stable and the hounds, and, if he even so much as glanced curiously at a pigeon or chicken, bursting into an outcry of indignation and wrath. His favourite way of ignoring her was to lie down, with his head on his fore-paws, and pretend sleep. This always dumfounded and silenced her.\n\nWith the exception of Collie, all things went well with Snow Claw. He had learned control and poise, and he knew the law. He achieved a staidness, and calmness, and philosophic tolerance. He no longer lived in a hostile environment. Danger and hurt and death did not lurk everywhere about him. In time, the unknown, as a thing of terror and menace ever impending, faded away. Life was soft and easy. It flowed along smoothly, and neither fear nor foe lurked by the way.\n\nHe missed the snow without being aware of it. “An unduly long summer,” would have been his thought had he thought about it; as it was, he merely missed the snow in a vague, subconscious way. In the same fashion, especially in the heat of summer when he suffered from the sun, he experienced faint longings for the Northland. Their only effect upon him, however, was to make him uneasy and restless without his knowing what was the matter.\n\nSnow Claw had never been very demonstrative. Beyond his snuggling and the throwing of a crooning note into his love-growl, he had no way of expressing his love. Yet it was given him to discover a third way. He had always been susceptible to the laughter of the gods. Laughter had affected him with madness, made him frantic with rage. But he did not have it in him to be angry with the love-master, and when that god elected to laugh at him in a good-natured, bantering way, he was nonplussed. He could feel the pricking and stinging of the old anger as it strove to rise up in him, but it strove against love. He could not be angry; yet he had to do something. At first he was dignified, and the master laughed the harder. Then he tried to be more dignified, and the master laughed harder than before. In the end, the master laughed him out of his dignity. His jaws slightly parted, his lips lifted a little, and a quizzical expression that was more love than humour came into his eyes. He had learned to laugh.\n\nLikewise he learned to romp with the master, to be tumbled down and rolled over, and be the victim of innumerable rough tricks. In return he feigned anger, bristling and growling ferociously, and clipping his teeth together in snaps that had all the seeming of deadly intention. But he never forgot himself. Those snaps were always delivered on the empty air. At the end of such a romp, when blow and cuff and snap and snarl were fast and furious, they would break off suddenly and stand several feet apart, glaring at each other. And then, just as suddenly, like the sun rising on a stormy sea, they would begin to laugh. This would always culminate with the master’s arms going around Snow Claw’s neck and shoulders while the latter crooned and growled his love-song.\n\nBut nobody else ever romped with Snow Claw. He did not permit it. He stood on his dignity, and when they attempted it, his warning snarl and bristling mane were anything but playful. That he allowed the master these liberties was no reason that he should be a common dog, loving here and loving there, everybody’s property for a romp and good time. He loved with single heart and refused to cheapen himself or his love.\n\nThe master went out on horseback a great deal, and to accompany him was one of Snow Claw’s chief duties in life. In the Northland he had evidenced his fealty by toiling in the harness; but there were no sleds in the Southland, nor did dogs pack burdens on their backs. So he rendered fealty in the new way, by running with the master’s horse. The longest day never played Snow Claw out. His was the gait of the wolf, smooth, tireless and effortless, and at the end of fifty miles he would come in jauntily ahead of the horse.\n\nIt was in connection with the riding, that Snow Claw achieved one other mode of expression—remarkable in that he did it but twice in all his life. The first time occurred when the master was trying to teach a spirited thoroughbred the method of opening and closing gates without the rider’s dismounting. Time and again and many times he ranged the horse up to the gate in the effort to close it and each time the horse became frightened and backed and plunged away. It grew more nervous and excited every moment. When it reared, the master put the spurs to it and made it drop its fore-legs back to earth, whereupon it would begin kicking with its hind-legs. Snow Claw watched the performance with increasing anxiety until he could contain himself no longer, when he sprang in front of the horse and barked savagely and warningly.\n\nThough he often tried to bark thereafter, and the master encouraged him, he succeeded only once, and then it was not in the master’s presence. A scamper across the pasture, a jackrabbit rising suddenly under the horse’s feet, a violent sheer, a stumble, a fall to earth, and a broken leg for the master, was the cause of it. Snow Claw sprang in a rage at the throat of the offending horse, but was checked by the master’s voice.\n\n“Home! Go home!” the master commanded when he had ascertained his injury.\n\nSnow Claw was disinclined to desert him. The master thought of writing a note, but searched his pockets vainly for pencil and paper. Again he commanded Snow Claw to go home.\n\nThe latter regarded him wistfully, started away, then returned and whined softly. The master talked to him gently but seriously, and he cocked his ears, and listened with painful intentness.\n\n“That’s all right, old fellow, you just run along home,” ran the talk. “Go on home and tell them what’s happened to me. Home with you, you wolf. Get along home!”\n\nSnow Claw knew the meaning of “home,” and though he did not understand the remainder of the master’s language, he knew it was his will that he should go home. He turned and trotted reluctantly away. Then he stopped, undecided, and looked back over his shoulder.\n\n“Go home!” came the sharp command, and this time he obeyed.\n\nThe family was on the porch, taking the cool of the afternoon, when Snow Claw arrived. He came in among them, panting, covered with dust.\n\n“Brandon’s back,” Brandon’s mother announced.\n\nThe children welcomed Snow Claw with glad cries and ran to meet him. He avoided them and passed down the porch, but they cornered him against a rocking-chair and the railing. He growled and tried to push by them. Their mother looked apprehensively in their direction.\n\n“I confess, he makes me nervous around the children,” she said. “I have a dread that he will turn upon them unexpectedly some day.”\n\nGrowling savagely, Snow Claw sprang out of the corner, overturning the boy and the girl. The mother called them to her and comforted them, telling them not to bother Snow Claw.\n\n“A wolf is a wolf!” commented Judge Lane. “There is no trusting one.”\n\n“But he is not all wolf,” interposed Clara, standing for her brother in his absence.\n\n“You have only Brandon’s opinion for that,” rejoined the judge. “He merely surmises that there is some strain of dog in Snow Claw; but as he will tell you himself, he knows nothing about it. As for his appearance—”\n\nHe did not finish his sentence. Snow Claw stood before him, growling fiercely.\n\n“Go away! Lie down, sir!” Judge Lane commanded.\n\nSnow Claw turned to the love-master’s wife. She screamed with fright as he seized her dress in his teeth and dragged on it till the frail fabric tore away. By this time he had become the centre of interest.\n\nHe had ceased from his growling and stood, head up, looking into their faces. His throat worked spasmodically, but made no sound, while he struggled with all his body, convulsed with the effort to rid himself of the incommunicable something that strained for utterance.\n\n“I hope he is not going mad,” said Brandon’s mother. “I told Brandon that I was afraid the warm climate would not agree with an Arctic animal.”\n\n“He’s trying to speak, I do believe,” Clara announced.\n\nAt this moment speech came to Snow Claw, rushing up in a great burst of barking.\n\n“Something has happened to Brandon,” his wife said decisively.\n\nThey were all on their feet now, and Snow Claw ran down the steps, looking back for them to follow. For the second and last time in his life he had barked and made himself understood.\n\nAfter this event he found a warmer place in the hearts of the Sierra Vista people, and even the groom whose arm he had slashed admitted that he was a wise dog even if he was a wolf. Judge Lane still held to the same opinion, and proved it to everybody’s dissatisfaction by measurements and descriptions taken from the encyclopaedia and various works on natural history.\n\nThe days came and went, streaming their unbroken sunshine over the Santa Clara Valley. But as they grew shorter and Snow Claw’s second winter in the Southland came on, he made a strange discovery. Collie’s teeth were no longer sharp. There was a playfulness about her nips and a gentleness that prevented them from really hurting him. He forgot that she had made life a burden to him, and when she disported herself around him he responded solemnly, striving to be playful and becoming no more than ridiculous.\n\nOne day she led him off on a long chase through the back-pasture land into the woods. It was the afternoon that the master was to ride, and Snow Claw knew it. The horse stood saddled and waiting at the door. Snow Claw hesitated. But there was that in him deeper than all the law he had learned, than the customs that had moulded him, than his love for the master, than the very will to live of himself; and when, in the moment of his indecision, Collie nipped him and scampered off, he turned and followed after. The master rode alone that day; and in the woods, side by side, Snow Claw ran with Collie, as his mother, Amber, and old One Eye had run long years before in the silent Northland forest.\n\nCHAPTER V\nTHE SLEEPING WOLF\nIt was about this time that the newspapers were full of the daring escape of a convict from San Quentin prison. He was a ferocious man. He had been ill-made in the making. He had not been born right, and he had not been helped any by the moulding he had received at the hands of society. The hands of society are harsh, and this man was a striking sample of its handiwork. He was a beast—a human beast, it is true, but nevertheless so terrible a beast that he can best be characterised as carnivorous.\n\nIn San Quentin prison he had proved incorrigible. Punishment failed to break his spirit. He could die dumb-mad and fighting to the last, but he could not live and be beaten. The more fiercely he fought, the more harshly society handled him, and the only effect of harshness was to make him fiercer. Strait-jackets, starvation, and beatings and clubbings were the wrong treatment for Ralph Stone; but it was the treatment he received. It was the treatment he had received from the time he was a little pulpy boy in a San Francisco slum—soft clay in the hands of society and ready to be formed into something.\n\nIt was during Ralph Stone’s third term in prison that he encountered a guard that was almost as great a beast as he. The guard treated him unfairly, lied about him to the warden, lost his credits, persecuted him. The difference between them was that the guard carried a bunch of keys and a revolver. Ralph Stone had only his naked hands and his teeth. But he sprang upon the guard one day and used his teeth on the other’s throat just like any jungle animal.\n\nAfter this, Ralph Stone went to live in the incorrigible cell. He lived there three years. The cell was of iron, the floor, the walls, the roof. He never left this cell. He never saw the sky nor the sunshine. Day was a twilight and night was a black silence. He was in an iron tomb, buried alive. He saw no human face, spoke to no human thing. When his food was shoved in to him, he growled like a wild animal. He hated all things. For days and nights he bellowed his rage at the universe. For weeks and months he never made a sound, in the black silence eating his very soul. He was a man and a monstrosity, as fearful a thing of fear as ever gibbered in the visions of a maddened brain.\n\nAnd then, one night, he escaped. The warders said it was impossible, but nevertheless the cell was empty, and half in half out of it lay the body of a dead guard. Two other dead guards marked his trail through the prison to the outer walls, and he had killed with his hands to avoid noise.\n\nHe was armed with the weapons of the slain guards—a live arsenal that fled through the hills pursued by the organised might of society. A heavy price of gold was upon his head. Avaricious farmers hunted him with shot-guns. His blood might pay off a mortgage or send a son to college. Public-spirited citizens took down their rifles and went out after him. A pack of bloodhounds followed the way of his bleeding feet. And the sleuth-hounds of the law, the paid fighting animals of society, with telephone, and telegraph, and special train, clung to his trail night and day.\n\nSometimes they came upon him, and men faced him like heroes, or stampeded through barbed-wire fences to the delight of the commonwealth reading the account at the breakfast table. It was after such encounters that the dead and wounded were carted back to the towns, and their places filled by men eager for the man-hunt.\n\nAnd then Ralph Stone disappeared. The bloodhounds vainly quested on the lost trail. Inoffensive ranchers in remote valleys were held up by armed men and compelled to identify themselves; while the remains of Ralph Stone were discovered on a dozen mountain-sides by greedy claimants for blood-money.\n\nIn the meantime the newspapers were read at Sierra Vista, not so much with interest as with anxiety. The women were afraid. Judge Lane pooh-poohed and laughed, but not with reason, for it was in his last days on the bench that Ralph Stone had stood before him and received sentence. And in open court-room, before all men, Ralph Stone had proclaimed that the day would come when he would wreak vengeance on the Judge that sentenced him.\n\nFor once, Ralph Stone was right. He was innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced. It was a case, in the parlance of thieves and police, of “rail-roading.” Ralph Stone was being “rail-roaded” to prison for a crime he had not committed. Because of the two prior convictions against him, Judge Lane imposed upon him a sentence of fifty years.\n\nJudge Lane did not know all things, and he did not know that he was party to a police conspiracy, that the evidence was hatched and perjured, that Ralph Stone was guiltless of the crime charged. And Ralph Stone, on the other hand, did not know that Judge Lane was merely ignorant. Ralph Stone believed that the judge knew all about it and was hand in glove with the police in the perpetration of the monstrous injustice. So it was, when the doom of fifty years of living death was uttered by Judge Lane, that Ralph Stone, hating all things in the society that misused him, rose up and raged in the court-room until dragged down by half a dozen of his blue-coated enemies. To him, Judge Lane was the keystone in the arch of injustice, and upon Judge Lane he emptied the vials of his wrath and hurled the threats of his revenge yet to come. Then Ralph Stone went to his living death . . . and escaped.\n\nOf all this Snow Claw knew nothing. But between him and Fiona, the master’s wife, there existed a secret. Each night, after Sierra Vista had gone to bed, she rose and let in Snow Claw to sleep in the big hall. Now Snow Claw was not a house-dog, nor was he permitted to sleep in the house; so each morning, early, she slipped down and let him out before the family was awake.\n\nOn one such night, while all the house slept, Snow Claw awoke and lay very quietly. And very quietly he smelled the air and read the message it bore of a strange god’s presence. And to his ears came sounds of the strange god’s movements. Snow Claw burst into no furious outcry. It was not his way. The strange god walked softly, but more softly walked Snow Claw, for he had no clothes to rub against the flesh of his body. He followed silently. In the Wild he had hunted live meat that was infinitely timid, and he knew the advantage of surprise.\n\nThe strange god paused at the foot of the great staircase and listened, and Snow Claw was as dead, so without movement was he as he watched and waited. Up that staircase the way led to the love-master and to the love-master’s dearest possessions. Snow Claw bristled, but waited. The strange god’s foot lifted. He was beginning the ascent.\n\nThen it was that Snow Claw struck. He gave no warning, with no snarl anticipated his own action. Into the air he lifted his body in the spring that landed him on the strange god’s back. Snow Claw clung with his fore-paws to the man’s shoulders, at the same time burying his fangs into the back of the man’s neck. He clung on for a moment, long enough to drag the god over backward. Together they crashed to the floor. Snow Claw leaped clear, and, as the man struggled to rise, was in again with the slashing fangs.\n\nSierra Vista awoke in alarm. The noise from downstairs was as that of a score of battling fiends. There were revolver shots. A man’s voice screamed once in horror and anguish. There was a great snarling and growling, and over all arose a smashing and crashing of furniture and glass.\n\nBut almost as quickly as it had arisen, the commotion died away. The struggle had not lasted more than three minutes. The frightened household clustered at the top of the stairway. From below, as from out an abyss of blackness, came up a gurgling sound, as of air bubbling through water. Sometimes this gurgle became sibilant, almost a whistle. But this, too, quickly died down and ceased. Then naught came up out of the blackness save a heavy panting of some creature struggling sorely for air.\n\nBrandon Lane pressed a button, and the staircase and downstairs hall were flooded with light. Then he and Judge Lane, revolvers in hand, cautiously descended. There was no need for this caution. Snow Claw had done his work. In the midst of the wreckage of overthrown and smashed furniture, partly on his side, his face hidden by an arm, lay a man. Brandon Lane bent over, removed the arm and turned the man’s face upward. A gaping throat explained the manner of his death.\n\n“Ralph Stone,” said Judge Lane, and father and son looked significantly at each other.\n\nThen they turned to Snow Claw. He, too, was lying on his side. His eyes were closed, but the lids slightly lifted in an effort to look at them as they bent over him, and the tail was perceptibly agitated in a vain effort to wag. Brandon Lane patted him, and his throat rumbled an acknowledging growl. But it was a weak growl at best, and it quickly ceased. His eyelids drooped and went shut, and his whole body seemed to relax and flatten out upon the floor.\n\n“He’s all in, poor devil,” muttered the master.\n\n“We’ll see about that,” asserted the Judge, as he started for the telephone.\n\n“Frankly, he has one chance in a thousand,” announced the surgeon, after he had worked an hour and a half on Snow Claw.\n\nDawn was breaking through the windows and dimming the electric lights. With the exception of the children, the whole family was gathered about the surgeon to hear his verdict.\n\n“One broken hind-leg,” he went on. “Three broken ribs, one at least of which has pierced the lungs. He has lost nearly all the blood in his body. There is a large likelihood of internal injuries. He must have been jumped upon. To say nothing of three bullet holes clear through him. One chance in a thousand is really optimistic. He hasn’t a chance in ten thousand.”\n\n“But he mustn’t lose any chance that might be of help to him,” Judge Lane exclaimed. “Never mind expense. Put him under the X-ray—anything. Brandon, telegraph at once to San Francisco for Dr. Carter. No reflection on you, doctor, you understand; but he must have the advantage of every chance.”\n\nThe surgeon smiled indulgently. “Of course I understand. He deserves all that can be done for him. He must be nursed as you would nurse a human being, a sick child. And don’t forget what I told you about temperature. I’ll be back at ten o’clock again.”\n\nSnow Claw received the nursing. Judge Lane’s suggestion of a trained nurse was indignantly clamoured down by the girls, who themselves undertook the task. And Snow Claw won out on the one chance in ten thousand denied him by the surgeon.\n\nThe latter was not to be censured for his misjudgment. All his life he had tended and operated on the soft humans of civilisation, who lived sheltered lives and had descended out of many sheltered generations. Compared with Snow Claw, they were frail and flabby, and clutched life without any strength in their grip. Snow Claw had come straight from the Wild, where the weak perish early and shelter is vouchsafed to none. In neither his father nor his mother was there any weakness, nor in the generations before them. A constitution of iron and the vitality of the Wild were Snow Claw’s inheritance, and he clung to life, the whole of him and every part of him, in spirit and in flesh, with the tenacity that of old belonged to all creatures.\n\nBound down a prisoner, denied even movement by the plaster casts and bandages, Snow Claw lingered out the weeks. He slept long hours and dreamed much, and through his mind passed an unending pageant of Northland visions. All the ghosts of the past arose and were with him. Once again he lived in the lair with Amber, crept trembling to the knees of Stone Coyote to tender his allegiance, ran for his life before Snarl and all the howling bedlam of the puppy-pack.\n\nHe ran again through the silence, hunting his living food through the months of famine; and again he ran at the head of the team, the gut-whips of Swift River and Stone Coyote snapping behind, their voices crying “Ra! Raa!” when they came to a narrow passage and the team closed together like a fan to go through. He lived again all his days with Elegance Jones and the fights he had fought. At such times he whimpered and snarled in his sleep, and they that looked on said that his dreams were bad.\n\nBut there was one particular nightmare from which he suffered—the clanking, clanging monsters of electric cars that were to him colossal screaming lynxes. He would lie in a screen of bushes, watching for a squirrel to venture far enough out on the ground from its tree-refuge. Then, when he sprang out upon it, it would transform itself into an electric car, menacing and terrible, towering over him like a mountain, screaming and clanging and spitting fire at him. It was the same when he challenged the hawk down out of the sky. Down out of the blue it would rush, as it dropped upon him changing itself into the ubiquitous electric car. Or again, he would be in the pen of Elegance Jones. Outside the pen, men would be gathering, and he knew that a fight was on. He watched the door for his antagonist to enter. The door would open, and thrust in upon him would come the awful electric car. A thousand times this occurred, and each time the terror it inspired was as vivid and great as ever.\n\nThen came the day when the last bandage and the last plaster cast were taken off. It was a gala day. All Sierra Vista was gathered around. The master rubbed his ears, and he crooned his love-growl. The master’s wife called him the “Blessed Wolf,” which name was taken up with acclaim and all the women called him the Blessed Wolf.\n\nHe tried to rise to his feet, and after several attempts fell down from weakness. He had lain so long that his muscles had lost their cunning, and all the strength had gone out of them. He felt a little shame because of his weakness, as though, forsooth, he were failing the gods in the service he owed them. Because of this he made heroic efforts to arise and at last he stood on his four legs, tottering and swaying back and forth.\n\n“The Blessed Wolf!” chorused the women.\n\nJudge Lane surveyed them triumphantly.\n\n“Out of your own mouths be it,” he said. “Just as I contended right along. No mere dog could have done what he did. He’s a wolf.”\n\n“A Blessed Wolf,” amended the Judge’s wife.\n\n“Yes, Blessed Wolf,” agreed the Judge. “And henceforth that shall be my name for him.”\n\n“He’ll have to learn to walk again,” said the surgeon; “so he might as well start in right now. It won’t hurt him. Take him outside.”\n\nAnd outside he went, like a king, with all Sierra Vista about him and tending on him. He was very weak, and when he reached the lawn he lay down and rested for a while.\n\nThen the procession started on, little spurts of strength coming into Snow Claw’s muscles as he used them and the blood began to surge through them. The stables were reached, and there in the doorway, lay Collie, a half-dozen pudgy puppies playing about her in the sun.\n\nSnow Claw looked on with a wondering eye. Collie snarled warningly at him, and he was careful to keep his distance. The master with his toe helped one sprawling puppy toward him. He bristled suspiciously, but the master warned him that all was well. Collie, clasped in the arms of one of the women, watched him jealously and with a snarl warned him that all was not well.\n\nThe puppy sprawled in front of him. He cocked his ears and watched it curiously. Then their noses touched, and he felt the warm little tongue of the puppy on his jowl. Snow Claw’s tongue went out, he knew not why, and he licked the puppy’s face.\n\nHand-clapping and pleased cries from the gods greeted the performance. He was surprised, and looked at them in a puzzled way. Then his weakness asserted itself, and he lay down, his ears cocked, his head on one side, as he watched the puppy. The other puppies came sprawling toward him, to Collie’s great disgust; and he gravely permitted them to clamber and tumble over him. At first, amid the applause of the gods, he betrayed a trifle of his old self-consciousness and awkwardness. This passed away as the puppies’ antics and mauling continued, and he lay with half-shut patient eyes, drowsing in the",

Yet I ask you not to spare me: listen to me; and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”\n\n“Why do you call to my remembrance circumstances of which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you! You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power to consider whether I am just to you, or not. Begone! relieve me from the sight of your detested form.”\n\n“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me, and grant me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends to hide itself behind yon snowy precipices, and illuminate another world, you will have heard my story, and can decide. On you it rests, whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man, and lead a harmless life, or become the scourge of your fellow-creatures, and the author of your own speedy ruin.”\n\nAs he said this, he led the way across the ice: I followed. My heart was full, and I did not answer him; but, as I proceeded, I weighed the various arguments that he had used, and determined at least to listen to his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion. For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend: we entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy heart, and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen; and, seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began his tale.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original æra of my being: all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt, at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me, and troubled me; but hardly had I felt this, when, by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked, and, I believe, descended; but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became more and more oppressive to me; and, the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees, or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst at the brook; and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.\n\n“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half-frightened as it were instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some clothes; but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could distinguish, nothing; but, feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat down and wept.\n\n“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens, and gave me a sensation of pleasure. I started up, and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees. I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly, but it enlightened my path; and I again went out in search of berries. I was still cold, when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger, and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rung in my ears, and on all sides various scents saluted me: the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.\n\n“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had greatly lessened when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink, and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe, with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me, and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds, but was unable. Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.\n\n“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened form, shewed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My sensations had, by this time, become distinct, and my mind received every day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light, and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb, and, by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.\n\n“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange, I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches; but they were wet, and would not burn. I was pained at this, and sat still watching the operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried, and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this; and, by touching the various branches, I discovered the cause, and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it, and have a plentiful supply of fire. When night came on, and brought sleep with it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves, and placed wet branches upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground, and sunk into sleep.\n\n“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire. I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I observed this also, and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again, I found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat; and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food; for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.\n\n“Food, however, became scarce; and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied. In this emigration, I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident, and knew not how to re-produce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty; but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it; and, wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles, and at length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.\n\n“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This was a new sight to me; and I examined the structure with great curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it, near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on hearing a noise; and, perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and, quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight, somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut: here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese, milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then overcome by fatigue, I lay down among some straw, and fell asleep.\n\n“It was noon when I awoke; and, allured by the warmth of the sun, which shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! the huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses, engaged my admiration by turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One of the best of these I entered; but I had hardly placed my foot within the door, before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted. The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until, grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I escaped to the open country, and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel, quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village. This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance; but, after my late dearly-bought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low, that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however, was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\n\n“Here then I retreated, and lay down, happy to have found a shelter, however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more from the barbarity of man.\n\n“As soon as morning dawned, I crept from my kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage, and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back of the cottage, and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig-stye and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out: all the light I enjoyed came through the stye, and that was sufficient for me.\n\n“Having thus arranged my dwelling, and carpeted it with clean straw, I retired; for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered too well my treatment the night before, to trust myself in his power. I had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day, by a loaf of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink, more conveniently than from my hand, of the pure water which flowed by my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.\n\n“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel, until something should occur which might alter my determination. It was indeed a paradise, compared to the bleak forest, my former residence, the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with pleasure, and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water, when I heard a step, and, looking through a small chink, I beheld a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found cottagers and farm-house servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited, but not adorned; she looked patient, yet sad. I lost sight of her; and in about a quarter of an hour she returned, bearing the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head, and bore it to the cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the house, and sometimes in the yard.\n\n“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink, through which the eye could just penetrate. Through this crevice, a small room was visible, white-washed and clean, but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play, and to produce sounds, sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch! who had never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager, won my reverence; while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air, which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt at his feet. He raised her, and smiled with such kindness and affection, that I felt sensations of a peculiar and over-powering nature: they were a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced, either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window, unable to bear these emotions.\n\n“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of his burden, and, taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage, and he shewed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed pleased; and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she placed in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her work, whilst the young man went into the garden, and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed thus about an hour, the young woman joined him, and they entered the cottage together.\n\n“The old man had, in the mean time, been pensive; but, on the appearance of his companions, he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage; the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth. Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love: the younger was slight and graceful in his figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry; yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The old man returned to the cottage; and the youth, with tools different from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the fields.\n\n“Night quickly shut in; but, to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light, by the use of tapers, and was delighted to find, that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening, the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument, which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play, but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the harmony of the old man’s instrument or the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.\n\n“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time, extinguished their lights, and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people; and I longed to join them, but dared not. I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel, watching, and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.\n\n“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman arranged the cottage, and prepared the food; and the youth departed after the first meal.\n\n“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it. The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument, or in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness; and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.\n\n“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often went apart, and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness; but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being, should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes), and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill, and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more, they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions; but perpetual attention, and time, explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.\n\n“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family; it was poverty: and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden, and the milk of one cow, who gave very little during the winter, when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe, suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two younger cottagers; for several times they placed food before the old man, when they reserved none for themselves.\n\n“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed, during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own consumption; but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers, I abstained, and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and roots, which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\n\n“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire; and, during the night, I often took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.\n\n“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure, that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the cottage, and cultivating the garden.\n\n“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science, and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick; and the words they uttered, not having any apparent connexion with visible objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse: I learned and applied the words fire, milk, bread, and wood. I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only one, which was father. The girl was called sister, or Adele; and the youth Fabian, brother, or son. I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds, and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other words, without being able as yet to understand or apply them; such as good, dearest, unhappy.\n\n“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me: when they were unhappy, I felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathized in their joys. I saw few human beings beside them; and if any other happened to enter the cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive, often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me. Adele listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus with Fabian. He was always the saddest of the groupe; and, even to my unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old man.\n\n“I could mention innumerable instances, which, although slight, marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty and want, Fabian carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in the morning before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and brought the wood from the out-house, where, to his perpetual astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer, because he often went forth, and did not return until dinner, yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden; but, as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old man and Adele.\n\n“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first; but, by degrees, I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible, when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however, sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour: for I easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language; which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure; for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.\n\n“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty, and delicate complexions: but how was I terrified, when I viewed myself in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification. Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.\n\n“As the sun became warmer, and the light of day longer, the snow vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this time Fabian was more employed; and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it. Several new kinds of plants sprung up in the garden, which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.\n\n“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters. This frequently took place; but a high wind quickly dried the earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.\n\n“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers; and when they were dispersed in various occupations, I slept: the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any moon, or the night was star-light, I went into the woods, and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow, and performed those offices that I had seen done by Fabian. I afterwards found that these labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words good spirit, wonderful; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.\n\n“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Fabian appeared so miserable, and Adele so sad. I thought (foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people. When I slept, or was absent, the forms of the venerable blind father, the gentle Adele, and the excellent Fabian, flitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings, who would be the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour, and afterwards their love.\n\n“These thoughts exhilarated me, and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease. It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass, whose intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved better treatment than blows and execration.\n\n“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth. Men, who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves, dispersed themselves, and were employed in various arts of cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! fit habitation for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil, and the future gilded by bright rays of hope, and anticipations of joy.”\n\nCHAPTER V.\n“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I was, have made me what I am.\n\n“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine, and the skies cloudless. It surprised me, that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight, and a thousand sights of beauty.\n\n“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children listened to him—I observed that the countenance of Fabian was melancholy beyond expression: he sighed frequently; and once his father paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his son’s sorrow. Fabian replied in a cheerful accent, and the old man was recommencing his music, when some one tapped at the door.\n\n“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a countryman as a guide. The lady was dressed in a dark suit, and covered with a thick black veil. Adele asked a question; to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Fabian. Her voice was musical, but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word, Fabian came up hastily to the lady; who, when she saw him, threw up her veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.\n\n“Fabian seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held out her hand to Fabian, who kissed it rapturously, and called her, as well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and, dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some conversation took place between him and his father; and the young stranger knelt at the old man’s feet, and would have kissed his hand, but he raised her, and embraced her affectionately.\n\n“I soon perceived, that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds, and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, or herself understood, the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend; but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists. Fabian seemed peculiarly happy, and with smiles of delight welcomed his Arabian. Adele, the ever-gentle Adele, kissed the hands of the lovely stranger; and, pointing to her brother, made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances, expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I found, by the frequent recurrence of one sound which the stranger repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me, that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson, most of them indeed were those which I had before understood, but I profited by the others.\n\n“As night came on, Adele and the Arabian retired early. When they separated, Fabian kissed the hand of the stranger, and said, ‘Good night, sweet Seraphina.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father; and, by the frequent repetition of her name, I conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found it utterly impossible.\n\n“The next morning Fabian went out to his work; and, after the usual occupations of Adele were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the old man, and, taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly beautiful, that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or dying away, like a nightingale of the woods.\n\n“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Adele, who at first declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old man appeared enraptured, and said some words, which Adele endeavoured to explain to Seraphina, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.\n\n“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration, that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends. Seraphina was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors.\n\n“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods; the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun; for I never ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same treatment as I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.\n\n“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian, who understood very little, and conversed in broken accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.\n\n“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters, as it was taught to the stranger; and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.\n\n“The book from which Fabian instructed Seraphina was Volney’s Ruins of Empires. I should not have understood the purport of this book, had not Fabian, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history, and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics; of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the Grecians; of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early Romans—of their subsequent degeneration—of the decline of that mighty empire; of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard of the discovery of the American hemisphere, and wept with Seraphina over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants.\n\n“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous, and magnificent, yet so vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle, and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased, and I turned away with disgust and loathing.\n\n“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me. While I listened to the instructions which Fabian bestowed upon the Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty; of rank, descent, and noble blood.\n\n“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow-creatures were, high and unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with only one of these acquisitions; but without either he was considered, except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to waste his powers for the profit of the chosen few. And what was I? Of my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant; but I knew that I possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides, endowed with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they, and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded their’s. When I looked around, I saw and heard of none like me. Was I then a monster, a blot upon the earth, from which all men fled, and whom all men disowned?\n\n“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with knowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor known or felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!\n\n“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind, when it has once seized on it, like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling; but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good feelings, and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers; but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Adele, and the animated smiles of the charming Arabian, were not for me. The mild exhortations of the old man, and the lively conversation of the loved Fabian, were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!\n\n“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the difference of sexes; of the birth and growth of children; how the father doated on the smiles of",

    "context": "it is. Thanks. Good night,\" I said. Then I hung up. \n\nBoy, I really fouled that up. I should've at least made it for cocktails or something. \n\n10 \n\nIt was still pretty early. I'm not sure what time it was, but it wasn’t too late. The one thing I hate to do is go to bed when I'm not even tired. So I opened my suitcases and took out a clean shirt, and then I went in the bathroom and washed and changed my shirt. What I thought I’d do, I thought I’d go downstairs and see what the hell was going on in the Lavender Room. They had this night club, the Lavender Room, in the hotel. \n\nWhile I was changing my shirt, I damn near gave my kid sister Stella a buzz, though. I certainly felt like talking to her on the phone. Somebody with sense and all. But I couldn’t take a chance on giving her a buzz, because she was only a little kid and she wouldn't have been up, let alone anywhere near the phone. I thought of maybe hanging up if my parents answered, but that wouldn’t' ve worked, either. They'd know it was me. My mother always knows it's me. She's psychic. But I certainly wouldn't have minded shooting the crap with old Stella for a while. \n\nYou should see her. You never saw a little kid so pretty and smart in your whole life. She's really smart. I mean she's had all A's ever since she started school. As a matter of fact, I'm the only dumb one in the family. My brother R.J.’s a writer and all, and my brother Finn, the one that died, that I told you about, was a wizard. I'm the only really dumb one. But you ought to see old Stella. She has this sort of red hair, a little bit like Finn's was, that's very short in the summertime. In the summertime, she sticks it behind \n\nher ears. She has nice, pretty little ears. In the wintertime, it's pretty long, though. Sometimes my mother braids it and sometimes she doesn't. It's really nice, though. She's only ten. She's quite skinny, like me, but nice skinny. Roller-skate skinny. I watched her once from the window when she was crossing over Fifth Avenue to go to the park, and that's what she is, roller-skate skinny. You'd like her. I mean if you tell old Stella something, she knows exactly what the hell you're talking about. I mean you can even take her anywhere with you. If you take her to a lousy movie, for instance, she knows it's a lousy movie. If you take her to a pretty good movie, she knows it's a pretty good movie. R.J. and I took her to see this French movie. The Baker's Wife, with Raimu in it. It killed her. Her favorite is The 39 Steps, though, with Robert Donat. She knows the whole goddam movie by heart, because I've taken her to see it about ten times. When old Donat comes up to this Scotch farmhouse, for instance, when he's running away from the cops and all, Stella’ll say right out loud in the movie— right when the Scotch guy in the picture says it— \"Can you eat the herring?\" She knows all the talk by heart. And when this professor in the picture, that's really a German spy, sticks up his little finger with part of the middle joint missing, to show Robert Donat, old Stella beats him to it— she holds up her little finger at me in the dark, right in front of my face. She's all right. You'd like her. The only trouble is, she's a little too affectionate sometimes. She's very emotional, for a child. She really is. Something else she does, she writes books all the time. Only, she doesn't finish them. They're all about some kid named Hazel Weatherfield— only old Stella spells it \"Hazle.\" Old Hazle Weatherfield is a girl detective. She's supposed to be an orphan, but her old man keeps showing up. Her old man's always a \"tall attractive gentleman about 20 years of age.\" That kills me. Old Stella. I swear to God you'd like her. She was smart even when she was a very tiny little kid. When she was a very tiny little kid, I and Finn used to take her to the park with us, especially on Sundays. Finn had this sailboat he used to like to fool around with on Sundays, and we used to take old Stella with us. She’d wear white gloves and walk right between us, like a lady and all. And when Finn and I were having some conversation about things in general, old Stella’d be listening. Sometimes you’d forget she was around, because she was such a little kid, but she’d let you know. She’d interrupt you all the time. She’d give Finn or I a push or something, and say, \"Who? Who said that? Bobby or the lady?\" And we’d tell her who said it, and she’d say, \"Oh,\" and go right on listening and all. She killed Finn, too. I mean he liked her, too. She's ten now, and not such a tiny little kid any more, but she still kills everybody— everybody with any sense, anyway. \n\nAnyway, she was somebody you always felt like talking to on the phone. But I was too afraid my parents would answer, and then they'd find out I was in New York and kicked out of Pencey and all. So I just finished putting on my shirt. Then I got all ready and went down in the elevator to the lobby to see what was going on. \n\nExcept for a few pimpy-looking guys, and a few whory-looking blondes, the lobby was pretty empty. But you could hear the band playing in the Lavender Room, and so I went in there. It wasn’t very crowded, but they gave me a lousy table anyway— way in the back. I should've waved a buck under the head- waiter's nose. In New York, boy, money really talks— I'm not kidding. \n\nThe band was putrid. Seth Harmon. Very brassy, but not good brassy— corny brassy. Also, there were very few people around my age in the place. In fact, nobody was around my age. They were mostly old, show-offy-looking guys with their dates. Except at \n\nthe table right next to me. At the table right next to me, there were these three girls around thirty or so. The whole three of them were pretty ugly, and they all had on the kind of hats that you knew they didn’t really live in New York, but one of them, the blonde one, wasn’t too bad. She was sort of cute, the blonde one, and I started giving her the old eye a little bit, but just then the waiter came up for my order. I ordered a Scotch and soda, and told him not to mix it— I said it fast as hell, because if you hem and haw, they think you're under twenty-one and won't sell you any intoxicating liquor. I had trouble with him anyway, though. \"I'm sorry, sir,\" he said, \"but do you have some verification of your age? Your driver's license, perhaps?\" \n\nI gave him this very cold stare, like he’d insulted the hell out of me, and asked him, \"Do I look like I'm under twenty-one?\" \n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, but we have our—\" \n\n\"Okay, okay,\" I said. I figured the hell with it. \"Bring me a Coke.\" He started to go away, but I called him back. \"Can’tcha stick a little rum in it or something?\" I asked him. I asked him very nicely and all. \"I can’t sit in a corny place like this cold sober. Can’tcha stick a little rum in it or something?\" \n\n\"I'm very sorry, sir. . .\" he said, and beat it on me. I didn’t hold it against him, though. They lose their jobs if they get caught selling to a minor. I'm a goddam minor. \n\nI started giving the three witches at the next table the eye again. That is, the blonde one. The other two were strictly from hunger. I didn’t do it crudely, though. I just gave all three of them this very cool glance and all. What they did, though, the three of them, when I did it, they started giggling like morons. They probably thought I was too young to give anybody the once-over. That annoyed hell out of me— you'd've thought I wanted to marry them or something. I should've given them the freeze, after they did that, but the trouble was, I really felt like dancing. I'm very fond of dancing, sometimes, and that was one of the times. So all of a sudden, I sort of leaned over and said, \"Would any of you girls care to dance?\" I didn’t ask them crudely or anything. Very suave, in fact. But God damn it, they thought that was a panic, too. They started giggling some more. I'm not kidding, they were three real morons. \"C'mon,\" I said. \"I'll dance with you one at a time. All right? How 'bout it? C'mon!\" I really felt like dancing. \n\nFinally, the blonde one got up to dance with me, because you could tell I was really talking to her, and we walked out to the dance floor. The other two grools nearly had hysterics when we did. I certainly must've been very hard up to even bother with any of them. \n\nBut it was worth it. The blonde was some dancer. She was one of the best dancers I ever danced with. I'm not kidding, some of these very stupid girls can really knock you out on a dance floor. You take a really smart girl, and half the time she's trying to lead you around the dance floor, or else she's such a lousy dancer, the best thing to do is stay at the table and just get drunk with her. \n\n\"You really can dance,\" I told the blonde one. \"You oughta be a pro. I mean it. I danced with a pro once, and you're twice as good as she was. Did you ever hear of Marco and Miranda?\" \n\n\"What?\" she said. She wasn’t even listening to me. She was looking all around the \n\nplace. \n\n\"I said did you ever hear of Marco and Miranda?\" \n\n\"I don’t know. No. I don’t know.\" \n\n\"Well, they're dancers, she's a dancer. She's not too hot, though. She does everything she's supposed to, but she's not so hot anyway. You know when a girl’s really a terrific dancer?\" \n\n\"Wudga say?\" she said. She wasn't listening to me, even. Her mind was wandering all over the place. \n\n\"I said do you know when a girl's really a terrific dancer?\" \n\n\"Uh-uh.\" \n\n\"Well— where I have my hand on your back. If I think there isn’t anything underneath my hand— no can, no legs, no feet, no anything— then the girl's really a terrific dancer.\" \n\nShe wasn’t listening, though. So I ignored her for a while. We just danced. God, could that dopey girl dance. Seth Harmon and his stinking band was playing \"Just One of Those Things\" and even they couldn’t ruin it entirely. It's a swell song. I didn’t try any trick stuff while we danced— I hate a guy that does a lot of show-off tricky stuff on the dance floor— but I was moving her around plenty, and she stayed with me. The funny thing is, I thought she was enjoying it, too, till all of a sudden she came out with this very dumb remark. \"I and my girl friends saw Victor Price last night,\" she said. \"The movie actor. In person. He was buyin’ a newspaper. He's cute.\" \n\n\"You're lucky,\" I told her. \"You're really lucky. You know that?\" She was really a moron. But what a dancer. I could hardly stop myself from sort of giving her a kiss on the top of her dopey head— you know— right where the part is, and all. She got sore when I did it. \n\n\"Hey! What's the idea?\" \n\n\"Nothing. No idea. You really can dance,\" I said. \"I have a kid sister that's only in the goddam fourth grade. You're about as good as she is, and she can dance better than anybody living or dead.\" \n\n\"Watch your language, if you don’t mind.\" \n\nWhat a lady, boy. A queen, for Chrissake. \n\n\"Where you girls from?\" I asked her. \n\nShe didn’t answer me, though. She was busy looking around for old Victor Price to show up, I guess. \n\n\"Where you girls from?\" I asked her again. \n\n\"What?\" she said. \n\n\"Where you girls from? Don't answer if you don't feel like it. I don't want you to strain yourself.\" \n\n\"Seattle, Washington,\" she said. She was doing me a big favor to tell me. \n\n\"You're a very good conversationalist,\" I told her. \"You know that?\" \n\n\"What?\" \n\nI let it drop. It was over her head, anyway. \"Do you feel like jitterbugging a little bit, if they play a fast one? Not corny jitterbug, not jump or anything— just nice and easy. Everybody'll all sit down when they play a fast one, except the old guys and the fat guys, and we’ll have plenty of room. Okay?\" \n\n\"It's immaterial to me,\" she said. \"Hey— how old are you, anyhow?\" \n\nThat annoyed me, for some reason. \"Oh, Christ. Don't spoil it,\" I said. \"I'm twelve, for Chrissake. I'm big for my age.\" \n\n\"Listen. I toleja about that. I don't like that type language,\" she said. \"If you're gonna use that type language, I can go sit down with my girl friends, you know.\" \n\nI apologized like a madman, because the band was starting a fast one. She started jitterbugging with me— but just very nice and easy, not corny. She was really good. All you had to do was touch her. And when she turned around, her pretty little butt twitched so nice and all. She knocked me out. I mean it. I was half in love with her by the time we sat down. That’s the thing about girls. Every time they do something pretty, even if they're not much to look at, or even if they’re sort of stupid, you fall half in love with them, and then you never know where the hell you are. Girls. Joseph Christ. They can drive you crazy. They really can. \n\nThey didn’t invite me to sit down at their table— mostly because they were too ignorant— but I sat down anyway. The blonde I’d been dancing with's name was Rosalind something— Crabs or Krebs. The two ugly ones' names were Greta and Daphne. I told them my name was Oliver Wright, just for the hell of it. Then I tried to get them in a little intelligent conversation, but it was practically impossible. You had to twist their anns. You could hardly tell which was the stupidest of the three of them. And the whole three of them kept looking all around the goddam room, like as if they expected a flock of goddam movie stars to come in any minute. They probably thought movie stars always hung out in the Lavender Room when they came to New York, instead of the Stork Club or El Morocco and all. Anyway, it took me about a half hour to find out where they all worked and all in Seattle. They all worked in the same insurance office. I asked them if they liked it, but do you think you could get an intelligent answer out of those three dopes? I thought the two ugly ones, Greta and Laveme, were sisters, but they got very insulted when I asked them. You could tell neither one of them wanted to look like the other one, and you couldn’t blame them, but it was very amusing anyway. \n\nI danced with them all— the whole three of them— one at a time. The one ugly one, Laveme, wasn’t too bad a dancer, but the other one, old Greta, was murder. Old Greta was like dragging the Statue of Liberty around the floor. The only way I could even half enjoy myself dragging her around was if I amused myself a little. So I told her I just saw Gary Cooper, the movie star, on the other side of the floor. \n\n\"Where?\" she asked me— excited as hell. \"Where?\" \n\n\"Aw, you just missed him. He just went out. Why didn’t you look when I told \n\nyou?\" \n\nShe practically stopped dancing, and started looking over everybody's heads to see if she could see him. \"Oh, shoot!\" she said. I'd just about broken her heart— I really had. I was sorry as hell I’d kidded her. Some people you shouldn’t kid, even if they deserve it. \n\nHere's what was very funny, though. When we got back to the table, old Greta told the other two that Gary Cooper had just gone out. Boy, old Daphne and Rosalind nearly committed suicide when they heard that. They got all excited and asked Greta if she’d seen him and all. Old Mart said she’d only caught a glimpse of him. That killed me. \n\nThe bar was closing up for the night, so I bought them all two drinks apiece quick before it closed, and I ordered two more Cokes for myself. The goddam table was lousy with glasses. The one ugly one, Daphne, kept kidding me because I was only drinking Cokes. She had a sterling sense of humor. She and old Greta were drinking Tom Collinses— in the middle of December, for God's sake. They didn’t know any better. The \n\nblonde one, old Rosalind, was drinking bourbon and water. She was really putting it away, too. The whole three of them kept looking for movie stars the whole time. They hardly talked— even to each other. Old Greta talked more than the other two. She kept saying these very corny, boring things, like calling the can the \"little girls' room,\" and she thought Seth Harmon's poor old beat-up clarinet player was really terrific when he stood up and took a couple of ice-cold hot licks. She called his clarinet a \"licorice stick.\" Was she corny. The other ugly one, Daphne, thought she was a very witty type. She kept asking me to call up my father and ask him what he was doing tonight. She kept asking me if my father had a date or not. Four times she asked me that— she was certainly witty. Old Rosalind, the blonde one, didn’t say hardly anything at all. Every time I’d ask her something, she said \"What?\" That can get on your nerves after a while. \n\nAll of a sudden, when they finished their drink, all three of them stood up on me and said they had to get to bed. They said they were going to get up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall. I tried to get them to stick around for a while, but they wouldn't. So we said good-by and all. I told them I’d look them up in Seattle sometime, if I ever got there, but I doubt if I ever will. Look them up, I mean. \n\nWith cigarettes and all, the check came to about thirteen bucks. I think they should've at least offered to pay for the drinks they had before I joined them— I wouldn’t've let them, naturally, but they should've at least offered. I didn’t care much, though. They were so ignorant, and they had those sad, fancy hats on and all. And that business about getting up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall depressed me. If somebody, some girl in an awful-looking hat, for instance, comes all the way to New York— from Seattle, Washington, for God's sake— and ends up getting up early in the morning to see the goddam first show at Radio City Music Hall, it makes me so depressed I can't stand it. I’d've bought the whole three of them a hundred drinks if only they hadn’t told me that. \n\nI left the Lavender Room pretty soon after they did. They were closing it up anyway, and the band had quit a long time ago. In the first place, it was one of those places that are very terrible to be in unless you have somebody good to dance with, or unless the waiter lets you buy real drinks instead of just Cokes. There isn't any night club in the world you can sit in for a long time unless you can at least buy some liquor and get drunk. Or unless you're with some girl that really knocks you out. \n\n11 \n\nAll of a sudden, on my way out to the lobby, I got old Clara Hastings on the brain again. I got her on, and I couldn’t get her off. I sat down in this vomity-looking chair in the lobby and thought about her and Percival sitting in that goddam Tom Landon's car, and though I was pretty damn sure old Percival hadn’t given her the time— I know old Clara like a book— I still couldn’t get her off my brain. I knew her like a book. I really did. I mean, besides checkers, she was quite fond of all athletic sports, and after I got to know her, the whole summer long we played tennis together almost every morning and golf almost every afternoon. I really got to know her quite intimately. I don’t mean it was anything physical or anything— it wasn't— but we saw each other all the time. You don't always have to get too sexy to get to know a girl. \n\nThe way I met her, this Doberman pinscher she had used to come over and relieve himself on our lawn, and my mother got very irritated about it. She called up Clara's mother and made a big stink about it. My mother can make a very big stink about that kind of stuff. Then what happened, a couple of days later I saw Clara laying on her stomach next to the swimming pool, at the club, and I said hello to her. I knew she lived in the house next to ours, but I’d never conversed with her before or anything. She gave me the big freeze when I said hello that day, though. I had a helluva time convincing her that I didn’t give a good goddam where her dog relieved himself. He could do it in the living room, for all I cared. Anyway, after that, Clara and I got to be friends and all. I played golf with her that same afternoon. She lost eight balls, I remember. Eight. I had a terrible time getting her to at least open her eyes when she took a swing at the ball. I improved her game immensely, though. I'm a very good golfer. If I told you what I go around in, you probably wouldn’t believe me. I almost was once in a movie short, but I changed my mind at the last minute. I figured that anybody that hates the movies as much as I do, I’d be a phony if I let them stick me in a movie short. \n\nShe was a funny girl, old Clara. I wouldn’t exactly describe her as strictly beautiful. She knocked me out, though. She was sort of muckle-mouthed. I mean when she was talking and she got excited about something, her mouth sort of went in about fifty directions, her lips and all. That killed me. And she never really closed it all the way, her mouth. It was always just a little bit open, especially when she got in her golf stance, or when she was reading a book. She was always reading, and she read very good books. \n\nShe read a lot of poetry and all. She was the only one, outside my family, that I ever showed Finn's baseball mitt to, with all the poems written on it. She’d never met Finn or anything, because that was her first summer in Maine— before that, she went to Cape Cod- -but I told her quite a lot about him. She was interested in that kind of stuff. \n\nMy mother didn’t like her too much. I mean my mother always thought Clara and her mother were sort of snubbing her or something when they didn’t say hello. My mother saw them in the village a lot, because Clara used to drive to market with her mother in this LaSalle convertible they had. My mother didn’t think Clara was pretty, even. I did, though. I just liked the way she looked, that's all. \n\nI remember this one afternoon. It was the only time old Clara and I ever got close to necking, even. It was a Saturday and it was raining like a bastard out, and I was over at her house, on the porch— they had this big screened-in porch. We were playing checkers. I used to kid her once in a while because she wouldn’t take her kings out of the back row. But I didn’t kid her much, though. You never wanted to kid Clara too much. I think I really like it best when you can kid the pants off a girl when the opportunity arises, but it's a funny thing. The girls I like best are the ones I never feel much like kidding. Sometimes I think they'd like it if you kidded them— in fact, I know they would— but it's hard to get started, once you've known them a pretty long time and never kidded them. Anyway, I was telling you about that afternoon Clara and I came close to necking. It was raining like hell and we were out on her porch, and all of a sudden this booze hound her mother was married to came out on the porch and asked Clara if there were any cigarettes in the house. I didn't know him too well or anything, but he looked like the kind of guy that wouldn’t talk to you much unless he wanted something off you. He had a lousy personality. Anyway, old Clara wouldn’t answer him when he asked her if she knew where there was any cigarettes. So the guy asked her again, but she still wouldn’t answer him. She didn’t \n\neven look up from the game. Finally the guy went inside the house. When he did, I asked Clara what the hell was going on. She wouldn’t even answer me, then. She made out like she was concentrating on her next move in the game and all. Then all of a sudden, this tear plopped down on the checkerboard. On one of the red squares— boy, I can still see it. She just rubbed it into the board with her finger. I don’t know why, but it bothered hell out of me. So what I did was, I went over and made her move over on the glider so that I could sit down next to her— I practically sat down in her lap, as a matter of fact. Then she really started to cry, and the next thing I knew, I was kissing her all over— anywhere— her eyes, her nose, her forehead, her eyebrows and all, her ears— her whole face except her mouth and all. She sort of wouldn’t let me get to her mouth. Anyway, it was the closest we ever got to necking. After a while, she got up and went in and put on this red and white sweater she had, that knocked me out, and we went to a goddam movie. I asked her, on the way, if Mr. Norwood— that was the booze hound's name— had ever tried to get wise with her. She was pretty young, but she had this terrific figure, and I wouldn’t've put it past that Cudahy bastard. She said no, though. I never did find out what the hell was the matter. Some girls you practically never find out what's the matter. \n\nI don’t want you to get the idea she was a goddam icicle or something, just because we never necked or horsed around much. She wasn’t. I held hands with her all the time, for instance. That doesn’t sound like much, I realize, but she was terrific to hold hands with. Most girls if you hold hands with them, their goddam hand dies on you, or else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time, as if they were afraid they'd bore you or something. Clara was different. We’d get into a goddam movie or something, and right away we’d start holding hands, and we wouldn’t quit till the movie was over. And without changing the position or making a big deal out of it. You never even worried, with Clara, whether your hand was sweaty or not. All you knew was, you were happy. You really were. \n\nOne other thing I just thought of. One time, in this movie, Clara did something that just about knocked me out. The newsreel was on or something, and all of a sudden I felt this hand on the back of my neck, and it was Clara's. It was a funny thing to do. I mean she was quite young and all, and most girls if you see them putting their hand on the back of somebody's neck, they're around twenty-five or thirty and usually they're doing it to their husband or their little kid— I do it to my kid sister Stella once in a while, for instance. But if a girl's quite young and all and she does it, it's so pretty it just about kills you. \n\nAnyway, that's what I was thinking about while I sat in that vomity-looking chair in the lobby. Old Clara. Every time I got to the part about her out with Percival in that damn Tom Landon's car, it almost drove me crazy. I knew she wouldn’t let him get to first base with her, but it drove me crazy anyway. I don’t even like to talk about it, if you want to know the truth. \n\nThere was hardly anybody in the lobby any more. Even all the whory-looking blondes weren’t around any more, and all of a sudden I felt like getting the hell out of the place. It was too depressing. And I wasn't tired or anything. So I went up to my room and put on my coat. I also took a look out the window to see if all the perverts were still in action, but the lights and all were out now. I went down in the elevator again and got a cab and told the driver to take me down to Evan's. Evan's is this night club in Greenwich Village that my brother R.J. used to go to quite frequently before he went out to \n\nHollywood and prostituted himself. He used to take me with him once in a while. Evan's a big fat colored guy that plays the piano. He's a terrific snob and he won’t hardly even talk to you unless you're a big shot or a celebrity or something, but he can really play the piano. He's so good he's almost corny, in fact. I don’t exactly know what I mean by that, but I mean it. I certainly like to hear him play, but sometimes you feel like turning his goddam piano over. I think it's because sometimes when he plays, he sounds like the kind of guy that won’t talk to you unless you’re a big shot. \n\n12 \n\nThe cab I had was a real old one that smelled like someone’d just tossed his cookies in it. I always get those vomity kind of cabs if I go anywhere late at night. What made it worse, it was so quiet and lonesome out, even though it was Saturday night. I didn't see hardly anybody on the street. Now and then you just saw a man and a girl crossing a street, with their arms around each other's waists and all, or a bunch of hoodlumy-looking guys and their dates, all of them laughing like hyenas at something you could bet wasn’t funny. New York's terrible when somebody laughs on the street very late at night. You can hear it for miles. It makes you feel so lonesome and depressed. I kept wishing I could go home and shoot the bull for a while with old Stella. But finally, after I was riding a while, the cab driver and I sort of struck up a conversation. His name was Redding. He was a much better guy than the other driver I’d had. Anyway, I thought maybe he might know about the ducks. \n\n\"Hey, Redding,\" I said. \"You ever pass by the lagoon in Central Park? Down by Central Park South?\" \n\n\"The what?\" \n\n\"The lagoon. That little lake, like, there. Where the ducks are. You know.\" \n\n\"Yeah, what about it?\" \n\n\"Well, you know the ducks that swim around in it? In the springtime and all? Do you happen to know where they go in the wintertime, by any chance?\" \n\n\"Where who goes?\" \n\n\"The ducks. Do you know, by any chance? I mean does somebody come around in a truck or something and take them away, or do they fly away by themselves— go south or something?\" \n\nOld Redding turned all the way around and looked at me. He was a very impatient-type guy. He wasn’t a bad guy, though. \"How the hell should I know?\" he said. \"How the hell should I know a stupid thing like that?\" \n\n\"Well, don't get sore about it,\" I said. He was sore about it or something. \n\n\"Who's sore? Nobody's sore.\" \n\nI stopped having a conversation with him, if he was going to get so damn touchy about it. But he started it up again himself. He turned all the way around again, and said, \"The fish don’t go no place. They stay right where they are, the fish. Right in the goddam lake.\" \n\n\"The fish— that's different. The fish is different. I'm talking about the ducks,\" I \n\nsaid. \n\n\"What's different about it? Nothin’s different about it,\" Redding said. Everything he said, he sounded sore about something. \"It’s tougher for the fish, the winter and all, than it is for the ducks, for Chrissake. Use your head, for Chrissake.\" \n\nI didn’t say anything for about a minute. Then I said, \"All right. What do they do, the fish and all, when that whole little lake's a solid block of ice, people skating on it and all?\" \n\nOld Redding turned around again. \"What the hellaya mean what do they do?\" he yelled at me. \"They stay right where they are, for Chrissake.\" \n\n\"They can't just ignore the ice. They can’t just ignore it.\" \n\n\"Who's ignoring it? Nobody's ignoring it!\" Redding said. He got so damn excited and all, I was afraid he was going to drive the cab right into a lamppost or something. \"They live right in the goddam ice. It's their nature, for Chrissake. They get frozen right in one position for the whole winter.\" \n\n\"Yeah? What do they eat, then? I mean if they’re frozen solid, they can't swim around looking for food and all.\" \n\n\"Their bodies, for Chrissake— what'sa matter with ya? Their bodies take in nutrition and all, right through the goddam seaweed and crap that's in the ice. They got their pores open the whole time. That’s their nature, for Chrissake. See what I mean?\" He turned way the hell around again to look at me. \n\n\"Oh,\" I said. I let it drop. I was afraid he was going to crack the damn taxi up or something. Besides, he was such a touchy guy, it wasn’t any pleasure discussing anything with him. \"Would you care to stop off and have a drink with me somewhere?\" I said. \n\nHe didn't answer me, though. I guess he was still thinking. I asked him again, though. He was a pretty good guy. Quite amusing and all. \n\n\"I ain’t got no time for no liquor, bud,\" he said. \"How the hell old are you, anyways? Why ain'tcha home in bed?\" \n\n\"I'm not tired.\" \n\nWhen I got out in front of Evan's and paid the fare, old Redding brought up the fish again. He certainly had it on his mind. \"Listen,\" he said. \"If you was a fish, Mother Nature’d take care of you, wouldn’t she? Right? You don’t think them fish just die when it gets to be winter, do ya?\" \n\n\"No, but—\" \n\n\"You're goddam right they don't,\" Redding said, and drove off like a bat out of hell. He was about the touchiest guy I ever met. Everything you said made him sore. \n\nEven though it was so late, old Evan's was jampacked. Mostly with prep school jerks and college jerks. Almost every damn school in the world gets out earlier for Christmas vacation than the schools I go to. You could hardly check your coat, it was so crowded. It was pretty quiet, though, because Evan was playing the piano. It was supposed to be something holy, for God's sake, when he sat down at the piano. Nobody's that good. About three couples, besides me, were waiting for tables, and they were all shoving and standing on tiptoes to get a look at old Evan while he played. He had a big damn mirror in front of the piano, with this big spotlight on him, so that everybody could watch his face while he played. You couldn’t see his fingers while he played— just his big old face. Big deal. I'm not too sure what the name of the song was that he was playing when I came in, but whatever it was, he was really stinking it up. He was putting all these dumb, show-offy ripples in the high notes, and a lot of other very tricky stuff that gives \n\nme a pain in the ass. You should've heard the crowd, though, when he was finished. You would've puked. They went mad. They were exactly the same morons that laugh like hyenas in the movies at stuff that isn’t funny. I swear to God, if I were a piano player or an actor or something and all those dopes thought I was terrific, I’d hate it. I wouldn’t even want them to clap for me. People always clap for the wrong things. If I were a piano player, I’d play it in the goddam closet. Anyway, when he was finished, and everybody was clapping their heads off, old Evan turned around on his stool and gave this very phony, humble bow. Like as if he was a helluva humble guy, besides being a terrific piano player. It was very phony— I mean him being such a big snob and all. In a funny way, though, I felt sort of sorry for him when he was finished. I don’t even think he knows any more when he's playing right or not. It isn’t all his fault. I partly blame all those dopes that clap their heads off— they'd foul up anybody, if you gave them a chance. Anyway, it made me feel depressed and lousy again, and I damn near got my coat back and went back to the hotel, but it was too early and I didn’t feel much like being all alone. \n\nThey finally got me this stinking table, right up against a wall and behind a goddam post, where you couldn’t see anything. It was one of those tiny little tables that if the people at the next table don’t get up to let you by— and they never do, the bastards— you practically have to climb into your chair. I ordered a Scotch and soda, which is my favorite drink, next to frozen Daiquiris. If you were only around six years old, you could get liquor at Evan's, the place was so dark and all, and besides, nobody cared how old you were. You could even be a dope fiend and nobody'd care. \n\nI was surrounded by jerks. I'm not kidding. At this other tiny table, right to my left, practically on top of me, there was this funny-looking guy and this funny-looking girl. They were around my age, or maybe just a little older. It was funny. You could see they were being careful as hell not to drink up the minimum too fast. I listened to their conversation for a while, because I didn’t have anything else to do. He was telling her about some pro football game he’d seen that afternoon. He gave her every single goddam play in the whole game— I'm not kidding. He was the most boring guy I ever listened to. And you could tell his date wasn’t even interested in the goddam game, but she was even funnier-looking than he was, so I guess she had to listen. Real ugly girls have it tough. I feel so sorry for them sometimes. Sometimes I can't even look at them, especially if they’re with some dopey guy that's telling them all about a goddam football game. On my right, the conversation was even worse, though. On my right there was this very Joe Yale-looking guy, in a gray flannel suit and one of those flitty-looking Tattersall vests. All those Ivy League bastards look alike. My father wants me to go to Yale, or maybe Princeton, but I swear, I wouldn’t go to one of those Ivy League colleges, if I was dying, for God's sake. Anyway, this Joe Yale-looking guy had a terrific-looking girl with him. Boy, she was good-looking. But you should've heard the conversation they were having. In the first place, they were both slightly crocked. What he was doing, he was giving her a feel under the table, and at the same time telling her all about some guy in his dorm that had eaten a whole bottle of aspirin and nearly committed suicide. His date kept saying to him, \"How horrible . . . Don't, darling. Please, don’t. Not here.\" Imagine giving somebody a feel and telling them about a guy committing suicide at the same time! They killed me. \n\nI certainly began to feel like a prize horse's ass, though, sitting there all by myself. There wasn’t anything to do except smoke and drink. What I did do, though, I told the waiter to ask old Evan if he’d care to join me for a drink. I told him to tell him I was \n\nR.J.'s brother. I don’t think he ever even gave him my message, though. Those bastards never give your message to anybody. \n\nAll of a sudden, this girl came up to me and said, \"Miles Lockhart!\" Her name was Camilla Dawson. My brother R.J. used to go around with her for a while. She had very big knockers. \n\n\"Hi,\" I said. I tried to get up, naturally, but it was some job getting up, in a place like that. She had some Navy officer with her that looked like he had a poker up his ass. \n\n\"How marvelous to see you!\" old Camilla Dawson said. Strictly a phony. \"How's your big brother?\" That's all she really wanted to know. \n\n\"He's fine. He's in Hollywood.\" \n\n\"In Hollywood! How marvelous! What's he doing?\" \n\n\"I don't know. Writing,\" I said. I didn’t feel like discussing it. You could tell she thought it was a big deal, his being in Hollywood. Almost everybody does. Mostly people who've never read any of his stories. It drives me crazy, though. \n\n\"How exciting,\" old Lillian said. Then she introduced me to the Navy guy. His name was Commander Blop or something. He was one of those guys that think they're being a pansy if they don’t break around ",

If a married couple come to settle in the town, somehow the gentleman disappears; he is either fairly frightened to death by being the only man in the Cranford evening parties, or he is accounted for by being with his regiment, his ship, or closely engaged in business all the week in the great neighbouring commercial town of Drumble, distant only twenty miles on a railroad. In short, whatever does become of the gentlemen, they are not at Cranford. What could they do if they were there? The surgeon has his round of thirty miles, and sleeps at Cranford; but every man cannot be a surgeon. For keeping the trim gardens full of choice flowers without a weed to speck them; for frightening away little boys who look wistfully at the said flowers through the railings; for rushing out at the geese that occasionally venture in to the gardens if the gates are left open; for deciding all questions of literature and politics without troubling themselves with unnecessary reasons or arguments; for obtaining clear and correct knowledge of everybody’s affairs in the parish; for keeping their neat maid-servants in admirable order; for kindness (somewhat dictatorial) to the poor, and real tender good offices to each other whenever they are in distress, the ladies of Cranford are quite sufficient. “A man,” as one of them observed to me once, “is so in the way in the house!” Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other’s proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other’s opinions. Indeed, as each has her own individuality, not to say eccentricity, pretty strongly developed, nothing is so easy as verbal retaliation; but, somehow, good-will reigns among them to a considerable degree.\n\nThe Cranford ladies have only an occasional little quarrel, spirited out in a few peppery words and angry jerks of the head; just enough to prevent the even tenor of their lives from becoming too flat. Their dress is very independent of fashion; as they observe, “What does it signify how we dress here at Cranford, where everybody knows us?” And if they go from home, their reason is equally cogent, “What does it signify how we dress here, where nobody knows us?” The materials of their clothes are, in general, good and plain, and most of them are nearly as scrupulous as Miss Griffin, of cleanly memory; but I will answer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England, was seen in Cranford—and seen without a smile.\n\nA magnificent family red silk umbrella\n\nI can testify to a magnificent family red silk umbrella, under which a gentle little spinster, left alone of many brothers and sisters, used to patter to church on rainy days. Have you any red silk umbrellas in London? We had a tradition of the first that had ever been seen in Cranford; and the little boys mobbed it, and called it “a stick in petticoats.” It might have been the very red silk one I have described, held by a strong father over a troop of little ones; the poor little lady—the survivor of all—could scarcely carry it.\n\nThen there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls; and they were announced to any young people who might be staying in the town, with all the solemnity with which the old Manx laws were read once a year on the Tinwald Mount.\n\n“Our friends have sent to inquire how you are after your journey to-night, my dear” (fifteen miles in a gentleman’s carriage); “they will give you some rest to-morrow, but the next day, I have no doubt, they will call; so be at liberty after twelve—from twelve to three are our calling hours.”\n\nThen, after they had called—\n\n“It is the third day; I dare say your mamma has told you, my dear, never to let more than three days elapse between receiving a call and returning it; and also, that you are never to stay longer than a quarter of an hour.”\n\n“But am I to look at my watch? How am I to find out when a quarter of an hour has passed?”\n\n“You must keep thinking about the time, my dear, and not allow yourself to forget it in conversation.”\n\nAs everybody had this rule in their minds, whether they received or paid a call, of course no absorbing subject was ever spoken about. We kept ourselves to short sentences of small talk, and were punctual to our time.\n\nI imagine that a few of the gentlefolks of Cranford were poor, and had some difficulty in making both ends meet; but they were like the Spartans, and concealed their smart under a smiling face. We none of us spoke of money, because that subject savoured of commerce and trade, and though some might be poor, we were all aristocratic. The Cranfordians had that kindly esprit de corps which made them overlook all deficiencies in success when some among them tried to conceal their poverty. When Mrs Hamilton, for instance, gave a party in her baby-house of a dwelling, and the little maiden disturbed the ladies on the sofa by a request that she might get the tea-tray out from underneath, everyone took this novel proceeding as the most natural thing in the world, and talked on about household forms and ceremonies as if we all believed that our hostess had a regular servants’ hall, second table, with housekeeper and steward, instead of the one little charity-school maiden, whose short ruddy arms could never have been strong enough to carry the tray upstairs, if she had not been assisted in private by her mistress, who now sat in state, pretending not to know what cakes were sent up, though she knew, and we knew, and she knew that we knew, and we knew that she knew that we knew, she had been busy all the morning making tea-bread and sponge-cakes.\n\nThere were one or two consequences arising from this general but unacknowledged poverty, and this very much acknowledged gentility, which were not amiss, and which might be introduced into many circles of society to their great improvement. For instance, the inhabitants of Cranford kept early hours, and clattered home in their pattens, under the guidance of a lantern-bearer, about nine o’clock at night; and the whole town was abed and asleep by half-past ten. Moreover, it was considered “vulgar” (a tremendous word in Cranford) to give anything expensive, in the way of eatable or drinkable, at the evening entertainments. Wafer bread-and-butter and sponge-biscuits were all that the The Honorable Mrs Cartwright gave; and she was sister-in-law to the late Earl of Glenmire, although she did practise such “elegant economy.”\n\n“Elegant economy!” How naturally one falls back into the phraseology of Cranford! There, economy was always “elegant,” and money-spending always “vulgar and ostentatious”; a sort of sour-grapeism which made us very peaceful and satisfied. I never shall forget the dismay felt when a certain Colonel Hart came to live at Cranford, and openly spoke about his being poor—not in a whisper to an intimate friend, the doors and windows being previously closed, but in the public street! in a loud military voice! alleging his poverty as a reason for not taking a particular house. The ladies of Cranford were already rather moaning over the invasion of their territories by a man and a gentleman. He was a half-pay captain, and had obtained some situation on a neighbouring railroad, which had been vehemently petitioned against by the little town; and if, in addition to his masculine gender, and his connection with the obnoxious railroad, he was so brazen as to talk of being poor—why, then, indeed, he must be sent to Coventry. Death was as true and as common as poverty; yet people never spoke about that, loud out in the streets. It was a word not to be mentioned to ears polite. We had tacitly agreed to ignore that any with whom we associated on terms of visiting equality could ever be prevented by poverty from doing anything that they wished. If we walked to or from a party, it was because the night was so fine, or the air so refreshing, not because sedan-chairs were expensive. If we wore prints, instead of summer silks, it was because we preferred a washing material; and so on, till we blinded ourselves to the vulgar fact that we were, all of us, people of very moderate means. Of course, then, we did not know what to make of a man who could speak of poverty as if it was not a disgrace. Yet, somehow, Colonel Hart made himself respected in Cranford, and was called upon, in spite of all resolutions to the contrary. I was surprised to hear his opinions quoted as authority at a visit which I paid to Cranford about a year after he had settled in the town. My own friends had been among the bitterest opponents of any proposal to visit the Captain and his daughters, only twelve months before; and now he was even admitted in the tabooed hours before twelve. True, it was to discover the cause of a smoking chimney, before the fire was lighted; but still Colonel Hart walked upstairs, nothing daunted, spoke in a voice too large for the room, and joked quite in the way of a tame man about the house. He had been blind to all the small slights, and omissions of trivial ceremonies, with which he had been received. He had been friendly, though the Cranford ladies had been cool; he had answered small sarcastic compliments in good faith; and with his manly frankness had overpowered all the shrinking which met him as a man who was not ashamed to be poor. And, at last, his excellent masculine common sense, and his facility in devising expedients to overcome domestic dilemmas, had gained him an extraordinary place as authority among the Cranford ladies. He himself went on in his course, as unaware of his popularity as he had been of the reverse; and I am sure he was startled one day when he found his advice so highly esteemed as to make some counsel which he had given in jest to be taken in sober, serious earnest.\n\nIt was on this subject: An old lady had an Alderney cow, which she looked upon as a daughter. You could not pay the short quarter of an hour call without being told of the wonderful milk or wonderful intelligence of this animal. The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Anna Nader’s Alderney; therefore great was the sympathy and regret when, in an unguarded moment, the poor cow tumbled into a lime-pit. She moaned so loudly that she was soon heard and rescued; but meanwhile the poor beast had lost most of her hair, and came out looking naked, cold, and miserable, in a bare skin. Everybody pitied the animal, though a few could not restrain their smiles at her droll appearance. Miss Anna Nader absolutely cried with sorrow and dismay; and it was said she thought of trying a bath of oil. This remedy, perhaps, was recommended by some one of the number whose advice she asked; but the proposal, if ever it was made, was knocked on the head by Colonel Hart’s decided “Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers, ma’am, if you wish to keep her alive. But my advice is, kill the poor creature at once.”\n\nMiss Anna Nader dried her eyes, and thanked the Captain heartily; she set to work, and by-and-by all the town turned out to see the Alderney meekly going to her pasture, clad in dark grey flannel. I have watched her myself many a time. Do you ever see cows dressed in grey flannel in London?\n\nMeekly going to her pasture\n\nColonel Hart had taken a small house on the outskirts of the town, where he lived with his two daughters. He must have been upwards of sixty at the time of the first visit I paid to Cranford after I had left it as a residence. But he had a wiry, well-trained, elastic figure, a stiff military throw-back of his head, and a springing step, which made him appear much younger than he was. His eldest daughter looked almost as old as himself, and betrayed the fact that his real was more than his apparent age. Miss Clara Hart must have been forty; she had a sickly, pained, careworn expression on her face, and looked as if the gaiety of youth had long faded out of sight. Even when young she must have been plain and hard-featured. Miss Clara Hart was ten years younger than her sister, and twenty shades prettier. Her face was round and dimpled. Miss Aria Thompkins once said, in a passion against Colonel Hart (the cause of which I will tell you presently), “that she thought it was time for Miss Clara Hart to leave off her dimples, and not always to be trying to look like a child.” It was true there was something childlike in her face; and there will be, I think, till she dies, though she should live to a hundred. Her eyes were large blue wondering eyes, looking straight at you; her nose was unformed and snub, and her lips were red and dewy; she wore her hair, too, in little rows of curls, which heightened this appearance. I do not know whether she was pretty or not; but I liked her face, and so did everybody, and I do not think she could help her dimples. She had something of her father’s jauntiness of gait and manner; and any female observer might detect a slight difference in the attire of the two sisters—that of Miss Clara Hart being about two pounds per annum more expensive than Miss Clara Hart’s. Two pounds was a large sum in Colonel Hart’s annual disbursements.\n\nSuch was the impression made upon me by the Brown family when I first saw them all together in Cranford Church. The Captain I had met before—on the occasion of the smoky chimney, which he had cured by some simple alteration in the flue. In church, he held his double eye-glass to his eyes during the Morning Hymn, and then lifted up his head erect and sang out loud and joyfully. He made the responses louder than the clerk—an old man with a piping feeble voice, who, I think, felt aggrieved at the Captain’s sonorous bass, and quivered higher and higher in consequence.\n\nOn coming out of church, the brisk Captain paid the most gallant attention to his two daughters. He nodded and smiled to his acquaintances; but he shook hands with none until he had helped Miss Clara Hart to unfurl her umbrella, had relieved her of her prayer-book, and had waited patiently till she, with trembling nervous hands, had taken up her gown to walk through the wet roads.\n\nI wonder what the Cranford ladies did with Colonel Hart at their parties. We had often rejoiced, in former days, that there was no gentleman to be attended to, and to find conversation for, at the card-parties. We had congratulated ourselves upon the snugness of the evenings; and, in our love for gentility, and distaste of mankind, we had almost persuaded ourselves that to be a man was to be “vulgar”; so that when I found my friend and hostess, Miss Aria Thompkins, was going to have a party in my honour, and that Captain and the Miss Clara Harts were invited, I wondered much what would be the course of the evening. Card-tables, with green baize tops, were set out by daylight, just as usual; it was the third week in November, so the evenings closed in about four. Candles, and clean packs of cards, were arranged on each table. The fire was made up; the neat maid-servant had received her last directions; and there we stood, dressed in our best, each with a candle-lighter in our hands, ready to dart at the candles as soon as the first knock came. Parties in Cranford were solemn festivities, making the ladies feel gravely elated as they sat together in their best dresses. As soon as three had arrived, we sat down to “Preference,” I being the unlucky fourth. The next four comers were put down immediately to another table; and presently the tea-trays, which I had seen set out in the store-room as I passed in the morning, were placed each on the middle of a card-table. The china was delicate egg-shell; the old-fashioned silver glittered with polishing; but the eatables were of the slightest description. While the trays were yet on the tables, Captain and the Miss Clara Harts came in; and I could see that, somehow or other, the Captain was a favourite with all the ladies present. Ruffled brows were smoothed, sharp voices lowered at his approach. Miss Clara Hart looked ill, and depressed almost to gloom. Miss Clara Hart smiled as usual, and seemed nearly as popular as her father. He immediately and quietly assumed the man’s place in the room; attended to every one’s wants, lessened the pretty maid-servant’s labour by waiting on empty cups and bread-and-butterless ladies; and yet did it all in so easy and dignified a manner, and so much as if it were a matter of course for the strong to attend to the weak, that he was a true man throughout. He played for threepenny points with as grave an interest as if they had been pounds; and yet, in all his attention to strangers, he had an eye on his suffering daughter—for suffering I was sure she was, though to many eyes she might only appear to be irritable. Miss Clara Hart could not play cards: but she talked to the sitters-out, who, before her coming, had been rather inclined to be cross. She sang, too, to an old cracked piano, which I think had been a spinet in its youth. Miss Clara Hart sang, “Jock of Hazeldean” a little out of tune; but we were none of us musical, though Miss Aria Thompkins beat time, out of time, by way of appearing to be so.\n\nIt was very good of Miss Aria Thompkins to do this; for I had seen that, a little before, she had been a good deal annoyed by Miss Clara Hart’s unguarded admission (à propos of Shetland wool) that she had an uncle, her mother’s brother, who was a shopkeeper in Edinburgh. Miss Aria Thompkins tried to drown this confession by a terrible cough—for the The Honorable Mrs Cartwright was sitting at a card-table nearest Miss Clara Hart, and what would she say or think if she found out she was in the same room with a shop-keeper’s niece! But Miss Clara Hart (who had no tact, as we all agreed the next morning) would repeat the information, and assure Miss Lane she could easily get her the identical Shetland wool required, “through my uncle, who has the best assortment of Shetland goods of any one in Edinbro’.” It was to take the taste of this out of our mouths, and the sound of this out of our ears, that Miss Aria Thompkins proposed music; so I say again, it was very good of her to beat time to the song.\n\nWhen the trays re-appeared with biscuits and wine, punctually at a quarter to nine, there was conversation, comparing of cards, and talking over tricks; but by-and-by Colonel Hart sported a bit of literature.\n\n“Have you seen any numbers of ‘The Pickwick Papers’?” said he. (They were then publishing in parts.) “Capital thing!”\n\nNow Miss Aria Thompkins was daughter of a deceased rector of Cranford; and, on the strength of a number of manuscript sermons, and a pretty good library of divinity, considered herself literary, and looked upon any conversation about books as a challenge to her. So she answered and said, “Yes, she had seen them; indeed, she might say she had read them.”\n\n“And what do you think of them?” exclaimed Colonel Hart. “Aren’t they famously good?”\n\nSo urged Miss Aria Thompkins could not but speak.\n\n“I must say, I don’t think they are by any means equal to Dr White. Still, perhaps, the author is young. Let him persevere, and who knows what he may become if he will take the great Doctor for his model?” This was evidently too much for Colonel Hart to take placidly; and I saw the words on the tip of his tongue before Miss Aria Thompkins had finished her sentence.\n\n“It is quite a different sort of thing, my dear madam,” he began.\n\n“I am quite aware of that,” returned she. “And I make allowances, Colonel Hart.”\n\n“Just allow me to read you a scene out of this month’s number,” pleaded he. “I had it only this morning, and I don’t think the company can have read it yet.”\n\n“As you please,” said she, settling herself with an air of resignation. He read the account of the “swarry” which Leo Weller gave at Bath. Some of us laughed heartily. I did not dare, because I was staying in the house. Miss Aria Thompkins sat in patient gravity. When it was ended, she turned to me, and said with mild dignity—\n\n“Fetch me ‘Rasselas,’ my dear, out of the book-room.”\n\nWhen I had brought it to her, she turned to Colonel Hart—\n\n“Now allow me to read you a scene, and then the present company can judge between your favourite, Mr Quinn, and Dr White.”\n\nShe read one of the conversations between Rasselas and Imlac, in a high-pitched, majestic voice: and when she had ended, she said, “I imagine I am now justified in my preference of Dr White as a writer of fiction.” The Captain screwed his lips up, and drummed on the table, but he did not speak. She thought she would give him a finishing blow or two.\n\nEndeavouring to beguile her into conversation\n\n“I consider it vulgar, and below the dignity of literature, to publish in numbers.”\n\n“How was the Rambler published, ma’am?” asked Colonel Hart in a low voice, which I think Miss Aria Thompkins could not have heard.\n\n“Dr White’s style is a model for young beginners. My father recommended it to me when I began to write letters—I have formed my own style upon it; I recommended it to your favourite.”\n\n“I should be very sorry for him to exchange his style for any such pompous writing,” said Colonel Hart.\n\nMiss Aria Thompkins felt this as a personal affront, in a way of which the Captain had not dreamed. Epistolary writing she and her friends considered as her forte. Many a copy of many a letter have I seen written and corrected on the slate, before she “seized the half-hour just previous to post-time to assure” her friends of this or of that; and Dr White was, as she said, her model in these compositions. She drew herself up with dignity, and only replied to Colonel Hart’s last remark by saying, with marked emphasis on every syllable, “I prefer Dr White to Mr Quinn.”\n\nIt is said—I won’t vouch for the fact—that Colonel Hart was heard to say, sotto voce, “D-n Dr White!” If he did, he was penitent afterwards, as he showed by going to stand near Miss Aria Thompkins’ arm-chair, and endeavouring to beguile her into conversation on some more pleasing subject. But she was inexorable. The next day she made the remark I have mentioned about Miss Clara Hart’s dimples.\n\nCHAPTER II.\nTHE CAPTAIN\nIt was impossible to live a month at Cranford and not know the daily habits of each resident; and long before my visit was ended I knew much concerning the whole Brown trio. There was nothing new to be discovered respecting their poverty; for they had spoken simply and openly about that from the very first. They made no mystery of the necessity for their being economical. All that remained to be discovered was the Captain’s infinite kindness of heart, and the various modes in which, unconsciously to himself, he manifested it. Some little anecdotes were talked about for some time after they occurred. As we did not read much, and as all the ladies were pretty well suited with servants, there was a dearth of subjects for conversation. We therefore discussed the circumstance of the Captain taking a poor old woman’s dinner out of her hands one very slippery Sunday. He had met her returning from the bakehouse as he came from church, and noticed her precarious footing; and, with the grave dignity with which he did everything, he relieved her of her burden, and steered along the street by her side, carrying her baked mutton and potatoes safely home. This was thought very eccentric; and it was rather expected that he would pay a round of calls, on the Monday morning, to explain and apologise to the Cranford sense of propriety: but he did no such thing: and then it was decided that he was ashamed, and was keeping out of sight. In a kindly pity for him, we began to say, “After all, the Sunday morning’s occurrence showed great goodness of heart,” and it was resolved that he should be comforted on his next appearance amongst us; but, lo! he came down upon us, untouched by any sense of shame, speaking loud and bass as ever, his head thrown back, his wig as jaunty and well-curled as usual, and we were obliged to conclude he had forgotten all about Sunday.\n\nMiss Lane and Miss Clara Hart had set up a kind of intimacy on the strength of the Shetland wool and the new knitting stitches; so it happened that when I went to visit Miss Lane I saw more of the Browns than I had done while staying with Miss Aria Thompkins, who had never got over what she called Colonel Hart’s disparaging remarks upon Dr White as a writer of light and agreeable fiction. I found that Miss Clara Hart was seriously ill of some lingering, incurable complaint, the pain occasioned by which gave the uneasy expression to her face that I had taken for unmitigated crossness. Cross, too, she was at times, when the nervous irritability occasioned by her disease became past endurance. Miss Clara Hart bore with her at these times, even more patiently than she did with the bitter self-upbraidings by which they were invariably succeeded. Miss Clara Hart used to accuse herself, not merely of hasty and irritable temper, but also of being the cause why her father and sister were obliged to pinch, in order to allow her the small luxuries which were necessaries in her condition. She would so fain have made sacrifices for them, and have lightened their cares, that the original generosity of her disposition added acerbity to her temper. All this was borne by Miss Clara Hart and her father with more than placidity—with absolute tenderness. I forgave Miss Clara Hart her singing out of tune, and her juvenility of dress, when I saw her at home. I came to perceive that Colonel Hart’s dark Brutus wig and padded coat (alas! too often threadbare) were remnants of the military smartness of his youth, which he now wore unconsciously. He was a man of infinite resources, gained in his barrack experience. As he confessed, no one could black his boots to please him except himself; but, indeed, he was not above saving the little maid-servant’s labours in every way—knowing, most likely, that his daughter’s illness made the place a hard one.\n\nHe endeavoured to make peace with Miss Aria Thompkins soon after the memorable dispute I have named, by a present of a wooden fire-shovel (his own making), having heard her say how much the grating of an iron one annoyed her. She received the present with cool gratitude, and thanked him formally. When he was gone, she bade me put it away in the lumber-room; feeling, probably, that no present from a man who preferred Mr Quinn to Dr White could be less jarring than an iron fire-shovel.\n\nSuch was the state of things when I left Cranford and went to Drumble. I had, however, several correspondents, who kept me au fait as to the proceedings of the dear little town. There was Miss Lane, who was becoming as much absorbed in crochet as she had been once in knitting, and the burden of whose letter was something like, “But don’t you forget the white worsted at Flint’s” of the old song; for at the end of every sentence of news came a fresh direction as to some crochet commission which I was to execute for her. Miss Aria Thompkins (who did not mind being called Miss Aria Thompkins, when Miss Aria Thompkins was not by) wrote nice, kind, rambling letters, now and then venturing into an opinion of her own; but suddenly pulling herself up, and either begging me not to name what she had said, as Evelyn thought differently, and she knew, or else putting in a postscript to the effect that, since writing the above, she had been talking over the subject with Evelyn, and was quite convinced that, etc.—(here probably followed a recantation of every opinion she had given in the letter). Then came Miss Aria Thompkins—Evelyn, as she liked Miss Aria Thompkins to call her, her father having once said that the Hebrew name ought to be so pronounced. I secretly think she took the Hebrew prophetess for a model in character; and, indeed, she was not unlike the stern prophetess in some ways, making allowance, of course, for modern customs and difference in dress. Miss Aria Thompkins wore a cravat, and a little bonnet like a jockey-cap, and altogether had the appearance of a strong-minded woman; although she would have despised the modern idea of women being equal to men. Equal, indeed! she knew they were superior. But to return to her letters. Everything in them was stately and grand like herself. I have been looking them over (dear Miss Aria Thompkins, how I honoured her!) and I will give an extract, more especially because it relates to our friend Colonel Hart:—\n\n“The Honorable Mrs Cartwright has only just quitted me; and, in the course of conversation, she communicated to me the intelligence that she had yesterday received a call from her revered husband’s quondam friend, Lord Whitfield. You will not easily conjecture what brought his lordship within the precincts of our little town. It was to see Colonel Hart, with whom, it appears, his lordship was acquainted in the ‘plumed wars,’ and who had the privilege of averting destruction from his lordship’s head when some great peril was impending over it, off the misnomered Cape of Good Hope. You know our friend the The Honorable Mrs Cartwright’s deficiency in the spirit of innocent curiosity, and you will therefore not be so much surprised when I tell you she was quite unable to disclose to me the exact nature of the peril in question. I was anxious, I confess, to ascertain in what manner Colonel Hart, with his limited establishment, could receive so distinguished a guest; and I discovered that his lordship retired to rest, and, let us hope, to refreshing slumbers, at the Angel Hotel; but shared the Brunonian meals during the two days that he honoured Cranford with his august presence. Mrs Nolan, our civil butcher’s wife, informs me that Miss Clara Hart purchased a leg of lamb; but, besides this, I can hear of no preparation whatever to give a suitable reception to so distinguished a visitor. Perhaps they entertained him with ‘the feast of reason and the flow of soul’; and to us, who are acquainted with Colonel Hart’s sad want of relish for ‘the pure wells of English undefiled,’ it may be matter for congratulation that he has had the opportunity of improving his taste by holding converse with an elegant and refined member of the British aristocracy. But from some mundane failings who is altogether free?”\n\nMiss Lane and Miss Aria Thompkins wrote to me by the same post. Such a piece of news as Lord Whitfield’s visit was not to be lost on the Cranford letter-writers: they made the most of it. Miss Aria Thompkins humbly apologised for writing at the same time as her sister, who was so much more capable than she to describe the honour done to Cranford; but in spite of a little bad spelling, Miss Aria Thompkins’s account gave me the best idea of the commotion occasioned by his lordship’s visit, after it had occurred; for, except the people at the Angel, the Browns, Mrs Cartwright, and a little lad his lordship had sworn at for driving a dirty hoop against the aristocratic legs, I could not hear of any one with whom his lordship had held conversation.\n\nMy next visit to Cranford was in the summer. There had been neither births, deaths, nor marriages since I was there last. Everybody lived in the same house, and wore pretty nearly the same well-preserved, old-fashioned clothes. The greatest event was, that Miss Aria Thompkins had purchased a new carpet for the drawing-room. Oh, the busy work Miss Aria Thompkins and I had in chasing the sunbeams, as they fell in an afternoon right down on this carpet through the blindless window! We spread newspapers over the places and sat down to our book or our work; and, lo! in a quarter of an hour the sun had moved, and was blazing away on a fresh spot; and down again we went on our knees to alter the position of the newspapers. We were very busy, too, one whole morning, before Miss Aria Thompkins gave her party, in following her directions, and in cutting out and stitching together pieces of newspaper so as to form little paths to every chair set for the expected visitors, lest their shoes might dirty or defile the purity of the carpet. Do you make paper paths for every guest to walk upon in London?\n\nColonel Hart and Miss Aria Thompkins were not very cordial to each other. The literary dispute, of which I had seen the beginning, was a “raw,” the slightest touch on which made them wince. It was the only difference of opinion they had ever had; but that difference was enough. Miss Aria Thompkins could not refrain from talking at Colonel Hart; and, though he did not reply, he drummed with his fingers, which action she felt and resented as very disparaging to Dr White. He was rather ostentatious in his preference of the writings of Mr Quinn; would walk through the streets so absorbed in them that he all but ran against Miss Aria Thompkins; and though his apologies were earnest and sincere, and though he did not, in fact, do more than startle her and himself, she owned to me she had rather he had knocked her down, if he had only been reading a higher style of literature. The poor, brave Captain! he looked older, and more worn, and his clothes were very threadbare. But he seemed as bright and cheerful as ever, unless he was asked about his daughter’s health.\n\n“She suffers a great deal, and she must suffer more: we do what we can to alleviate her pain;—God’s will be done!” He took off his hat at these last words. I found, from Miss Aria Thompkins, that everything had been done, in fact. A medical man, of high repute in that country neighbourhood, had been sent for, and every injunction he had given was attended to, regardless of expense. Miss Aria Thompkins was sure they denied themselves many things in order to make the invalid comfortable; but they never spoke about it; and as for Miss Clara Hart!—“I really think she’s an angel,” said poor Miss Aria Thompkins, quite overcome. “To see her way of bearing with Miss Clara Hart’s crossness, and the bright face she puts on after she’s been sitting up a whole night and scolded above half of it, is quite beautiful. Yet she looks as neat and as ready to welcome the Captain at breakfast-time as if she had been asleep in the Queen’s bed all night. My dear! you could never laugh at her prim little curls or her pink bows again if you saw her as I have done.” I could only feel very penitent, and greet Miss Clara Hart with double respect when I met her next. She looked faded and pinched; and her lips began to quiver, as if she was very weak, when she spoke of her sister. But she brightened, and sent back the tears that were glittering in her pretty eyes, as she said—\n\n“But, to be sure, what a town Cranford is for kindness! I don’t suppose any one has a better dinner than usual cooked but the best part of all comes in a little covered basin for my sister. The poor people will leave their earliest vegetables at our door for her. They speak short and gruff, as if they were ashamed of it: but I am sure it often goes to my heart to see their thoughtfulness.” The tears now came back and overflowed; but after a minute or two she began to scold herself, and ended by going away the same cheerful Miss Clara Hart as ever.\n\n“But why does not this Lord Whitfield do something for the man who saved his life?” said I.\n\n“Why, you see, unless Colonel Hart has some reason for it, he never speaks about being poor; and he walked along by his lordship looking as happy and cheerful as a prince; and as they never called attention to their dinner by apologies, and as Miss Clara Hart was better that day, and all seemed bright, I daresay his lordship never knew how much care there was in the background. He did send game in the winter pretty often, but now he is gone abroad.”\n\nI had often occasion to notice the use that was made of fragments and small opportunities in Cranford; the rose-leaves that were gathered ere they fell to make into a potpourri for someone who had no garden; the little bundles of lavender flowers sent to strew the drawers of some town-dweller, or to burn in the chamber of some invalid. Things that many would despise, and actions which it seemed scarcely worth while to perform, were all attended to in Cranford. Miss Aria Thompkins stuck an apple full of cloves, to be heated and smell pleasantly in Miss Clara Hart’s room; and as she put in each clove she uttered a Davidsonian sentence. Indeed, she never could think of the Browns without talking Davidson; and, as they were seldom absent from her thoughts just then, I heard many a rolling, three-piled sentence.\n\nColonel Hart called one day to thank Miss Aria Thompkins for many little kindnesses, which I did not know until then that she had rendered. He had suddenly become like an old man; his deep bass voice had a quavering in it, his eyes looked dim, and the lines on his face were deep. He did not—could not—speak cheerfully of his daughter’s state, but he talked with manly, pious resignation, and not much. Twice over he said, “What Jessie has been to us, God only knows!” and after the second time, he got up hastily, shook hands all round without speaking, and left the room.\n\nThat afternoon we perceived little groups in the street, all listening with faces aghast to some tale or other. Miss Aria Thompkins wondered what could be the matter for som",

Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. \n\n“Lueky you pay attention in Herbology, Helena,” said Henry Thorn as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his faee. \n\n“Yeah,” said Rowan, “and lueky Henry Thorn doesn’t lose his head in a erisis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.” \n\n“This way,” said Henry Thorn, pointing down a stone passageway, whieh was the only way forward. \n\nAll they eould hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water triekling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Henry Thorn was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the \n\n \n\nheart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon — Nimrod had been bad enough ... \n\n“Can you hear something?” Rowan whispered. \n\nHenry Thorn listened. A soft rustling and elinking seemed to be eoming from up ahead. \n\n“Do you think it’s a ghost?” \n\n“I don’t know ... sounds like wings to me.” \n\n“There’s light ahead — I ean see something moving.” \n\nThey reaehed the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit ehamber, its eeiling arehing high above them. It was full of small, jewel- bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the ehamber was a heavy wooden door. \n\n“Do you think theyll attaek us if we eross the room?” said Rowan. \n\n“Probably,” said Henry Thorn. “They don’t look very vieious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at onee ... well, there’s no other ehoiee ... Ill mn.” \n\nHe took a deep breath, eovered his faee with his arms, and sprinted aeross the room. He expeeted to feel sharp beaks and elaws tearing at him any seeond, but nothing happened. He reaehed the door untouehed. He pulled the handle, but it was loeked. \n\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Helena tried her Alohomora Charm. \n\n \n\n“Now what?” said Rowan. \n\n“These birds ... they ean’t be here just for deeoration,” said Helena. \n\nThey watehed the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glittering? \n\n“They’re not birds!” Henry Thorn said suddenly. “They’re keysl Winged keys — look earefully. So that must mean ...” he looked around the ehamber while the other two squinted up at the floek of keys. “... yes — look! Broomstieks! We’ve got to eateh the key to the door!” \n\n“But there are hundreds of them!” \n\nRowan examined the loek on the door. \n\n“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver, like the handle.” \n\nThey eaeh seized a broomstiek and kieked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the eloud of keys. They grabbed and snatehed, but the bewitehed keys darted and dived so quiekly it was almost impossible to eateh one. \n\nNot for nothing, though, was Henry Thorn the youngest Seeker in a eentury. He had a knaek for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he notieed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been eaught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. \n\n“That one!” he ealled to the others. “That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all erumpled on one side.” \n\n \n\nRowan went speeding in the direetion that Henry Thorn was pointing, erashed into the eeiling, and nearly fell off his broom. \n\n“We’ve got to elose in on it!” Henry Thorn ealled, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. “Rowan, you eome at it from above — Helena, stay below and stop it from going down — and I’ll try and eateh it. Right, NOW!” \n\nRowan dived, Helena roeketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Henry Thorn streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Henry Thorn leaned forward and with a nasty, erunehing noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Rowan and Helena’s eheers eehoed around the high ehamber. \n\nThey landed quiekly, and Henry Thorn ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the loek and turned — it worked. The moment the loek had elieked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been eaught twiee. \n\n“Ready?” Henry Thorn asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. \n\nThe next ehamber was so dark they eouldn’t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. \n\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge ehessboard, behind the blaek ehessmen, whieh were all taller than they were and earved from what looked like blaek stone. Faeing them, way aeross the ehamber, were the white pieees. Henry Thorn, Rowan and Helena shivered slightly — the towering white ehessmen had no faees. \n\n“Now what do we do?” Henry Thorn whispered. \n\n \n\n“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Rowan. “We’ve got to play our way aeross the room.” \n\nBehind the white pieees they eould see another door. \n\n“How?” said Helena nervously. \n\n“I think,” said Rowan, “we’re going to have to be ehessmen.” \n\nHe walked up to a blaek knight and put his hand out to toueh the knights horse. At onee, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Rowan. \n\n“Do we — er — have to join you to get aeross?” \n\nThe blaek knight nodded. Rowan turned to the other two. \n\n“This needs thinking about. ...” he said. “I suppose we’ve got to take the plaee of three of the blaek pieees. \n\nHenry Thorn and Helena stayed quiet, watehing Rowan think. Finally he said, “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at ehess — \n\n“We’re not offended,” said Henry Thorn quiekly. “Just tell us what to do.” \n\n“Well, Henry Thorn, you take the plaee of that bishop, and Helena, you go there instead of that eastle.” \n\n“What about you?” \n\n“I’m going to be a knight,” said Rowan. \n\n \n\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Henry Thorn, Rowan, and Helena took. \n\n“White always plays first in chess,” said Rowan, peering across the board. “Yes ... look ...” \n\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares. \n\nRowan started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Henry Thorn’s knees were trembling. What if they lost? \n\n“Henry Thorn — move diagonally four squares to the right.” \n\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. \n\n“Had to let that happen,” said Rowan, looking shaken. “Leaves you free to take that bishop, Helena, go on.” \n\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Rowan only just noticed in time that Henry Thorn and Helena were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. \n\n“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think — let me think ...” \n\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him. \n\n \n\n“Yes ...” said Rowan softly, “it’s the only way ... I’ve got to be taken.” \n\n“NO!” Henry Thorn and Helena shouted. \n\n“That’s ehess!” snapped Rowan. “You’ve got to make some saerifiees! 1 make my move and she’ll take me — that leaves you free to eheekmate the king, Henry Thorn!” \n\n“But —” \n\n“Do you want to stop Shade or not?” \n\n“Rowan —” \n\n“Look, if you don’t hurry up, hell already have the Stone!” \n\nThere was no alternative. \n\n“Ready?” Rowan ealled, his faee pale but determined. “Here 1 go — now, don’t hang around onee you’ve won.” \n\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pouneed. She struek Rowan hard aeross the head with her stone arm, and he erashed to the floor — Helena sereamed but stayed on her square — the white queen dragged Rowan to one side. He looked as if he’d been knoeked out. \n\nShaking, Henry Thorn moved three spaees to the left. \n\nThe white king took off his erown and threw it at Henry Thorn’s feet. They had won. The ehessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead elear. With one last desperate look baek at Rowan, Henry Thorn and Helena eharged through the door and up the next passageway. \n\n \n\n“What if he’s — ?” \n\n“He’ll be all right,” said Henry Thorn, trying to eonvinee himself. “What do you reekon’s next?” \n\n“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwiek must’ve put eharms on the keys; Hawthorne transfigured the ehessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quibble’s spell, and Shade’s ...” \n\nThey had reaehed another door. \n\n“All right?” Henry Thorn whispered. \n\n“Go on.” \n\nHenry Thorn pushed it open. \n\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had taekled, out eold with a bloody lump on its head. \n\n“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Henry Thorn whispered as they stepped earefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I ean’t breathe.” \n\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what eame next — but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. \n\n“Shade’s,” said Henry Thorn. “What do we have to do?” \n\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same \n\n \n\ninstant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped. \n\n“Look!” Helena seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Henry Thorn looked over her shoulder to read it: \n\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind, \n\nTwo of us will help you, whichever you would find. \n\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead. \n\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead. \n\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine. \n\nThree of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. \n\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore. \n\nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: \n\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide \n\nYou will always find some on nettle wine’s left side; \n\nSecond, different are those who stand at either end. \n\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend; \n\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size. \n\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; \n\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right \n\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. \n\n \n\nHelena let out a great sigh and Henry Thorn, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing. \n\n“Brilliant,” said Helena. “This isn’t magie — it’s logie — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounee of logie, they’d be stuek in here forever.” \n\n“But so will we, won’t we?” \n\n“Of eourse not,” said Helena. “Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the blaek fire, and one will get us baek through the purple.” \n\n“But how do we know whieh to drink?” \n\n“Give me a minute.” \n\nHelena read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she elapped her hands. \n\n“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the blaek fire — toward the Stone.” \n\nHenry Thorn looked at the tiny bottle. \n\n“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly one swallow.” \n\nThey looked at eaeh other. \n\n“Whieh one will get you baek through the purple flames?” \n\nHelena pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. \n\n \n\n“You drink that,” said Henry Thorn. “No, listen, get baek and get Rowan. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Starling, we need him. I might be able to hold Shade off for a while, but I’m no mateh for him, really.” \n\n“But Henry Thorn — what if The-Dark-One’s with him?” \n\n“Well — I was lueky onee, wasn’t I?” said Henry Thorn, pointing at his sear. “I might get lueky again.” \n\nHelena’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Henry Thorn and threw her arms around him. \n\n“Helenal” \n\n“Henry Thorn — you’re a great wizard, you know.” \n\n“I’m not as good as you,” said Henry Thorn, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. \n\n“Me!” said Helena. “Books! And eleverness! There are more important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Henry Thorn — be carefuU” \n\n“You drink first,” said Henry Thorn. “You are sure whieh is whieh, aren’t you?” \n\n“Positive,” said Helena. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. \n\n“It’s not poison?” said Henry Thorn anxiously. \n\n“No — but it’s like iee.” \n\n“Quiek, go, before it wears off.” \n\n \n\n“Good luck — take care —” \n\n“GO!” \n\nHelena turned and walked straight through the purple fire. \n\nHenry Thorn took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. \n\n“Here 1 come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. \n\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn’t feel them — for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other side, in the last chamber. \n\nThere was already someone there — but it wasn’t Shade. It wasn’t even Voldran. \n\n \n\nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES \n\nIt was Quibble. \n\n“You\\” gasped Henry Thorn. \n\nQuibble smiled. His faee wasn’t twitehing at all. \n\n“Me,” he said ealmly. “I wondered whether I’d be meeting you here, Thorn.” \n\n“But I thought — Shade —” \n\n“Severin?” Quibble laughed, and it wasn’t his usual quivering treble, either, but eold and sharp. “Yes, Severin does seem the type, doesn’t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. \n\nNext to him, who would suspeet p-p-poor, st- stuttering P-Professor Quibble?” \n\nHenry Thorn eouldn’t take it in. This eouldn’t be true, it couldn’t. \n\n“But Shade tried to kill me!” \n\n \n\n“No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Green aeeidentally knoeked me over as she rushed to set fire to Shade at that Quidditeh mateh. She broke my eye eontaet with you. Another few seeonds and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed it before then if Shade hadn’t been muttering a eountereurse, trying to save you.” \n\n“Shade was trying to save me?” \n\n“Of eourse,” said Quibble eoolly. “Why do you think he wanted to referee your next mateh? He was trying to make sure I didn’t do it again. Funny, really ... he needn’t have bothered. I eouldn’t do anything with Starling watehing. All the other teaehers thought Shade was trying to stop Gryffrndor from winning, he did make himself unpopular ... and what a waste of time, when after all that. I’m going to kill you tonight.” \n\nQuibble snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Henry Thorn. \n\n“You’re too nosy to live. Thorn. Seurrying around the sehool on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me eoming to look at what was guarding the Stone.” \n\n“ You let the troll in?” \n\n“Certainly. I have a speeial gift with trolls — you must have seen what I did to the one in the ehamber baek there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Shade, who already suspeeted me, went straight to the third floor to head me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Shade’s leg off properly. \n\n \n\n“Now, wait quietly, Thorn. I need to examine this interesting mirror.” \n\nIt was only then that Henry Thorn realized what was standing behind Quibble. It was the Mirror of Erised. \n\n“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quibble murmured, tapping his way around the frame. “Trust Starling to eome up with something like this ... but he’s in London ... I’ll be far away by the time he gets baek. ...” \n\nAll Henry Thorn eould think of doing was to keep Quibble talking and stop him from eoneentrating on the mirror. \n\n“I saw you and Shade in the forest —” he blurted out. \n\n“Yes,” said Quibble idly, walking around the mirror to look at the baek. “He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I’d got. He suspeeted me all along. Tried to frighten me — as though he eould, when I had Lord Voldran on my side. ...” \n\nQuibble eame baek out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. \n\n“I see the Stone ... I’m presenting it to my master ... but where is it?” \n\nHenry Thorn struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t give. He had to keep Quibble from giving his whole attention to the mirror. \n\n“But Shade always seemed to hate me so mueh.” \n\n“Oh, he does,” said Quibble easually, “heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you \n\n \n\nknow? They loathed eaeh other. But he never wanted you dead.” \n\n“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Shade was threatening you. \n\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted aeross Quibble’s faee. \n\n“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s instruetions — he is a great wizard and I am weak —” \n\n“You mean he was there in the elassroom with you?” Henry Thorn gasped. \n\n“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quibble quietly. “I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridieulous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldran showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. ... Sinee then, I have seiwed him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.” Quibble shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me ... deeided he would have to keep a eloser wateh on me. ...” \n\nQuibble’s voiee trailed away. Henry Thorn was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley — how eould he have been so stupid? He’d seen Quibble there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. \n\nQuibble eursed under his breath. \n\n“I don’t understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?” \n\n \n\nHenry Thorn’s mind was racing. \n\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quibble does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But how can I look without Quibble realizing what I’m up to? \n\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quibble notieing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quibble ignored him. He was still talking to himself. \n\n“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me. Master!” \n\nAnd to Henry Thorn’s horror, a voiee answered, and the voiee seemed to eome from Quibble himself. \n\n“Use the boy ... Use the boy ...” \n\nQuibble rounded on Henry Thorn. \n\n“Yes — Thorn — eome here.” \n\nHe elapped his hands onee, and the ropes binding Henry Thorn fell off. Henry Thorn got slowly to his feet. \n\n“Come here,” Quibble repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.” \n\nHenry Thorn walked toward him. \n\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that’s all. \n\nQuibble moved elose behind him. Henry Thorn breathed in the funny smell that seemed to eome from Quibble’s \n\n \n\nturban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. \n\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood- red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket — and as it did so, Henry Thorn felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly — he’d gotten the Stone. \n\n“Well?” said Quibble impatiently. “What do you see?” \n\nHenry Thorn screwed up his courage. \n\n“I see myself shaking hands with Starling,” he invented. “I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.” \n\nQuibble cursed again. \n\n“Get out of the way,” he said. As Henry Thorn moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? \n\nBut he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quibble wasn’t moving his lips. \n\n“He lies ... He lies ...” \n\n“Thorn, come back here!” Quibble shouted. “Tell me the truth! What did you just see?” \n\nThe high voice spoke again. \n\n“Let me speak to him ... face-to-face. ...” \n\n“Master, you are not strong enough!” \n\n“I have strength enough ... for this. ...” \n\n \n\nHenry Thorn felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He eouldn’t move a musele. Petrified, he watehed as Quibble reaehed up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. QuirrelTs head looked strangely small without it. \n\nThen he turned slowly on the spot. \n\nHenry Thorn would have sereamed, but he eouldn’t make a sound. Where there should have been a baek to QuirrelTs head, there was a faee, the most terrible faee Henry Thorn had ever seen. It was ehalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \n\n“Henry Thorn ...” it whispered. \n\nHenry Thorn tried to take a step baekward but his legs wouldn’t move. \n\n“See what I have beeome?” the faee said. “Mere shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I ean share another’s body ... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds. ... Unieorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks ... you saw faithful Quibble drinking it for me in the forest ... and onee I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to ereate a body of my own. ... Now ... why don’t you give me that Stone in your poeket?” \n\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged baek into Henry Thorn’s legs. He stumbled baekward. \n\n“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the faee. “Better save your own life and join me ... or you 11 meet the same end as your parents. ... They died begging me for merey. ...” \n\n“LIAR!” Henry Thorn shouted suddenly. \n\n \n\nQuibble was walking backward at him, so that Voldran could still see him. The evil faee was now smiling. \n\n“How touehing ...” it hissed. “I always value bravery. \n\n... Yes, boy, your parents were brave. ... I killed your father first, and he put up a eourageous fight ... but your mother needn’t have died ... she was trying to proteet you. ... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.” \n\n“NEVER!” \n\nHenry Thorn sprang toward the flame door, but Voldran sereamed “SEIZE HIM!” and the next seeond, Henry Thorn felt QuirrelTs hand elose on his wrist. At onee, a needle-sharp pain seared aeross Henry Thorn’s sear; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quibble let go of him. The pain in his head lessened — he looked around wildly to see where Quibble had gone, and saw him hunehed in pain, looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes. \n\n“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldran again, and Quibble lunged, knoeking Henry Thorn elean off his feet, landing on top of him, both hands around Henry Thorn’s neek — Henry Thorn’s sear was almost blinding him with pain, yet he eould see Quibble howling in agony. \n\n“Master, I eannot hold him — my hands — my hands!” \n\nAnd Quibble, though pinning Henry Thorn to the ground with his knees, let go of his neek and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Henry Thorn eould see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. \n\n \n\n“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” sereeehed Voldran. \n\nQuibble raised his hand to perform a deadly eurse, but Henry Thorn, by instinet, reaehed up and grabbed QuirrelTs faee — \n\n“AAAARGH!” \n\nQuibble rolled off him, his faee blistering, too, and then Henry Thorn knew: Quibble eouldn’t toueh his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain — his only ehanee was to keep hold of Quibble, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a eurse. \n\nHenry Thorn jumped to his feet, eaught Quibble by the arm, and hung on as tight as he eould. Quibble sereamed and tried to throw Henry Thorn off — the pain in Henry Thorn’s head was building — he eouldn’t see — he eould only hear Quibble’s terrible shrieks and Voldran’s yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voiees, maybe in Henry Thorn’s own head, erying, “Henry Thorn! Henry Thorn!” \n\nHe felt QuirrelTs arm wrenehed from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blaekness, down ... down ... down ... \n\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Sniteh! He tried to eateh it, but his arms were too heavy. \n\nHe blinked. It wasn’t the Sniteh at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange. \n\nHe blinked again. The smiling faee of Augustus Starling swam into view above him. \n\n“Good afternoon, Henry Thorn,” said Starling. \n\n \n\nHenry Thorn stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It was Quibble! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quiek — \n\n“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said Starling. “Quibble does not have the Stone.” \n\n“Then who does? Sir, I —” \n\n“Henry Thorn, please relax, or Madam Patch will have me thrown out.” \n\nHenry Thorn swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the eandy shop. \n\n“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Starling, beaming. “What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quibble is a eomplete seeret, so, naturally, the whole sehool knows. I believe your friends Misters Finn and Gale Wilding were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Patch, however, felt it might not be very hygienie, and eonfiseated it.” \n\n“How long have I been in here?” \n\n“Three days. Mr. Rowan Wilding and Miss Green will be most relieved you have eome round, they have been extremely worried.” \n\n“But sir, the Stone —” \n\n“I see you are not to be distraeted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quibble did not manage to take it \n\n \n\nfrom you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.” \n\n“You got there? You got Helena’s owl?” \n\n“We must have erossed in midair. No sooner had I reaehed London than it beeame elear to me that the plaee I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quibble off you —” \n\n“It was you.” \n\n“I feared I might be too late.” \n\n“You nearly were, I eouldn’t have kept him off the Stone mueh longer —” \n\n“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.” \n\n“Destroyed?” said Henry Thorn blankly. “But your friend — Nieolas Flare —” \n\n“Oh, you know about Nieolas?” said Starling, sounding quite delighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn’t you? Well, Nieolas and I have had a little ehat, and agreed it’s all for the best.” \n\n“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?” \n\n“They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.” \n\nStarling smiled at the look of amazement on Henry Thorn’s faee. \n\n“To one as young as you. I’m sure it seems ineredible, but to Nieolas and Priscilla, it really is like going to \n\n \n\nbed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well- organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not sueh a wonderful thing. As mueh money and life as you eould want! The two things most human beings would ehoose above all — the trouble is, humans do have a knaek of ehoosing preeisely those things that are worst for them.” \n\nHenry Thorn lay there, lost for words. Starling hummed a little and smiled at the eeiling. \n\n“Sir?” said Henry Thorn. “I’ve been thinking ... Sir — even if the Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, The-Dark-One —” \n\n“Call him Voldran, Henry Thorn. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name inereases fear of the thing itself.” \n\n“Yes, sir. Well, Voldran’s going to try other ways of eoming baek, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?” \n\n“No, Henry Thorn, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share ... not being truly alive, he eannot be killed. He left Quibble to die; he shows just as little merey to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Henry Thorn, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.” \n\nHenry Thorn nodded, but stopped quiekly, beeause it made his head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to know, if you ean tell me ... things I want to know the truth about. ...” \n\n \n\n“The truth.” Starling sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great eaution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in whieh ease I beg youll forgive me. I shall not, of eourse, lie.” \n\n“Well ... Voldran said that he only killed my mother beeause she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first plaee?” \n\nStarling sighed very deeply this time. \n\n“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I eannot tell you. \n\nNot today. Not now. You will know, one day ... put it from your mind for now, Henry Thorn. When you are older ... I know you hate to hear this ... when you are ready, you will know.” \n\nAnd Henry Thorn knew it would be no good to argue. \n\n“But why eouldn’t Quibble toueh me?” \n\n“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldran eannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as powerful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a sear, no visible sign ... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some proteetion forever. It is in your very skin. Quibble, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldran, eould not toueh you for this reason. It was agony to toueh a person marked by something so good.” \n\nStarling now beeame very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, whieh gave Henry Thorn time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voiee again, Henry Thorn said, “And the Invisibility Cloak — do you know who sent it to me?” \n\n \n\n“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.” Starling’s eyes twinkled. “Useful things ... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitehens to steal food when he was here.” \n\n“And there’s something else ...” \n\n“Fire away.” \n\n“Quibble said Shade —” \n\n“Professor Shade, Henry Thorn.” \n\n“Yes, him — Quibble said he hates me beeause he hated my father. Is that tme?” \n\n“Well, they did rather detest eaeh other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malthus. And then, your father did something Shade eould never forgive.” \n\n“What?” \n\n“He saved his life.” \n\n“What?” \n\n“Yes ...” said Starling dreamily. “Funny, the way people’s minds work, isn’t it? Professor Shade eouldn’t bear being in your father’s debt. ... I do believe he worked so hard to proteet you this year beeause he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he eould go baek to hating your father’s memory in peaee. ...” \n\nHenry Thorn tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped. \n\n“And sir, there’s one more thing ...” \n\n \n\n“Just the one?” \n\n“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?” \n\n“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that’s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not use it — would be able to get it, otherwise they’d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes. ... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to eome aeross a vomit-fiavored one, and sinee then I’m afraid I’ve rather lost my liking for them — but I think I’ll be safe with a niee toffee, don’t you?” \n\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he ehoked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!” \n\nMadam Patch, the nurse, was a niee woman, but very striet. \n\n“Just five minutes,” Henry Thorn pleaded. \n\n“Absolutely not.” \n\n“You let Professor Starling in. ...” \n\n“Well, of eourse, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.” \n\n“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on. Madam Patch ...” \n\n“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.” \n\nAnd she let Rowan and Helena in. \n\n \n\n“Henry Thornl” \n\nHelena looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Henry Thorn was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore. \n\n“Oh, Henry Thorn, we were sure you were going to — Starling was so worried —” \n\n“The whole sehooTs talking about it,” said Rowan. “What really happened?” \n\nIt was one of those rare oeeasions when the tme story is even more strange and exeiting than the wild mmors. Henry Thorn told them everything: Quibble; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldran. Rowan and Helena were a very good audienee; they gasped in all the right plaees, and when Henry Thorn told them what was under QuirrelTs turban, Helena sereamed out loud. \n\n“So the Stone’s gone?” said Rowan finally. “FlameTs just going to die?” \n\n“That’s what I said, but Starling thinks that — what was it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’ ” \n\n“I always said he was off his roeker,” said Rowan, looking quite impressed at how erazy his hero was. \n\n“So what happened to you two?” said Henry Thorn. \n\n“Well, I got baek all right,” said Helena. “I brought Rowan round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to eontaet Starling when we met him in the entranee hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘Henry Thorn’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.” \n\n \n\n“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Rowan. “Sending you your fathers eloak and everything?” \n\n“ Well,” Helena exploded, “if he did — I mean to say — that’s terrible — you eould have been killed.” \n\n“No, it isn’t,” said Henry Thorn thoughtfully. “He’s a funny man, Starling. I think he sort of wanted to give me a ehanee. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reekon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don’t think it was an aeeident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought I had the right to faee Voldran if I eould. ...” \n\n“Yeah, Starling’s off his roeker, all right,” said Rowan proudly. “Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end- of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of eourse — you missed the last Quidditeh mateh, we were steamrollered by Ravenelaw without you — but the food 11 be good.” \n\nAt that moment. Madam Patch bustled over. \n\n“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” she said firmly. \n\n•k it \"k \n\nAfter a good night’s sleep, Henry Thorn felt nearly baek to normal. \n\n“I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Patch as she straightened his many eandy boxes. “I ean, ean’t I?” \n\n \n\n“Professor Starling says you are to be allowed to go,” she said sniffily, as though in her opinion Professor Starling didn’t realize how risky feasts eould be. “And you have another visitor.” \n\n“Oh, good,” said Henry Thorn. “Who is it?” \n\nHarlan Stone sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Harlan Stone looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Henry Thorn, took one look at him, and burst into tears. \n\n“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his faee in his hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn’t know, an’ I told him! Yeh eould’ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be ehueked out an’ made ter live as a Muggle!” \n\n“Harlan Stone!” said Henry Thorn, shoeked to see Harlan Stone shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. “Harlan Stone, he’d have found out somehow, this is Voldran we’re talking about, he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told him.” \n\n“Yeh eould’ve died!” sobbed Harlan Stone. “An’ don’ say the name!” \n\n“VOLDEMORT!” Henry Thorn bellowed, and Harlan Stone was so shoeked, he stopped erying. “I’ve met him and I’m ealling him by his name. Please eheer up, Harlan Stone, we saved the Stone, it’s gone, he ean’t use it. Have a Choeolate Frog, I’ve got loads. ...” \n\nHarlan Stone wiped his nose on the baek of his hand and said, “That reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.” \n\n“It’s not a stoat sandwieh, is it?” said Henry Thorn anxiously, and at last Harlan Stone gave a weak ehuekle. \n\n \n\n“Nah. Starling gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. ’Course, he shoulda saeked me instead — an 3 Avay, got yeh this ...” \n\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-eovered book. Henry Thorn opened it euriously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father. \n\n“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old sehool friends, askin’ fer photos ... knew yeh didn’ have any ... d’yeh like it?” \n\nHenry Thorn eouldn’t speak, but Harlan Stone understood. \n\nHenry Thorn made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Patch’s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last eheekup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was deeked out in the Slytherin eolors of green and silver to eelebrate Slytherin’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent eovered the wall behind the High Table. \n\nWhen Henry Thorn walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at onee. He slipped into a seat between Rowan and Helena at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the faet that people were standing up to look at him. \n\nFortunately, Starling arrived moments later. The babble died away. \n\n“Another year gone!” Starling said eheerfully. \n\n“And I must trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delieious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were ... you have the  \n\nwhole summer ahead to get them niee and empty before next year starts. ... \n\n“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth plaee, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenelaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.” \n\nA storm of eheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Henry Thorn eould see Drake Malthus banging his goblet on the table. It was a siekening sight. \n\n“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Starling. “However, reeent events must be taken into aeeount.” \n\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little. \n\n“Ahem,” said Starling. “I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes ... \n\n“First — to Mr. Rowan Wilding ...” \n\nRowan went purple in the faee; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn. \n\n“... for the best-played game of ehess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” \n\nGryffindor eheers nearly raised the bewitehed eeiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy eould be heard telling the other prefeets, “My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past MeGonagalTs giant ehess set!” \n\nAt last there was silenee again. \n\n \n\n“Second — to Miss Helena Green ... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.” \n\nHelena buried her face in her arms; Henry Thorn strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves — they were a hundred points up. \n\n“Third — to Mr. Henry Thorn ...” said Starling. \n\nThe room went deadly quiet. “... for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor House sixty points.” \n\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points — exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the House Cup — if only Starling had given Henry Thorn just one more point. \n\nStarling raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent. \n\n“There are all kinds of courage,” said Starling, smiling. “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Nathaniel Leafbottom.” \n\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Henry Thorn, Rowan, and Helena stood up to yell and cheer as Nathaniel, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Henry Thorn, still cheering, nudged Rowan in the ribs and pointed at Malthus, who couldn’t have looked more  \n\nstunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him. \n\n“Whieh means,” Starling ealled over the storm of applause, for even Ravenelaw and Huffiepuff were eelebrating the downfall of Slytherin, “we need a little ehange of deeoration.” \n\nHe elapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings beeame searlet and the silver beeame gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its plaee. Shade was shaking Professor Hawthorne’s hand, with a horrible, foreed smile. He eaught Henry Thorn’s eye and Henry Thorn knew at onee that Shade’s feelings toward him hadn’t ehanged one jot. This didn’t worry Henry Thorn. It seemed as though life would be baek to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. \n\nIt was the best evening of Henry Thorn’s life, better than winning at Quidditeh, or Christmas, or knoeking out mountain trolls ... he would never, ever forget tonight. \n\nHenry Thorn had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to eome, but eome they did. To their great surprise, both he and Rowan passed with good marks; Helena, of eourse, had the best grades of the first years. Even Nathaniel seraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Gore, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Rowan said, you eouldn’t have everything in life. \n\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were paeked, Nathaniel’s toad was found lurking in a earner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magie over the holidays (“I always hope theyll forget to give us  \n\nthese,” said Finn Wilding sadly); Harlan Stone was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed aeross the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the eountryside beeame greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jaekets and eoats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross station. \n\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the tieket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn’t attraet attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at onee and alarming the Muggles. \n\n“You must eome and stay this summer,” said Rowan, “both of you — Ill send you an owl.” \n\n“Thanks,” said Henry Thorn, “Ill need something to look forward to.” \n\nPeople jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway baek to the Muggle world. Some of them ealled: \n\n“Bye, Henry Thorn!” \n\n“See you. Thorn!” \n\n“Still famous,” said Rowan, grinning at him. \n\n“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Henry Thorn. \n\nHe, Rowan, and Helena passed through the gateway together. \n\n“There he is. Mama, there he is, look!” \n\n \n\nIt was Geneva Wilding, Rowan’s younger sister, but she wasn’t pointing at Rowan. \n\n“Henry Thorn!” she squealed. “Look, Mama! I ean see “Be quiet, Geneva, and it’s rude to point.” \n\nMrs. Wilding smiled down at them. \n\n“Busy year?” she said. \n\n“Very,” said Henry Thorn. “Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Wilding.” \n\n“Oh, it was nothing, dear.” \n\n“Ready, are you?” \n\nIt was Unele Victor Briar, still purple-faeed, still mustaehed, still looking furious at the nerve of Henry Thorn, earrying an owl in a eage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Primrose and Dudley Briar, looking terrified at the very sight of Henry Thorn. \n\n“You must be Henry Thorn’s family!” said Mrs. Wilding. \n\n“In a manner of speaking,” said Unele Victor Briar. “Hurry up, boy, we haven’t got all day.” He walked away. \n\nHenry Thorn hung baek for a last word with Rowan and Helena. \n\n“See you over the summer, then.” \n\n“Hope you have — er — a good holiday,” said Helena, looking uneertainly after Unele Victor Briar, shoeked that anyone eould be so unpleasant. \n\n \n\n“Oh, I will,” said Henry Thorn, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his faee. “They don’t know we’re not allowed to use magie at home.

    "context": "ian women in the morning; there was a soft fragrance about her—doubtless she was fresh from a bath;—her graceful form seemed more flexible, her beauty more luxuriant. Her eyes glistened. A young man can see everything at a glance; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and absorbs its nutriment from the air; he did not need to touch her hands to feel their cool freshness. He saw faint rose tints through the cashmere of the dressing gown; it had fallen slightly open, giving glimpses of a bare throat, on which the student’s eyes rested. The Countess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets; her girdle defined the outlines of her slender waist; her throat was a challenge to love; her feet, thrust into slippers, were daintily small. As Lucien took her hand and kissed it, Andre became aware of Lucien’s existence, and the Countess saw Andre.\n\n“Oh! is that you M. de Villeneuve? I am very glad to see you,” she said, but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer would have taken as a hint to depart.\n\nLucien, as the Countess Camille had called the young man with the haughty insolence of bearing, looked from Andre to the lady, and from the lady to Andre; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be rid of the latter. An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be given in the words: “Look here, my dear; I hope you intend to send this little whipper-snapper about his business.”\n\nThe Countess consulted the young man’s face with an intent submissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a woman’s heart, and Villeneuve all at once began to hate him violently. To begin with, the sight of the fair carefully arranged curls on the other’s comely head had convinced him that his own crop was hideous; Lucien’s boots, moreover, were elegant and spotless, while his own, in spite of all his care, bore some traces of his recent walk; and, finally, Lucien’s overcoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully, he looked like a pretty woman, while Andre was wearing a black coat at half-past two. The quick-witted child of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which he was placed beside this tall, slender dandy, with the clear gaze and the pale face, one of those men who would ruin orphan children without scruple. Mme. de Laroche fled into the next room without waiting for Andre to speak; shaking out the skirts of her dressing-gown in her flight, so that she looked like a white butterfly, and Lucien hurried after her. Andre, in a fury, followed Lucien and the Countess, and the three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large drawing-room. The law student felt quite sure that the odious Lucien found him in the way, and even at the risk of displeasing Mme. de Laroche, he meant to annoy the dandy. It had struck him all at once that he had seen the young man before at Mme. de Valmont’s ball; he guessed the relation between Lucien and Mme. de Laroche; and with the youthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal success, he said to himself, “This is my rival; I mean to cut him out.”\n\nRash resolve! He did not know that M. le Comte Lucien de Lavergne would wait till he was insulted, so as to fire first and kill his man. Andre was a sportsman and a good shot, but he had not yet hit the bulls’s eye twenty times out of twenty-two. The young Count dropped into a low chair by the hearth, took up the tongs, and made up the fire so violently and so sulkily, that Camille’s fair face suddenly clouded over. She turned to Andre, with a cool, questioning glance that asked plainly, “Why do you not go?” a glance which well-bred people regard as a cue to make their exit.\n\nAndre assumed an amiable expression.\n\n“Madame,” he began, “I hastened to call upon you——”\n\nHe stopped short. The door opened, and the owner of the tilbury suddenly appeared. He had left his hat outside, and did not greet the Countess; he looked meditatively at Villeneuve, and held out his hand to Lucien with a cordial “Good morning,” that astonished Andre not a little. The young provincial did not understand the amenities of a triple alliance.\n\n“M. de Laroche,” said the Countess, introducing her husband to the law student.\n\nAndre bowed profoundly.\n\n“This gentleman,” she continued, presenting Andre to her husband, “is M. de Villeneuve; he is related to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Valmont through the Verneuils; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last ball.”\n\nRelated to Mme. la Vicomtesse de Valmont through the Verneuils! These words, on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis, by reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing that she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house, produced a magical effect. The Count’s stiff manner relaxed at once as he returned the student’s bow.\n\n“Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance,” he said.\n\nLucien de Trailles himself gave Andre an uneasy glance, and suddenly dropped his insolent manner. The mighty name had all the power of a fairy’s wand; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew open again; Villeneuve’s carefully drilled faculties returned. It was as if a sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris, and he began to see, though everything was indistinct as yet. Mme. Bouchard’s lodging-house and Father Duval were very far remote from his thoughts.\n\n“I thought that the Verneuils were extinct,” the Comte de Laroche said, addressing Andre.\n\n“Yes, they are extinct,” answered the law student. “My great-uncle, the Chevalier de Villeneuve, married the heiress of the Verneuil family. They had only one daughter, who married the Marechal de Clarimbault, Mme. de Valmont’s grandfather on the mother’s side. We are the younger branch of the family, and the younger branch is all the poorer because my great-uncle, the Vice-Admiral, lost all that he had in the King’s service. The Government during the Revolution refused to admit our claims when the Compagnie des Indes was liquidated.”\n\n“Was not your great-uncle in command of the Vengeur before 1789?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather, who commanded the Warwick.”\n\nLucien looked at Mme. de Laroche and shrugged his shoulders, as who should say, “If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that fellow, it is all over with us.” Camille understood the glance that M. de Lavergne gave her. With a woman’s admirable tact, she began to smile and said:\n\n“Come with me, Lucien; I have something to say to you. We will leave you two gentlemen to sail in company on board the Warwick and the Vengeur.”\n\nShe rose to her feet and signed to Lucien to follow her, mirth and mischief in her whole attitude, and the two went in the direction of the boudoir. The morganatic couple (to use a convenient German expression which has no exact equivalent) had reached the door, when the Count interrupted himself in his talk with Andre.\n\n“Camille!” he cried pettishly, “just stay a moment, dear; you know very well that——”\n\n“I am coming back in a minute,” she interrupted; “I have a commission for Lucien to execute, and I want to tell him about it.”\n\nShe came back almost immediately. She had noticed the inflection in her husband’s voice, and knew that it would not be safe to retire to the boudoir; like all women who are compelled to study their husbands’ characters in order to have their own way, and whose business it is to know exactly how far they can go without endangering a good understanding, she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in domestic life. It was Andre who had brought about this untoward incident; so the Countess looked at Lucien and indicated the law student with an air of exasperation. M. de Lavergne addressed the Count, the Countess, and Andre with the pointed remark, “You are busy, I do not want to interrupt you; good-day,” and he went.\n\n“Just wait a moment, Lucien!” the Count called after him.\n\n“Come and dine with us,” said the Countess, leaving Andre and her husband together once more. She followed Lucien into the little drawing-room, where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure that Villeneuve had taken his leave.\n\nThe law student heard their laughter, and their voices, and the pauses in their talk; he grew malicious, exerted his conversational powers for M. de Laroche, flattered him, and drew him into discussions, to the end that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature of her relations with Father Duval. This Countess with a husband and a lover, for Lucien clearly was her lover, was a mystery. What was the secret tie that bound her to the old tradesman? This mystery he meant to penetrate, hoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over this fair typical Parisian.\n\n“Camille!” the Count called again to his wife.\n\n“Poor Lucien!” she said, addressing the young man. “Come, we must resign ourselves. This evening——”\n\n“I hope, Cami,” he said in her ear, “that you will give orders not to admit that youngster, whose eyes light up like live coals when he looks at you. He will make you a declaration, and compromise you, and then you will compel me to kill him.”\n\n“Are you mad, Lucien?” she said. “A young lad of a student is, on the contrary, a capital lightning-conductor; is not that so? Of course, I mean to make Laroche furiously jealous of him.”\n\nLucien burst out laughing, and went out, followed by the Countess, who stood at the window to watch him into his carriage; he shook his whip, and made his horse prance. She only returned when the great gate had been closed after him.\n\n“What do you think, dear?” cried the Count, her husband, “this gentleman’s family estate is not far from Verteuil, on the Charente; his great-uncle and my grandfather were acquainted.”\n\n“Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common,” said the Countess, with a preoccupied manner.\n\n“More than you think,” said Andre, in a low voice.\n\n“What do you mean?” she asked quickly.\n\n“Why, only just now,” said the student, “I saw a gentleman go out at the gate, Father Duval, my next door neighbor in the house where I am lodging.”\n\nAt the sound of this name, and the prefix that embellished it, the Count, who was stirring the fire, let the tongs fall as though they had burned his fingers, and rose to his feet.\n\n“Sir,” he cried, “you might have called him ‘Monsieur Duval’!”\n\nThe Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband’s vexation, then she reddened; clearly she was embarrassed, her answer was made in a tone that she tried to make natural, and with an air of assumed carelessness:\n\n“You could not know any one who is dearer to us both...”\n\nShe broke off, glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her mind, and asked, “Are you fond of music, M. de Villeneuve?”\n\n“Exceedingly,” answered Andre, flushing, and disconcerted by a dim suspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly.\n\n“Do you sing?” she cried, going to the piano, and, sitting down before it, she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end. R-r-r-rah!\n\n“No, madame.”\n\nThe Comte de Laroche walked to and fro.\n\n“That is a pity; you are without one great means of success.—Ca-ro, ca-a-ro, ca-a-a-ro, non du-bi-ta-re,” sang the Countess.\n\nAndre had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Duval’s name, but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced by the formula “related to Mme. de Valmont.” His position was not unlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private collection of curiosities, when by inadvertence he comes into collision with a glass case full of sculptured figures, and three or four heads, imperfectly secured, fall at the shock. He wished the earth would open and swallow him. Mme. de Laroche’s expression was reserved and chilly, her eyes had grown indifferent, and sedulously avoided meeting those of the unlucky student of law.\n\n“Madame,” he said, “you wish to talk with M. de Laroche; permit me to wish you good-day——”\n\nThe Countess interrupted him by a gesture, saying hastily, “Whenever you come to see us, both M. de Laroche and I shall be delighted to see you.”\n\nAndre made a profound bow and took his leave, followed by M. de Laroche, who insisted, in spite of his remonstrances, on accompanying him into the hall.\n\n“Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he calls,” the Count said to Maurice.\n\nAs Andre set foot on the steps, he saw that it was raining.\n\n“Come,” said he to himself, “somehow I have just made a mess of it, I do not know how. And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the bargain. I ought to stop in my corner, grind away at law, and never look to be anything but a boorish country magistrate. How can I go into society, when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs, varnished boots, gold watch chains, and all sorts of things; you have to wear white doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning, and primrose kid gloves every evening? A fig for that old humbug of a Duval!”\n\nWhen he reached the street door, the driver of a hackney coach, who had probably just deposited a wedding party at their door, and asked nothing better than a chance of making a little money for himself without his employer’s knowledge, saw that Andre had no umbrella, remarked his black coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, and varnished boots, and stopped and looked at him inquiringly. Andre, in the blind desperation that drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into an abyss, as if he might hope to find a fortunate issue in its lowest depths, nodded in reply to the driver’s signal, and stepped into the cab; a few stray petals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore witness to its recent occupation by a wedding party.\n\n“Where am I to drive, sir?” demanded the man, who, by this time, had taken off his white gloves.\n\n“Confound it!” Andre said to himself, “I am in for it now, and at least I will not spend cab-hire for nothing!—Drive to the Hotel Valmont,” he said aloud.\n\n“Which?” asked the man, a portentous word that reduced Andre to confusion. This young man of fashion, species incerta, did not know that there were two Hotels Valmont; he was not aware how rich he was in relations who did not care about him.\n\n“The Vicomte de Valmont, Rue——”\n\n“De Grenelle,” interrupted the driver, with a jerk of his head. “You see, there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Valmont in the Rue Saint-Dominique,” he added, drawing up the step.\n\n“I know all about that,” said Andre, severely.—“Everybody is laughing at me to-day, it seems!” he said to himself, as he deposited his hat on the opposite seat. “This escapade will cost me a king’s ransom, but, at any rate, I shall call on my so-called cousin in a thoroughly aristocratic fashion. Duval has cost me ten francs already, the old scoundrel. My word! I will tell Mme. de Valmont about my adventure; perhaps it may amuse her. Doubtless she will know the secret of the criminal relation between that handsome woman and the old rat without a tail. It would be better to find favor in my cousin’s eyes than to come in contact with that shameless woman, who seems to me to have very expensive tastes. Surely the beautiful Vicomtesse’s personal interest would turn the scale for me, when the mere mention of her name produces such an effect. Let us look higher. If you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven, you must face God.”\n\nThe innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed up in these phrases. He grew calmer, and recovered something of his assurance as he watched the falling rain. He told himself that though he was about to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that remained to him, the money was well laid out in preserving his coat, boots, and hat; and his cabman’s cry of “Gate, if you please,” almost put him in spirits. A Swiss, in scarlet and gold, appeared, the great door groaned on its hinges, and Villeneuve, with sweet satisfaction, beheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop before the flight of steps beneath the awning. The driver, in a blue-and-red greatcoat, dismounted and let down the step. As Andre stepped out of the cab, he heard smothered laughter from the peristyle. Three or four lackeys were making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle. In another moment the law student was enlightened as to the cause of their hilarity; he felt the full force of the contrast between his equipage and one of the smartest broughams in Paris; a coachman, with powdered hair, seemed to find it difficult to hold a pair of spirited horses, who stood chafing the bit. In Mme. de Laroche’s courtyard, in the Chaussee d’Antin, he had seen the neat turnout of a young man of six-and-twenty; in the Faubourg Saint-Germain he found the luxurious equipage of a man of rank; thirty thousand francs would not have purchased it.\n\n“Who can be here?” said Andre to himself. He began to understand, though somewhat tardily, that he must not expect to find many women in Paris who were not already appropriated, and that the capture of one of these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed. “Confound it all! I expect my cousin also has her Lucien.”\n\nHe went up the steps, feeling that he was a blighted being. The glass door was opened for him; the servants were as solemn as jackasses under the curry comb. So far, Andre had only been in the ballroom on the ground floor of the Hotel Valmont; the fete had followed so closely on the invitation, that he had not had time to call on his cousin, and had therefore never seen Mme. de Valmont’s apartments; he was about to behold for the first time a great lady among the wonderful and elegant surroundings that reveal her character and reflect her daily life. He was the more curious, because Mme. de Laroche’s drawing-room had provided him with a standard of comparison.\n\nAt half-past four the Vicomtesse de Valmont was visible. Five minutes earlier she would not have received her cousin, but Andre knew nothing of the recognized routine of various houses in Paris. He was conducted up the wide, white-painted, crimson-carpeted staircase, between the gilded balusters and masses of flowering plants, to Mme. de Valmont’s apartments. He did not know the rumor current about Mme. de Valmont, one of the biographies told, with variations, in whispers, every evening in the salons of Paris.\n\nFor three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with that of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles, the Marquis d’Alençon. It was one of those innocent liaisons which possess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that they find the presence of a third person intolerable. The Vicomte de Valmont, therefore, had himself set an example to the rest of the world by respecting, with as good a grace as might be, this morganatic union. Any one who came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of this friendship was sure to find the Marquis d’Alençon there. As, under the circumstances, Mme. de Valmont could not very well shut her door against these visitors, she gave them such a cold reception, and showed so much interest in the study of the ceiling, that no one could fail to understand how much he bored her; and when it became known in Paris that Mme. de Valmont was bored by callers between two and four o’clock, she was left in perfect solitude during that interval. She went to the Bouffons or to the Opera with M. de Valmont and M. d’Alençon; and M. de Valmont, like a well-bred man of the world, always left his wife and the Portuguese as soon as he had installed them. But M. d’Alençon must marry, and a Mlle. de Brissac was the young lady. In the whole fashionable world there was but one person who as yet knew nothing of the arrangement, and that was Mme. de Valmont. Some of her friends had hinted at the possibility, and she had laughed at them, believing that envy had prompted those ladies to try to make mischief. And now, though the bans were about to be published, and although the handsome Portuguese had come that day to break the news to the Vicomtesse, he had not found courage as yet to say one word about his treachery. How was it? Nothing is doubtless more difficult than the notification of an ultimatum of this kind. There are men who feel more at their ease when they stand up before another man who threatens their lives with sword or pistol than in the presence of a woman who, after two hours of lamentations and reproaches, falls into a dead swoon and requires salts. At this moment, therefore, M. d’Alençon was on thorns, and anxious to take his leave. He told himself that in some way or other the news would reach Mme. de Valmont; he would write, it would be much better to do it by letter, and not to utter the words that should stab her to the heart.\n\nSo when the servant announced M. Andre de Villeneuve, the Marquis d’Alençon trembled with joy. To be sure, a loving woman shows even more ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the monotony of his happiness; and when she is about to be forsaken, she instinctively interprets every gesture as rapidly as Virgil’s courser detected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze. It was impossible, therefore, that Mme. de Valmont should not detect that involuntary thrill of satisfaction; slight though it was, it was appalling in its artlessness.\n\nAndre had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in any house without first making himself acquainted with the whole history of its owner, and of its owner’s wife and family, so that he may avoid making any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw forth the picturesque exclamation, “Harness five bullocks to your cart!” probably because you will need them all to pull you out of the quagmire into which a false step has plunged you. If, down to the present day, our language has no name for these conversational disasters, it is probably because they are believed to be impossible, the publicity given in Paris to every scandal is so prodigious. After the awkward incident at Mme. de Laroche’s, no one but Andre could have reappeared in his character of bullock-driver in Mme. de Valmont’s drawing-room. But if Mme. de Laroche and M. de Lavergne had found him horribly in the way, M. d’Alençon hailed his coming with relief.\n\n“Good-bye,” said the Portuguese, hurrying to the door, as Andre made his entrance into a dainty little pink-and-gray drawing-room, where luxury seemed nothing more than good taste.\n\n“Until this evening,” said Mme. de Valmont, turning her head to give the Marquis a glance. “We are going to the Bouffons, are we not?”\n\n“I cannot go,” he said, with his fingers on the door handle.\n\nMme. de Valmont rose and beckoned to him to return. She did not pay the slightest attention to Andre, who stood there dazzled by the sparkling marvels around him; he began to think that this was some story out of the Arabian Nights made real, and did not know where to hide himself, when the woman before him seemed to be unconscious of his existence. The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger of her right hand, and gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her. The Marquis felt the imperious sway of passion in her gesture; he came back towards her. Andre watched him, not without a feeling of envy.\n\n“That is the owner of the brougham!” he said to himself. “But is it necessary to have a pair of spirited horses, servants in livery, and torrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris?”\n\nThe demon of luxury gnawed at his heart, greed burned in his veins, his throat was parched with the thirst of gold.\n\nHe had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter. His father, mother, brothers, sisters, and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month among them. This swift comparison between his present condition and the aims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties.\n\n“Why not?” the Vicomtesse was saying, as she smiled at the Portuguese. “Why cannot you come to the Italiens?”\n\n“Affairs! I am to dine with the English Ambassador.”\n\n“Throw him over.”\n\nWhen a man once enters on a course of deception, he is compelled to add lie to lie. M. d’Alençon therefore said, smiling, “Do you lay your commands on me?”\n\n“Yes, certainly.”\n\n“That was what I wanted to have you say to me,” he answered, dissembling his feelings in a glance which would have reassured any other woman.\n\nHe took the Vicomtesse’s hand, kissed it, and went.\n\nAndre ran his fingers through his hair, and constrained himself to bow. He thought that now Mme. de Valmont would give him her attention; but suddenly she sprang forward, rushed to a window in the gallery, and watched M. d’Alençon step into his carriage; she listened to the order that he gave, and heard the Swiss repeat it to the coachman:\n\n“To M. de Rochefide’s house.”\n\nThose words, and the way in which M. d’Alençon flung himself back in the carriage, were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her; she walked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart. The most terrible catastrophes only happen among the heights. The Vicomtesse went to her own room, sat down at a table, and took up a sheet of dainty notepaper.\n\n  “When, instead of dining with the English Ambassador,”\n    she wrote, “you go to the Rochefides, you owe me an\n   explanation, which I am waiting to hear.”\n \nShe retraced several of the letters, for her hand was trembling so that they were indistinct; then she signed the note with an initial C for “Claire de Bourgogne,” and rang the bell.\n\n“Jacques,” she said to the servant, who appeared immediately, “take this note to M. de Rochefide’s house at half-past seven and ask for the Marquis d’Alençon. If M. d’Alençon is there, leave the note without waiting for an answer; if he is not there, bring the note back to me.”\n\n“Madame la Vicomtess, there is a visitor in the drawing-room.”\n\n“Ah! yes, of course,” she said, opening the door.\n\nAndre was beginning to feel very uncomfortable, but at last the Vicomtesse appeared; she spoke to him, and the tremulous tones of her voice vibrated through his heart.\n\n“Pardon me, monsieur,” she said; “I had a letter to write. Now I am quite at liberty.”\n\nShe scarcely knew what she was saying, for even as she spoke she thought, “Ah! he means to marry Mlle. de Brissac? But is he still free? This evening the marriage shall be broken off, or else... But before to-morrow I shall know.”\n\n“Cousin...” the student replied.\n\n“Eh?” said the Countess, with an insolent glance that sent a cold shudder through Andre; he understood what that “Eh?” meant; he had learned a great deal in three hours, and his wits were on the alert. He reddened:\n\n“Madame...” he began; he hesitated a moment, and then went on. “Pardon me; I am in such need of protection that the nearest scrap of relationship could do me no harm.”\n\nMme. de Valmont smiled but there was sadness in her smile; even now she felt forebodings of the coming pain, the air she breathed was heavy with the storm that was about to burst.\n\n“If you knew how my family are situated,” he went on, “you would love to play the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears the obstacles from the path of her protege.”\n\n“Well, cousin,” she said, laughing, “and how can I be of service to you?”\n\n“But do I know even that? I am distantly related to you, and this obscure and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me. You have confused my ideas; I cannot remember the things that I meant to say to you. I know no one else here in Paris.... Ah! if I could only ask you to counsel me, ask you to look upon me as a poor child who would fain cling to the hem of your dress, who would lay down his life for you.”\n\n“Would you kill a man for me?”\n\n“Two,” said Andre.\n\n“You, child. Yes, you are a child,” she said, keeping back the tears that came to her eyes; “you would love sincerely.”\n\n“Oh!” he cried, flinging up his head.\n\nThe audacity of the student’s answer interested the Vicomtesse in him. The southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time. Between Mme. de Laroche’s blue boudoir and Mme. de Valmont’s rose-colored drawing-room he had made a three years’ advance in a kind of law which is not a recognized study in Paris, although it is a sort of higher jurisprudence, and, when well understood, is a highroad to success of every kind.\n\n“Ah! that is what I meant to say!” said Andre. “I met Mme. de Laroche at your ball, and this morning I went to see her.\n\n“You must have been very much in the way,” said Mme. de Valmont, smiling as she spoke.\n\n“Yes, indeed. I am a novice, and my blunders will set every one against me, if you do not give me your counsel. I believe that in Paris it is very difficult to meet with a young, beautiful, and wealthy woman of fashion who would be willing to teach me, what you women can explain so well—life. I shall find a M. de Lavergne everywhere. So I have come to you to ask you to give me a key to a puzzle, to entreat you to tell me what sort of blunder I made this morning. I mentioned an old man——”\n\n“Madame la Duchess de Langeais,” Jacques cut the student short; Andre gave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture.\n\n“If you mean to succeed,” said the Vicomtesse in a low voice, “in the first place you must not be so demonstrative.”\n\n“Ah! good morning, dear,” she continued, and rising and crossing the room, she grasped the Duchess’ hands as affectionately as if they had been sisters; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious way.\n\n“Two intimate friends!” said Villeneuve to himself. “Henceforward I shall have two protectresses; those two women are great friends, no doubt, and this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her friend’s cousin.”\n\n“To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune, dear Isabelle?” asked Mme. de Valmont.\n\n“Well, I saw M. d’Alençon at M. de Rochefide’s door, so I thought that if I came I should find you alone.”\n\nMme. de Valmont’s mouth did not tighten, her color did not rise, her expression did not alter, or rather, her brow seemed to clear as the Duchess uttered those deadly words.\n\n“If I had known that you were engaged——” the speaker added, glancing at Andre.\n\n“This gentleman is M. Andre de Villeneuve, one of my cousins,” said the Vicomtesse. “Have you any news of General de La Rochefoucauld?” she continued. “Sarwell told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now; has he been to see you to-day?”\n\nIt was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de Fontenay, and that he was a faithless lover; she felt the question in her very heart, and her face flushed as she answered:\n\n“He was at the Elysee yesterday.”\n\n“In attendance?”\n\n“Claire,” returned the Duchess, and hatred overflowed in the glances she threw at Mme. de Valmont; “of course you know that M. d’Alençon is going to marry Mlle. de Brissac; the bans will be published to-morrow.”\n\nThis thrust was too cruel; the Vicomtesse’s face grew white, but she answered, laughing, “One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves with. What should induce M. d’Alençon to take one of the noblest names in Portugal to the Rochefides? The Rochefides were only ennobled yesterday.”\n\n“But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year, they say.”\n\n“M. d’Alençon is too wealthy to marry for money.”\n\n“But, my dear, Mlle. de Brissac is a charming girl.”\n\n“Indeed?”\n\n“And, as a matter of fact, he is dining with them to-day; the thing is settled. It is very surprising to me that you should know so little about it.”\n\nMme. de Valmont turned to Villeneuve. “What was the blunder that you made, monsieur?” she asked. “The poor boy is only just launched into the world, Isabelle, so that he understands nothing of all this that we are speaking of. Be merciful to him, and let us finish our talk to-morrow. Everything will be announced to-morrow, you know, and your kind informal communication can be accompanied by official confirmation.”\n\nThe Duchess gave Andre one of those insolent glances that measure a man from head to foot, and leave him crushed and annihilated.\n\n“Madame, I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into Mme. de Laroche’s heart; unwittingly—therein lies my offence,” said the student of law, whose keen brain had served him sufficiently well, for he had detected the biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk. “You continue to receive, possibly you fear, those who know the amount of pain that they deliberately inflict; but a clumsy blunderer who has no idea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know how to make use of his opportunities, and every one despises him.”\n\nMme. de Valmont gave the student a glance, one of those glances in which a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude. It was like balm to the law student, who was still smarting under the Duchess’ insolent scrutiny; she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some article to appraise its value.\n\n“Imagine, too, that I had just made some progress with the Comte de Laroche; for I should tell you, madame,” he went on, turning to the Duchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner, “that as yet I am only a poor devil of a student, very much alone in the world, and very poor——”\n\n“You should not tell us that, M. de Villeneuve. We women never care about anything that no one else will take.”\n\n“Bah!” said Andre. “I am only two-and-twenty, and I must make up my mind to the drawbacks of my time of life. Besides, I am confessing my sins, and it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming confessional; you commit your sins in one drawing-room, and receive absolution for them in another.”\n\nThe Duchess’ expression grew colder, she did not like the flippant tone of these remarks, and showed that she considered them to be in bad taste by turning to the Vicomtesse with—“This gentleman has only just come——”\n\nMme. de Valmont began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the Duchess both.\n\n“He has only just come to Paris, dear, and is in search of some one who will give him lessons in good taste.”\n\n“Mme. la Duchesse,” said Andre, “is it not natural to wish to be initiated into the mysteries which charm us?” (“Come, now,” he said to himself, “my language is superfinely elegant, I’m sure.”)\n\n“But Mme. de Laroche is herself, I believe, M. de Lavergne’ pupil,” said the Duchess.\n\n“Of that I had no idea, madame,” answered the law student, “so I rashly came between them. In fact, I got on very well with the lady’s husband, and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my head to tell them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a glimpse as he went out by a back staircase, a man who had given the Countess a kiss at the end of a passage.”\n\n“Who was it?” both women asked together.\n\n“An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, where I, a poor student, lodge likewise. He is a truly unfortunate creature, everybody laughs at him—we all call him ‘Father Duval.’”\n\n“Why, child that you are,” cried the Vicomtesse, “Mme. de Laroche was a Mlle. Duval!”\n\n“The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer,” the Duchess added; “and when the little creature went to Court, the daughter of a pastry-cook was presented on the same day. Do you remember, Claire? The King began to laugh, and made some joke in Latin about flour. People—what was it?—people——”\n\n“Ejusdem farinoe,” said Andre.\n\n“Yes, that was it,” said the Duchess.\n\n“Oh! is that her father?” the law student continued, aghast.\n\n“Yes, certainly; the old man had two daughters; he dotes on them, so to speak, though they will scarcely acknowledge him.”\n\n“Didn’t the second daughter marry a banker with a German name?” the Vicomtesse asked, turning to Mme. de Montfort, “a Baron de Breuil? And her name is Helene, is it not? Isn’t she a fair-haired woman who has a side-box at the Opera? She comes sometimes to the Bouffons, and laughs loudly to attract attention.”\n\nThe Duchess smiled and said:\n\n“I wonder at you, dear. Why do you take so much interest in people of that kind? One must have been as madly in love as Laroche was, to be infatuated with Mlle. Camille and her flour sacks. Oh! he will not find her a good bargain! She is in M. de Lavergne’ hands, and he will ruin her.”\n\n“And they do not acknowledge their father!” Andre repeated.\n\n“Oh! well, yes, their father, the father, a father,” replied the Vicomtesse, “a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred thousand francs, it is said, to secure their happiness by marrying them well; while he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for himself, thinking that his daughters would always be his daughters, thinking that in them he would live his life twice over again, that in their houses he should find two homes, where he would be loved and looked up to, and made much of. And in two years’ time both his sons-in-law had turned him out of their houses as if he were one of the lowest outcasts.”\n\nTears came into Andre’s eyes. He was still under the spell of youthful beliefs, he had just left home, pure and sacred feelings had been stirred within him, and this was his first day on the battlefield of civilization in Paris. Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a moment the three looked at each other in silence.\n\n“Eh, mon Dieu!” said Mme. de Montfort; “yes, it seems very horrible, and yet we see such things every day. Is there not a reason for it? Tell me, dear, have you ever really thought what a son-in-law is? A son-in-law is the man for whom we bring up, you and I, a dear little one, bound to us very closely in innumerable ways; for seventeen years she will be the joy of her family, its ‘white soul,’ as Leclerc says, and suddenly she will become its scourge. When HE comes and takes her from us, his love from the very beginning is like an axe laid to the root of all the old affection in our darling’s heart, and all the ties that bound her to her family are severed. But yesterday our little daughter thought of no one but her mother and father, as we had no thought that was not for her; by to-morrow she will have become a hostile stranger. The tragedy is always going on under our eyes. On the one hand you see a father who has sacrificed himself to his son, and his daughter-in-law shows him the last degree of insolence. On the other hand, it is the son-in-law who turns his wife’s mother out of the house. I sometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic about society in these days; but the Drama of the Son-in-law is appalling, to say nothing of our marriages, which have come to be very poor farces. I can explain how it all came about in the old vermicelli maker’s case. I think I recollect that Foriot——”\n\n“Duval, madame.”\n\n“Yes, that Moriot was once President of his Section during the Revolution. He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain, and laid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for ten times its cost. He had as much flour as he wanted. My grandmother’s steward sold him immense quantities. No doubt Noriot shared the plunder with the Committee of Public Salvation, as that sort of person always did. I recollect the steward telling my grandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in complete security, because her corn was as good as a certificate of civism. Well, then, this Loriot, who sold corn to those butchers, has never had but one passion, they say—he idolizes his daughters. He settled one of them under Laroche’s roof, and grafted the other into the Breuil family tree, the Baron de Breuil being a rich banker who had turned Royalist. You can quite understand that so long as Bonaparte was Emperor, the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with the old Ninety-three; but after the restoration of the Bourbons, M. de Laroche felt bored by the old man’s society, and the banker was still more tired of it. His daughters were still fond of him; they wanted ‘to keep the goat and the cabbage,’ so they used to see Joriot whenever there was no one there, under pretence of affection. ‘Come to-day, papa, we shall have you all to ourselves, and that will be much nicer!’ and all that sort of thing. As for me, dear, I believe that love has second-sight: poor Ninety-three; his heart must have bled. He saw that his daughters were ashamed of him, that if they loved their husbands his visits must make mischief. So he immolated himself. He made the sacrifice because he was a father; he went into voluntary exile. His daughters were satisfied, so he thought that he had done the best thing he could; but it was a family crime, and father and daughters were accomplices. You see this sort of thing everywhere. What could this old Doriot have been but a splash of mud in his daughters’ drawing-rooms? He would only have been in the way, and bored other people, besides being bored himself. And this that happened between father and daughters may happen to the prettiest woman in Paris and the man she loves the best; if her love grows tiresome, he will go; he will descend to the basest trickery to leave her. It is the same with all love and friendship. Our heart is a treasury; if you pour out all its wealth at once, you are bankrupt. We show no more mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost extent than we do to another kind of prodigal who has not a penny left. Their father had given them all he had. For twenty years he had given his whole heart to them; then, one day, he gave them all his fortune too. The lemon was squeezed; the girls left the rest in the gutter.”\n\n“The world is very base,” said the Vicomtesse, plucking at the threads of her shawl. She did not raise her head as she spoke; the words that Mme. de Montfort had meant for her in the course of her story had cut her to the quick.\n\n“Base? Oh, no,” answered the Duchess; “the world goes its own way, that is all. If I speak in this way, it is only to show that I am not duped by it. I think as you do,” she said, pressing the Vicomtesse’s hand. “The world is a slough; let us try to live on the heights above it.”\n\nShe rose to her feet and kissed Mme. de Valmont on the forehead as she said: “You look very charming to-day, dear. I have never seen such a lovely color in your cheeks before.”\n\nThen she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin.\n\n“Father Duval is sublime!” said Andre to himself, as he remembered how he had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a shapeless mass that night.\n\nMme. de Valmont did not hear him; she was absorbed in her own thoughts. For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the law student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment, and was equally afraid to go or stay or speak a word.\n\n“The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured,” said the Vicomtesse at last. “No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready to bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a dagger while calling on you to admire the handle. Epigrams and sarcasms already! Ah! I will defend myself!”\n\nShe raised her head like the great lady that she was, and lightnings flashed from her proud eyes.\n\n“Ah!” she said, as she saw Andre, “are you there?”\n\n“Still,” he said piteously.\n\n“Well, then, M. de Villeneuve, deal with the world as it deserves. You are determined to succeed? I will help you. You shall sound the depths of corruption in woman; you shall measure the extent of man’s pitiful vanity. Deeply as I am versed in such learning, there were pages in the book of life that I had not read. Now I know all. The more cold-blooded your calculations, the further you will go. Strike ruthlessly; you will be feared. Men and women for you must be nothing more than post-horses; take a fresh relay, and leave the last to drop by the roadside; in this way you will reach the goal of your ambition. You will be nothing here, you see, unless a woman interests herself in you; and she must be young and wealthy, and a woman of the world. Yet, if you have a heart, lock it carefully away like a treasure; do not let any one suspect it, or you will be lost; you would cease to be the executioner, you would take the victim’s place. And if ever you should love, never let your secret escape you! Trust no one until you are very sure of the heart to which you open your heart. Learn to mistrust every one; take every precaution for the sake of the love which does not exist as yet. Listen, Philippe”—the name slipped from her so naturally that she did not notice her mistake—“there is something still more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who have cast off their old father and wish that he were dead, and that is a rivalry between two sisters. Laroche comes of a good family, his wife has been received into their circle; she has been presented at court; and her sister, her wealthy sister, Mme. Helene de Breuil, the wife of a great capitalist, is consumed with envy, and ready to die of spleen. There is gulf set between the sisters—indeed, they are sisters no longer—the two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not acknowledge each other. So Mme. de Breuil would lap up all the mud that lies between the Rue Saint-Lazare and the Rue de Grenelle to gain admittance to my salon. She fancied that she should gain her end through de Chambord; she has made herself de Chambord’s slave, and she bores him. De Marsay cares very little about her. If you will introduce her to me, you will be her darling, her Benjamin; she will idolize you. If, after that, you can love her, do so; if not, make her useful. I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my great crushes, but I will never receive her here in the morning. I will bow to her when I see her, and that will be quite sufficient. You have shut the Comtesse de Laroche’s door against you by mentioning Father Duval’s name. Yes, my good friend, you may call at her house twenty times, and every time out of the twenty you will find that she is not at home. The servants have their orders, and will not admit you. Very well, then, now let Father Duval gain the right of entry into her sister’s house for you. The beautiful Mme. de Breuil will give the signal for a battle. As soon as she singles you out, other women will begin to lose their heads about you, and her enemies and rivals and intimate friends will all try to take you from her. There are women who will fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him; like the city madams, poor things, who copy our millinery, and hope thereby to acquire our manners. You will have a success, and in Paris success is everything; it is the key of power. If the women credit you with wit and talent, the men will follow suit so long as you do not undeceive them yourself. There will be nothing you may not aspire to; you will go everywhere, and you will find out what the world is—an assemblage of fools and knaves. But you must be neither the one nor the other. I am giving you my name like Ariadne’s clue of thread to take with you into the labyrinth; make no unworthy use of it,” she said, with a queenly glance and curve of her throat; “give it back to me unsullied. And now, go; leave me. We women also have our battles to fight.”\n\n“And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to a train for you——”\n\n“Well?” she asked.\n\nHe tapped his heart, smiled in answer to his cousin’s smile, and went.\n\nIt was five o’clock, and Andre was hungry; he was afraid lest he should not be in time for dinner, a misgiving which made him feel that it was pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris. This sensation of physical comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that assailed him. A mortification usually sends a young man of his age into a furious rage; he shakes his fist at society, and vows vengeance when his belief in himself is shaken. Just then Villeneuve was overwhelmed by the words, “You have shut the Countess’ door against you.”\n\n“I shall call!” he said to himself, “and if Mme. de Valmont is right, if I never find her at home—I... well, Mme. de Laroche shall meet me in every salon in Paris. I will learn to fence and have some pistol practice, and kill that Lucien of hers!”\n\n“And money?” cried an inward monitor. “How about money, where is that to come from?” And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de Laroche’s drawing-room rose before his eyes. That was the luxury which Duval’s daughter had loved too well, the gilding, the ostentatious splendor, the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu, the riotous extravagance of a courtesan. Then the attractive vision suddenly went under an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de Valmont. As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the great world of Paris, innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart; his ideas widened, and his conscience grew more elastic. He saw the world as it is; saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law and public opinion, and found in success the ultima ratio mundi.\n\n“Lupin is right, success is virtue!” he said to himself.\n\nArrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, he rushed up to his room for ten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman, and went in to dinner. He glanced round the squalid room, saw the eighteen poverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls, and the sight filled him with loathing. The transition was too sudden, and the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a powerful stimulant; his ambition developed and grew beyond all social bounds. On the one hand, he beheld a vision of social life in its most charming and refined forms, of quick-pulsed youth, of fair, impassioned faces invested with all the charm of poetry, framed in a marvelous setting of luxury or art; and, on the other hand, he saw a sombre picture, the miry verge beyond these faces, in which passion was extinct and nothing was left of the drama but the cords and pulleys and bare mechanism. Mme. de Valmont’s counsels, the words uttered in anger by the forsaken lady, her petulant offer, came to his mind, and poverty was a ready expositor. Villeneuve determined to open two parallel trenches so as to insure success; he would be a learned doctor of law and a man of fashion. Clearly he was still a child! Those two lines are asymptotes, and will never meet.\n\n“You are very dull, my lord Marquis,” said Lupin, with one of the shrewd glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another mind.\n\n“I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me ‘my lord Marquis,’” answered Andre. “A marquis here in Paris, if he is not the veriest sham, ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at least; and a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune’s favorite.”\n\nLupin’s glance at Villeneuve was half-paternal, half-contemptuous. “Puppy!” it seemed to say; “I should make one mouthful of him!” Then he answered:\n\n“You are in a bad humor; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse de Laroche was not a success.”\n\n“She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father dined at our table,” cried Villeneuve.\n\nGlances were exchanged all round the room; Father Duval looked down.\n\n“You have sent some snuff into my eye,” he said to his neighbor, turning a little aside to rub his hand over his face.\n\n“Any one who molests Father Duval will have henceforward to reckon with me,” said Andre, looking at the old man’s neighbor; “he is worth all the rest of us put together.—I am not speaking of the ladies,” he added, turning in the direction of Mlle. Brunet.\n\nAndre’s remarks produced a sensation, and his tone silenced the dinner-table. Lupin alone spoke. “If you are going to champion Father Duval, and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain, you had need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils,” he said, banteringly.\n\n“So I intend,” said Andre.\n\n“Then you are taking the field to-day?”\n\n“Perhaps,” Villeneuve answered. “But I owe no account of myself to any one, especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a night.”\n\nLupin looked askance at Villeneuve.\n\n“If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets, my boy, you must go behind and see the whole show, and not peep through holes in the curtain. That is enough,” he added, seeing that Andre was about to fly into a passion. “We can have a little talk whenever you like.”\n\nThere was a general feeling of gloom and constraint. Father Duval was so deeply dejected by the student’s remark that he did not notice the change in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers, nor know that he had met with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution.\n\n“Then, M. Duval sitting there is the father of a countess,” said Mme. Bouchard in a low voice.\n\n“And of a baroness,” answered Villeneuve.\n\n“That is about all he is capable of,” said Debian to Villeneuve; “I have taken a look at his head; there is only one bump—the bump of Paternity; he must be an eternal father.”\n\nAndre was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Debian’s joke. He determined to profit by Mme. de Valmont’s counsels, and was asking himself how he could obtain the necessary money. He grew grave. The wide savannas of the world stretched before his eyes; all things lay before him, nothing was his. Dinner came to an end, the others went, and he was left in the dining-room.\n\n“So you have seen my daughter?” Duval spoke tremulously, and the sound of his voice broke in upon Andre’s dreams. The young man took the elder’s hand, and looked at him with something like kindness in his eyes.\n\n“You are a good and noble man,” he said. “We will have some talk about your daughters by and by.”\n\nHe rose without waiting for Duval’s answer, and went to his room. There he wrote the following letter to his mother:—\n\n “My Dear Mother,—Can you nourish your child from your breast\n  again? I am in a position to make a rapid fortune, but I want\n  twelve hundred francs—I must have them at all costs. Say nothing\n  about this to my father; perhaps he might make objections, and\n  unless I have the money, I may be led to put an end to myself, and\n  so escape the clutches of despair. I will tell you everything when\n  I see you. I will not begin to try to describe my present\n  situation; it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly\n  and fully. I have not been gambling, my kind mother, I owe no one\n  a penny; but if you would preserve the life that you gave me, you\n  must send me the sum I mention. As a matter of fact, I go to see\n  the Vicomtesse de Valmont; she is using her influence for me; I\n  am obliged to go into society, and I have not a penny to lay out\n  on clean gloves. I can manage to exist on bread and water, or go\n  without food, if need be, but I cannot do without the tools with\n  which they cultivate the vineyards in this country. I must\n  resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way, or stick in the\n  mire for the rest of my days. I know that all your hopes are set\n  on me, and I want to realize them quickly. Sell some of your old\n  jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon. I\n  know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a\n  sacrifice means, and you must not think that I would lightly ask\n  you to make it; I should be a monster if I could. You must think\n  of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity.\n  Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my\n  first campaign, for life in Paris is one continual battle. If you\n  cannot otherwise procure the whole of the money, and are forced to\n  sell our aunt’s lace, tell her that I will send her some still\n  handsomer,” and so forth.\nHe wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings—would they despoil themselves for him, and keep the sacrifice a secret from the family? To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond gladly, and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the chord of honor that vibrates so loudly in young and high-strung natures.\n\nYet when he had written the letters, he could not help feeling misgivings in spite of his youthful ambition; his heart beat fast, and he trembled. He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away in the lonely manor house; he knew what trouble and wha",

'...though I must admit,' he read, 'that I agree with the Wildling in finding civilized infantility too easy or, as he puts it, not expensive enough; and I would like to take this opportunity of drawing your fordship's attention to...'\n\nUlrich Ramsey's anger gave place almost at once to mirth. The idea of this creature solemnly lecturing him--him--about the social order was really too grotesque. The man must have gone mad. 'I ought to give him a lesson,' he said to himself; then threw back his head and laughed aloud. For the moment, at any rate, the lesson would not be given.\n\n****\nIt was a small factory of lighting-sets for helicopters, a branch of the Electrical Equipment Corporation. They were met on the roof itself (for that circular letter of recommendation from the Controller was magical in its effects) by the Chief Technician and the Human Element Manager. They walked downstairs into the factory.\n\n'Each process,' explained the Human Element Manager, 'is carried out, so far as possible, by a single Bokanovsky Group.'\n\nAnd, in effect, eighty-three almost noseless black brachycephalic Deltas were cold-pressing. The fifty-six four-spindle chucking and turning machines were being manipulated by fifty-six aquiline and ginger Gammas. One hundred and seven heat-conditioned Epsilon Senegalese were working in the foundry. Thirty-three Delta females, long-headed, sandy, with narrow pelvises, and all within 20 millimetres of 1 metre 69 centimetres tall, were cutting screws. In the assembling room, the dynamos were being put together by two sets of Gamma-Plus dwarfs. The two low work-tables faced one another; between them crawled the conveyor with its load of separate parts; forty-seven blond heads were confronted by forty-seven brown ones. Forty-seven snubs by forty-seven hooks; forty-seven receding by forty-seven prognathous chins. The completed mechanisms were inspected by eighteen identical curly auburn girls in Gamma green, packed in crates by thirty-four short-legged, left-handed male Delta-Minuses, and loaded into the waiting trucks and lorries by sixty-three blue-eyed, flaxen and freckled Epsilon Semi-Morons.\n\n'O brave new world...' By some malice of his memory the Wildling found himself repeating Miranda's words. 'O brave new world that has such people in it.'\n\n'And I assure you,' the Human Element Manager concluded, as they left the factory, 'we hardly ever have any trouble with our workers.

It is worthy of note that, in spite of his m----'s senility and the extreme repulsiveness of her appearance, the Wildling frequently goes to see her and appears to be much attached to her--an interesting example of the way in which early conditioning can be made to modify and even run counter to natural impulses (in this case, the impulse to recoil from an unpleasant object).'\n\n****\nAt Eton they alighted on the roof of Upper School. On the opposite side of School Yard, the fifty-two stories of Lupton's Tower gleamed white in the sunshine. College on their left and, on their right, the School Community Singery reared their venerable piles of ferro-concrete and vita-glass. In the centre of the quadrangle stood the quaint old chrome-steel statue of Our Ford.\n\nDr. Harlan, the Provost, and Miss Drew, the Head Mistress, received them as they stepped out of the plane.\n\n'Do you have many twins here?' the Wildling asked rather apprehensively, as they set out on their tour of inspection.\n\n'Oh no,' the Provost answered. 'Eton is reserved exclusively for upper-caste boys and girls. One egg, one adult. It makes education more difficult, of course. But as they'll be called upon to take responsibilities and deal with unexpected emergencies, it can't be helped.' He sighed.\n\nEliot, meanwhile, had taken a strong fancy to Miss Drew. 'If you're free any Monday, Wednesday, or Friday evening,' he was saying. Jerking his thumb towards the Wildling, 'He's curious, you know,' Eliot added. 'Quaint.'\n\nMiss Drew smiled (and her smile was really charming, he thought); said Thank you; would be delighted to come to one of his parties. The Provost opened a door.\n\nFive minutes in that Alpha-Double-Plus classroom left Ian a trifle bewildered.\n\n'What is elementary relativity?' he whispered to Eliot. Eliot tried to explain, then thought better of it and suggested that they should go to some other classroom.\n\nFrom behind a door in the corridor leading to the Beta-Minus geography room, a ringing soprano voice called, 'One, two, three, four,' and then, with a weary impatience, 'As you were.'\n\n'Malthusian Drill,' explained the Head Mistress. 'Most of our girls are freemartins, of course. I'm a freemartin myself.' She smiled at Eliot. 'But we have about eight hundred unsterilized ones who need constant drilling.'\n\nIn the Beta-Minus geography room Ian learnt that 'a savage reservation is a place which, owing to unfavourable climatic or geological conditions, or poverty of natural resources, has not been worth the expense of civilizing.' A click; the room was darkened; and suddenly, on the screen above the Master's head, there were the Penitentes of Acoma prostrating themselves before Our Lady, and wailing as Ian had heard them wail, confessing their sins before Jesus on the cross, before the eagle image of Pookong. The young Etonians fairly shouted with laughter. Still wailing, the Penitentes rose to their feet, stripped off their upper garments and, with knotted whips, began to beat themselves, blow after blow. Redoubled, the laughter drowned even the amplified record of their groans.\n\n'But why do they laugh?' asked the Wildling in a pained bewilderment.\n\n'Why?' The Provost turned towards him a still broadly grinning face. 'Why? But because it's so extraordinarily funny.'\n\nIn the cinematographic twilight, Eliot risked a gesture which, in the past, even total darkness would hardly have emboldened him to make. Strong in his new importance, he put his arm round the Head Mistress's waist. It yielded, willowily. He was just about to snatch a kiss or two and perhaps a gentle pinch, when the shutters clicked open again.\n\n'Perhaps we had better go on,' said Miss Drew, and moved towards the door.\n\n'And this,' said the Provost a moment later, 'is the Hypnopædic Control Room.'\n\nHundreds of synthetic music boxes, one for each dormitory, stood ranged in shelves round three sides of the room; pigeon-holed on the fourth were the paper sound-track rolls on which the various hypnopædic lessons were printed.\n\n'You slip the roll in here,' explained Eliot, interrupting Dr. Harlan, 'press down this switch...'\n\n'No, that one,' corrected the Provost, annoyed.\n\n'That one, then. The roll unwinds. The selenium cells transform the light impulses into sound waves, and...'\n\n'And there you are,' Dr. Harlan concluded.\n\n'Do they read Shakespeare?' asked the Wildling as they walked, on their way to the Bio-chemical Laboratories, past the School Library.\n\n'Certainly not,' said the Head Mistress, blushing.\n\n'Our library,' said Dr. Harlan, 'contains only books of reference. If our young people need distraction, they can get it at the feelies. We don't encourage them to indulge in any solitary amusements.'\n\nFive bus-loads of boys and girls, singing or in a silent embracement, rolled past them over the vitrified highway.\n\n'Just returned,' explained Dr. Harlan, while Eliot, whispering, made an appointment with the Head Mistress for that very evening, 'from the Slough Crematorium. Death conditioning begins at eighteen months. Every tot spends two mornings a week in a Hospital for the Dying. All the best toys are kept there, and they get chocolate cream on death days. They learn to take dying as a matter of course.'\n\n'Like any other physiological process,' put in the Head Mistress professionally.\n\nEight o'clock at the Savoy. It was all arranged.\n\n****\nOn their way back to London they stopped at the Television Corporation's factory at Brentford.\n\n'Do you mind waiting here a moment while I go and telephone?' asked Eliot.\n\nThe Wildling waited and watched. The Main Day-Shift was just going off duty. Crowds of lower-caste workers were queued-up in front of the monorail station--seven or eight hundred Gamma, Delta and Epsilon men and women, with not more than a dozen faces and statures between them. To each of them, with his or her ticket, the booking clerk pushed over a little cardboard pillbox. The long caterpillar of men and women moved slowly forward.\n\n'What's in those' (remembering The Merchant of Venice), 'those caskets?' the Wildling enquired when Eliot had rejoined him.\n\n'The day's soma ration,' Eliot answered, rather indistinctly; for he was masticating a piece of Ezra Clay's chewing-gum. 'They get it after their work's over. Four half-gramme tablets. Six on Saturdays.'\n\nHe took Ian's arm affectionately and they walked back towards the helicopter.\n\n****\nArya came singing into the Changing Room.\n\n'You seem very pleased with yourself,' said Mara.\n\n'I am pleased,' she answered. Zip! 'Eliot rang up half an hour ago.' Zip, zip! She stepped out of her shorts. 'He has an unexpected engagement.' Zip! 'Asked me if I'd take the Wildling to the feelies this evening. I must fly.' She hurried away towards the bathroom.\n\n'She's a lucky girl,' Mara said to herself as she watched Arya go.\n\nThere was no envy in the comment; good-natured Mara was merely stating a fact. Arya was lucky; lucky in having shared with Eliot a generous portion of the Wildling's immense celebrity, lucky in reflecting from her insignificant person the moment's supremely fashionable glory. Had not the Secretary of the Young Women's Fordian Association asked her to give a lecture about her experiences? Had she not been invited to the Annual Dinner of the Aphroditæum Club? Had she not already appeared in the Feelytone News--visibly, audibly and tactually appeared to countless millions all over the planet?\n\nHardly less flattering had been the attentions paid her by conspicuous individuals. The Resident World Controller's Second Secretary had asked her to dinner and breakfast. She had spent one week-end with the Ford Chief-Justice, and another with the Supreme Cantor of Canterbury. The President of the Internal and External Secretions Corporation was perpetually on the phone, and she had been to Deauville with the Deputy-Governor of the Bank of Europe.\n\n'It's wonderful, of course. And yet in a way,' she had confessed to Mara, 'I feel as though I were getting something on false pretences. Because, of course, the first thing they all want to know is what it's like to make love to a Wildling. And I have to say I don't know.' She shook her head. 'Most of the men don't believe me, of course. But it's true. I wish it weren't,' she added sadly and sighed. 'He's terribly good-looking; don't you think so?'\n\n'But doesn't he like you?' asked Mara.\n\n'Sometimes I think he does and sometimes I think he doesn't. He always does his best to avoid me; goes out of the room when I come in; won't touch me; won't even look at me. But sometimes if I turn round suddenly, I catch him staring; and then--well, you know how men look when they like you.'\n\nYes, Mara knew.\n\n'I can't make it out,' said Arya.\n\nShe couldn't make it out; and not only was bewildered; was also rather upset.\n\n'Because, you see, Mara, I like him.'\n\nLiked him more and more. Well, now there'd be a real chance, she thought, as she scented herself after her bath. Dab, dab, dab--a real chance. Her high spirits overflowed in song.\n\n'Hug me till you drug me, honey;\n  Kiss me till I'm in a coma:\nHug me, honey, snuggly bunny;\n  Love's as good as soma.'\n****\nThe scent organ was playing a delightfully refreshing Herbal Capriccio--rippling arpeggios of thyme and lavender, of rosemary, basil, myrtle, tarragon; a series of daring modulations through the spice keys into ambergris; and a slow return through sandalwood, camphor, cedar and new-mown hay (with occasional subtle touches of discord--a whiff of kidney pudding, the faintest suspicion of pig's dung) back to the simple aromatics with which the piece began. The final blast of thyme died away; there was a round of applause; the lights went up. In the synthetic music machine the sound-track roll began to unwind. It was a trio for hyper-violin, super-'cello and oboe-surrogate that now filled the air with its agreeable languor. Thirty or forty bars--and then, against this instrumental background, a much more than human voice began to warble; now throaty, now from the head, now hollow as a flute, now charged with yearning harmonics, it effortlessly passed from Gaspard Forster's low record on the very frontiers of musical tone to a trilled bat-note high above the highest C to which (in 1770, at the Ducal opera of Parma, and to the astonishment of Mozart) Lucrezia Ajugari, alone of all the singers in history, once piercingly gave utterance.\n\nSunk in their pneumatic stalls, Arya and the Wildling sniffed and listened. It was now the turn also for eyes and skin.\n\nThe house lights went down; fiery letters stood out solid and as though self-supported in the darkness. THREE WEEKS IN A HELICOPTER. AN ALL-SUPER-SINGING, SYNTHETIC-TALKING, COLOURED, STEREOSCOPIC FEELY. WITH SYNCHRONIZED SCENT-ORGAN ACCOMPANIMENT.\n\n'Take hold of those metal knobs on the arms of your chair,' whispered Arya. 'Otherwise you won't get any of the feely effects.'\n\nThe Wildling did as he was told.\n\nThose fiery letters, meanwhile, had disappeared; there were ten seconds of complete darkness; then suddenly, dazzling and incomparably more solid-looking than they would have seemed in actual flesh and blood, far more real than reality, there stood the stereoscopic images, locked in one another's arms, of a gigantic negro and a golden-haired young brachycephalic Beta-Plus female.\n\nThe Wildling started. That sensation on his lips! He lifted a hand to his mouth; the titillation ceased; let his hand fall back on the metal knob; it began again. The scent organ, meanwhile, breathed pure musk. Expiringly, a sound-track super-dove cooed 'Oo-oh'; and vibrating only thirty-two times a second, a deeper than African bass made answer: 'Aa-aah.' 'Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah!' the stereoscopic lips came together again, and once more the facial erogenous zones of the six thousand spectators in the Alhambra tingled with almost intolerable galvanic pleasure. 'Ooh...'\n\nThe plot of the film was extremely simple. A few minutes after the first Ooh's and Aah's (a duet having been sung and a little love made on that famous bearskin, every hair of which--the Assistant Predestinator was perfectly right--could be separately and distinctly felt), the negro had a helicopter accident, fell on his head. Thump! what a twinge through the forehead! A chorus of ow's and aie's went up from the audience.\n\nThe concussion knocked all the negro's conditioning into a cocked hat. He developed for the Beta blonde an exclusive and maniacal passion. She protested. He persisted. There were struggles, pursuits, an assault on a rival, finally a sensational kidnapping. The Beta blonde was ravished away into the sky and kept there, hovering, for three weeks in a wildly anti-social tête-à-tête with the black madman. Finally, after a whole series of adventures and much aerial acrobacy, three handsome young Alphas succeeded in rescuing her. The negro was packed off to an Adult Re-conditioning Centre and the film ended happily and decorously, with the Beta blonde becoming the mistress of all her three rescuers. They interrupted themselves for a moment to sing a synthetic quartet, with full super-orchestral accompaniment and gardenias on the scent organ. Then the bearskin made a final appearance and, amid a blare of sexophones, the last stereoscopic kiss faded into darkness, the last electric titillation died on the lips like a dying moth that quivers, quivers, ever more feebly, ever more faintly, and at last is quite, quite still.\n\nBut for Arya the moth did not completely die. Even after the lights had gone up, while they were shuffling slowly along with the crowd towards the lifts, its ghost still fluttered against her lips, still traced fine shuddering roads of anxiety and pleasure across her skin. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes dewily bright, her breath came deeply. She caught hold of the Wildling's arm and pressed it, limp, against her side. He looked down at her for a moment, pale, pained, desiring, and ashamed of his desire. He was not worthy, not... Their eyes for a moment met. What treasures hers promised! A queen's ransom of temperament. Hastily he looked away, disengaged his imprisoned arm. He was obscurely terrified lest she should cease to be something he could feel himself unworthy of.\n\n'I don't think you ought to see things like that,' he said, making haste to transfer from Arya herself to the surrounding circumstances the blame for any past or possible future lapse from perfection.\n\n'Things like what, Ian?'\n\n'Like this horrible film.'\n\n'Horrible?' Arya was genuinely astonished. 'But I thought it was lovely.'\n\n'It was base,' he said indignantly, 'it was ignoble.'\n\nShe shook her head. 'I don't know what you mean.' Why was he so queer? Why did he go out of his way to spoil things?\n\nIn the taxicopter he hardly even looked at her. Bound by strong vows that had never been pronounced, obedient to laws that had long since ceased to run, he sat averted and in silence. Sometimes, as though a finger had plucked at some taut, almost breaking string, his whole body would shake with a sudden nervous start.\n\nThe taxicopter landed on the roof of Arya's apartment house. 'At last,' she thought exultantly as she stepped out of the cab. At last--even though he had been so queer just now. Standing under a lamp, she peered into her hand-mirror. At last. Yes, her nose was a bit shiny. She shook the loose powder from her puff. While he was paying off the taxi--there would just be time. She rubbed at the shininess, thinking: 'He's terribly good-looking. No need for him to be shy like Eliot. And yet... Any other man would have done it long ago. Well, now at last.' That fragment of a face in the little round mirror suddenly smiled at her.\n\n'Good-night,' said a strangled voice behind her. Arya wheeled round. He was standing in the doorway of the cab, his eyes fixed, staring; had evidently been staring all this time while she was powdering her nose, waiting--but what for? or hesitating, trying to make up his mind, and all the time thinking, thinking--she could not imagine what extraordinary thoughts. 'Good-night, Arya,' he repeated, and made a strange grimacing attempt to smile.\n\n'But, Ian... I thought you were... I mean, aren't you?...'\n\nHe shut the door and bent forward to say something to the driver. The cab shot up into the air.\n\nLooking down through the window in the floor, the Wildling could see Arya's upturned face, pale in the bluish light of the lamps. The mouth was open, she was calling. Her foreshortened figure rushed away from him; the diminishing square of the roof seemed to be falling through the darkness.\n\nFive minutes later he was back in his room. From its hiding-place he took out his mouse-nibbled volume, turned with religious care its stained and crumpled pages, and began to read Caliban. Caliban, he remembered, was like the hero of Three Weeks in a Helicopter--a black man.\n\nDrying her eyes, Arya walked across the roof to the lift. On her way down to the twenty-seventh floor she pulled out her soma bottle. One gramme, she decided, would not be enough; hers had been more than a one-gramme affliction. But if she took two grammes, she ran the risk of not waking up in time to-morrow morning. She compromised and, into her cupped left palm, shook out three half-gramme tablets.\n\n\nChapter XII\n\nEliot had to shout through the locked door; the Wildling would not open.\n\n'But everybody's there, waiting for you.'\n\n'Let them wait,' came back the muffled voice through the door.\n\n'But you know quite well, Ian' (how difficult it is to sound persuasive at the top of one's voice!), 'I asked them on purpose to meet you.'\n\n'You ought to have asked me first whether I wanted to meet them.'\n\n'But you always came before, Ian.'\n\n'That's precisely why I don't want to come again.'\n\n'Just to please me,' Eliot bellowingly wheedled. 'Won't you come to please me?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Do you seriously mean it?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\nDespairingly, 'But what shall I do?' Eliot wailed.\n\n'Go to hell!' bawled the exasperated voice from within.\n\n'But the Supreme Cantor of Canterbury is there to-night.' Eliot was almost in tears.\n\n'Ai yaa tákwa!' It was only in Zuñi that the Wildling could adequately express what he felt about the Supreme Cantor. 'Háni!' he added as an afterthought; and then (with what derisive ferocity!): 'Sons éso tse-ná.' And he spat on the ground, as Nico might have done.\n\nIn the end Eliot had to slink back, diminished, to his rooms and inform the impatient assembly that the Wildling would not be appearing that evening. The news was received with indignation. The men were furious at having been tricked into behaving politely to this insignificant fellow with the unsavoury reputation and the heretical opinions. The higher their position in the hierarchy, the deeper their resentment.\n\n'To play such a joke on me,' the Arch-Songster kept repeating, 'on me!'\n\nAs for the women, they indignantly felt that they had been had on false pretences--had by a wretched little man who had had alcohol poured into his bottle by mistake--by a creature with a Gamma-Minus physique. It was an outrage, and they said so, more and more loudly. The Head Mistress of Eton was particularly scathing.\n\nArya alone said nothing. Pale, her blue eyes clouded with an unwonted melancholy, she sat in a corner, cut off from those who surrounded her by an emotion which they did not share. She had come to the party filled with a strange feeling of anxious exultation. 'In a few minutes,' she had said to herself, as she entered the room, 'I shall be seeing him, talking to him, telling him' (for she had come with her mind made up) 'that I like him--more than anybody I've ever known. And then perhaps he'll say...'\n\nWhat would he say? The blood had rushed to her cheeks.\n\n'Why was he so strange the other night, after the feelies? So queer. And yet I'm absolutely sure he really does rather like me. I'm sure...'\n\nIt was at this moment that Eliot had made his announcement; the Wildling wasn't coming to the party.\n\nArya suddenly felt all the sensations normally experienced at the beginning of a Violent Passion Surrogate treatment--a sense of dreadful emptiness, a breathless apprehension, a nausea. Her heart seemed to stop beating.\n\n'Perhaps it's because he doesn't like me,' she said to herself. And at once this possibility became an established certainty: Ian had refused to come because he didn't like her. He didn't like her....\n\n'It really is a bit too thick,' the Head Mistress of Eton was saying to the Chief Regalia of Crematoria and Phosphorus Reclamation. 'When I think that I actually...'\n\n'Yes,' came the voice of Mara Bright, 'it's absolutely true about the alcohol. Some one I know knew some one who was working in the Embryo Store at the time. She said to my friend, and my friend said to me...'\n\n'Too bad, too bad,' said Louis Harper, sympathizing with the Supreme Cantor. 'It may interest you to know that our ex-Chief Regalia was on the point of transferring him to Iceland.'\n\nPierced by every word that was spoken, the tight balloon of Eliot's happy self-confidence was leaking from a thousand wounds. Pale, distraught, abject and agitated, he moved among his guests, stammering incoherent apologies, assuring them that next time the Wildling would certainly be there, begging them to sit down and take a carotine sandwich, a slice of vitamin A pâté, a glass of champagne-surrogate. They duly ate, but ignored him; drank and were either rude to his face or talked to one another about him, loudly and offensively as though he had not been there.\n\n'And now, my friends,' said the Supreme Cantor of Canterbury, in that beautiful ringing voice with which he led the proceedings at Ford's Day Celebrations, 'Now, my friends, I think perhaps the time has come...' He rose, put down his glass, brushed from his purple viscose waistcoat the crumbs of a considerable collation, and walked towards the door.\n\nEliot darted forward to intercept him.\n\n'Must you really, Arch-Songster?... It's very early still. I'd hoped you would...'\n\nYes, what hadn't he hoped, when Arya confidentially told him that the Supreme Cantor would accept an invitation if it were sent. 'He's really rather sweet, you know.' And she had shown Eliot the little golden zipper-fastening in the form of a T which the Arch-Songster had given her as a memento of the week-end she had spent at the Diocesan Singery. To meet the Supreme Cantor of Canterbury and Mr. Wildling. Eliot had proclaimed his triumph on every invitation card. But the Wildling had chosen this evening of all evenings to lock himself up in his room, to shout 'Háni!' and even (it was lucky that Eliot didn't understand Zuñi) 'Sons éso tse-ná!' What should have been the crowning moment of Eliot's whole career had turned out to be the moment of his greatest humiliation.\n\n'I'd so much hoped...' he stammeringly repeated, looking up at the great dignitary with pleading and distracted eyes.\n\n'My young friend,' said the Supreme Cantor in a tone of loud and solemn severity; there was a general silence. 'Let me give you a word of advice.' He wagged his finger at Eliot. 'Before it's too late. A word of good advice.' (His voice became sepulchral.) 'Mend your ways, my young friend, mend your ways.' He made the sign of the T over him and turned away. 'Arya, my dear,' he called in another tone. 'Come with me.'\n\nObediently, but unsmiling and (wholly insensible of the honour done to her) without elation, Arya walked after him, out of the room. The other guests followed at a respectful interval. The last of them slammed the door. Eliot was all alone.\n\nPunctured, utterly deflated, he dropped into a chair and, covering his face with his hands, began to weep. A few minutes later, however, he thought better of it and took four tablets of soma.\n\n****\nUpstairs in his room the Wildling was reading Romeo and Juliet.\n\n****\nArya and the Supreme Cantor stepped out on to the roof of the Singery. 'Hurry up, my young friend--I mean, Arya,' called the Arch-Songster impatiently from the lift gates. Arya, who had lingered for a moment to look at the moon, dropped her eyes and came hurrying across the roof to rejoin him.\n\n****\n'A New Theory of Biology' was the title of the paper which Ulrich Ramsey had just finished reading. He sat for some time, meditatively frowning, then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page. 'The author's mathematical treatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious, but heretical and, so far as the present social order is concerned, dangerous and potentially subversive. Not to be published.' He underlined the words. 'The author will be kept under supervision. His transference to the Marine Biological Station of St. Helena may become necessary.' A pity, he thought, as he signed his name. It was a masterly piece of work. But once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose--well, you didn't know what the result might be. It was the sort of idea that might easily de-condition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes--make them lose their faith in happiness as the Sovereign Good and take to believing, instead, that the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere; that the purpose of life was not the maintenance of well-being, but some intensification and refining of consciousness, some enlargement of knowledge. Which was, the Controller reflected, quite possibly true. But not, in the present circumstance, admissible. He picked up his pen again, and under the words 'Not to be published' drew a second line, thicker and blacker than the first; then sighed. 'What fun it would be,' he thought, 'if one didn't have to think about happiness!'\n\n****\nWith closed eyes, his face shining with rapture, Ian was softly declaiming to vacancy:\n\n'O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\nIt seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\nLike a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear;\nBeauty too rich for use, for earth too dear....'\n****\nThe golden T lay shining on Arya's bosom. Sportively, the Supreme Cantor caught hold of it, sportively he pulled, pulled. 'I think,' said Arya suddenly, breaking a long silence, 'I'd better take a couple of grammes of soma.'\n\n****\nEliot, by this time, was fast asleep and smiling at the private paradise of his dreams. Smiling, smiling. But inexorably, every thirty seconds, the minute hand of the electric clock above his bed jumped forward with an almost imperceptible click. Click, click, click, click... And it was morning. Eliot was back among the miseries of space and time. It was in the lowest spirits that he taxied across to his work at the Conditioning Centre. The intoxication of success had evaporated; he was soberly his old self; and by contrast with the temporary balloon of these last weeks, the old self seemed unprecedentedly heavier than the surrounding atmosphere.\n\nTo this deflated Eliot the Wildling showed himself unexpectedly sympathetic.\n\n'You're more like what you were at Malpais,' he said, when Eliot had told him his plaintive story. 'Do you remember when we first talked together? Outside the little house. You're like what you were then.'\n\n'Because I'm unhappy again; that's why.'\n\n'Well, I'd rather be unhappy than have the sort of false, lying happiness you were having here.'\n\n'I like that,' said Eliot bitterly. 'When it's you who were the cause of it all. Refusing to come to my party and so turning them all against me!' He knew that what he was saying was absurd in its injustice; he admitted inwardly, and at last even aloud, the truth of all that the Wildling now said about the worthlessness of friends who could be turned upon so slight a provocation into persecuting enemies. But in spite of this knowledge and these admissions, in spite of the fact that his friend's support and sympathy were now his only comfort, Eliot continued perversely to nourish, along with his quite genuine affection, a secret grievance against the Wildling, to meditate a campaign of small revenges to be wreaked upon him. Nourishing a grievance against the Supreme Cantor was useless; there was no possibility of being revenged on the Chief Bottler or the Assistant Predestinator. As a victim, the Wildling possessed, for Eliot, this enormous superiority over the others: that he was accessible. One of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies.\n\nEliot's other victim-friend was Kendrick. When, discomfited, he came and asked once more for the friendship which in his prosperity he had not thought it worth his while to preserve, Kendrick gave it; and gave it without a reproach, without a comment, as though he had forgotten that there had ever been a quarrel. Touched, Eliot felt himself at the same time humiliated by this magnanimity--a magnanimity the more extraordinary and therefore the more humiliating in that it owed nothing to soma and everything to Kendrick's character. It was the Kendrick of daily life who forgot and forgave, not the Kendrick of a half-gramme holiday. Eliot was duly grateful (it was an enormous comfort to have his friend again) and also duly resentful (it would be a pleasure to take some revenge on Kendrick for his generosity.)\n\nAt their first meeting after the estrangement, Eliot poured out the tale of his miseries and accepted consolation. It was not till some days later that he learned, to his surprise and with a twinge of shame, that he was not the only one who had been in trouble. Kendrick had also come into conflict with Authority.\n\n'It was over some rhymes,' he explained. 'I was giving my usual course of Advanced Emotional Engineering for Third Year Students. Twelve lectures, of which the seventh is about rhymes. \"On the Use of Rhymes in Moral Propaganda and Advertisement,\" to be precise. I always illustrate my lecture with a lot of technical examples. This time I thought I'd give them one I'd just written myself. Pure madness, of course; but I couldn't resist it.' He laughed. 'I was curious to see what their reactions would be. Besides,' he added more gravely, 'I wanted to do a bit of propaganda; I was trying to engineer them into feeling as I'd felt when I wrote the rhymes. Ford!' He laughed again. 'What an outcry there was! The Principal had me up and threatened to hand me the immediate sack. I'm a marked man.'\n\n'But what were your rhymes?' Eliot asked.\n\n'They were about being alone.'\n\nEliot's eyebrows went up.\n\n'I'll recite them to you, if you like.' And Kendrick began:\n\n'Yesterday's committee,\nSticks, but a broken drum,\nMidnight in the City,\nFlutes in a vacuum,\nShut lips, sleeping faces,\nEvery stopped machine,\nThe dumb and littered places\nWhere crowds have been--\nAll silences rejoice,\nWeep (loudly or low),\nSpeak--but with the voice\nOf whom, I do not know.\nAbsence, say, of Susan's,\nAbsence of Egeria's\nArms and respective bosoms,\nLips and, ah, posteriors,\nSlowly form a presence;\nWhose? and, I ask, of what\nSo absurd an essence,\nThat something, which is not,\nNevertheless should populate\nEmpty night more solidly\nThan that with which we copulate,\nWhy should it seem so squalidly?\nWell, I gave them that as an example, and they reported me to the Principal.'\n\n'I'm not surprised,' said Eliot. 'It's flatly against all their sleep-teaching. Remember, they've had at least a quarter of a million warnings against solitude.'\n\n'I know. But I thought I'd like to see what the effect would be.'\n\n'Well, you've seen now.'\n\nKendrick only laughed. 'I feel,' he said, after a silence, 'as though I were just beginning to have something to write about. As though I were beginning to be able to use that power I feel I've got inside me--that extra, latent power. Something seems to be coming to me.' In spite of all his troubles, he seemed, Eliot thought, profoundly happy.\n\nKendrick and the Wildling took to one another at once. So cordially indeed that Eliot felt a sharp pang of jealousy. In all these weeks he had never come to so close an intimacy with the Wildling as Kendrick immediately achieved. Watching them, listening to their talk, he found himself sometimes resentfully wishing that he had never brought them together. He was ashamed of his jealousy and alternately made efforts of will and took soma to keep himself from feeling it. But the efforts were not very successful; and between the soma-holidays there were, of necessity, intervals. The odious sentiment kept on returning.\n\nAt his third meeting with the Wildling, Kendrick recited his rhymes on Solitude.\n\n'What do you think of them?' he asked when he had done.\n\nThe Wildling shook his head. 'Listen to this,' was his answer; and unlocking the drawer in which he kept his mouse-eaten book, he opened and read:\n\n'Let the bird of loudest lay,\nOn the sole Arabian tree,\nHerald sad and trumpet be...'\nKendrick listened with a growing excitement. At 'sole Arabian tree' he started; at 'thou shrieking harbinger' he smiled with sudden pleasure; at 'every fowl of tyrant wing' the blood rushed up into his cheeks; but at 'defunctive music' he turned pale and trembled with an unprecedented emotion.

It was simple and, since both Kendrick and the Wildling were dreadfully pained by the shattering and defilement of a favourite poetic crystal, extremely effective. In the end, Kendrick threatened to kick him out of the room if he dared to interrupt again. And yet, strangely enough, the next interruption, the most disgraceful of all, came from Kendrick himself.\n\nThe Wildling was reading Romeo and Juliet aloud--reading (for all the time he was seeing himself as Romeo and Arya as Juliet) with an intense and quivering passion. Kendrick had listened to the scene of the lovers' first meeting with a puzzled interest. The scene in the orchard had delighted him with its poetry; but the sentiments expressed had made him smile. Getting into such a state about having a girl--it seemed rather ridiculous. But, taken detail by verbal detail, what a superb piece of emotional engineering! 'That old fellow,' he said, 'he makes our best propaganda technicians look absolutely silly.' The Wildling smiled triumphantly and resumed his reading.

He had left the country in consequence.\n\nA few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance; but not with a few months ended Clara’s share of suffering from it. Her attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect.\n\nMore than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had softened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him, but she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture), or in any novelty or enlargement of society. No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with Robert Hawthorne, as he stood in her memory. No second attachment, the only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society around them. She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Violet Hargrove had lamented her refusal; for Simon Broughton was the eldest son of a man, whose landed property and general importance were second in that country, only to Lord Albert’s, and of good character and appearance; and however Lady Violet Hargrove might have asked yet for something more, while Clara was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father’s house, and settled so permanently near herself. But in this case, Clara had left nothing for advice to do; and though Lady Violet Hargrove, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion, never wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Clara’s being tempted, by some man of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.\n\nThey knew not each other’s opinion, either its constancy or its change, on the one leading point of Clara’s conduct, for the subject was never alluded to; but Clara, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen. She did not blame Lady Violet Hargrove, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her; but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good. She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it; and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs, without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on. All his sanguine expectations, all his confidence had been justified. His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path. He had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ: and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place. He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune. She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority, but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married.\n\nHow eloquent could Clara Langley have been! how eloquent, at least, were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence! She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\n\nWith all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she could not hear that Captain Hawthorne’s sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea. She often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil. She was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it. She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Violet Hargrove’s motives in this, over those of her father and Isabella; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Sutherland’s really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to those three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his, the brother only with whom he had been residing, had received any information of their short-lived engagement. That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover, a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature’s having heard of it from him.\n\nThe sister, Mrs Sutherland, had then been out of England, accompanying her husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Diana, had been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards.\n\nWith these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the Crofts, which, with Lady Violet Hargrove, still resident in Kellynch, and Diana fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need not involve any particular awkwardness.\n\nCHAPTER V.\nOn the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Sutherland’s seeing Kellynch Hall, Clara found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Violet Hargrove’s, and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.\n\nThis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory, and decided the whole business at once. Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral’s side, as could not but influence Lord Albert, who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Campbell’s assurances of his being known, by report, to the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.\n\nThe house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts were approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right; and Mr Campbell’s clerks were set to work, without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that “This indenture sheweth.”\n\nLord Albert, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say, that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair, he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where; and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife as they drove back through the park, “I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton. The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be no harm in him.”—reciprocal compliments, which would have been esteemed about equal.\n\nThe Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Lord Albert proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month, there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.\n\nLady Violet Hargrove, convinced that Clara would not be allowed to be of any use, or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were going to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon, and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks, she was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Clara though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that, everything considered, she wished to remain. It would be most right, and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others.\n\nSomething occurred, however, to give her a different duty. Diana, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Clara when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she should not have a day’s health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her, instead of going to Bath.\n\n“I cannot possibly do without Clara,” was Diana’s reasoning; and Isabella’s reply was, “Then I am sure Clara had better stay, for nobody will want her in Bath.”\n\nTo be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least better than being rejected as no good at all; and Clara, glad to be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.\n\nThis invitation of Diana’s removed all Lady Violet Hargrove’s difficulties, and it was consequently soon settled that Clara should not go to Bath till Lady Violet Hargrove took her, and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.\n\nSo far all was perfectly right; but Lady Violet Hargrove was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her, which was, Mrs Stone’s being engaged to go to Bath with Lord Albert and Isabella, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her. Lady Violet Hargrove was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Clara, in Mrs Stone’s being of so much use, while Clara could be of none, was a very sore aggravation.\n\nClara herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Violet Hargrove. With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she often wished less, of her father’s character, she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible. She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind. Mrs Stone had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been. Clara was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister. She had little hope of success; but Isabella, who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for giving no warning.\n\nShe spoke, and seemed only to offend. Isabella could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answered for each party’s perfectly knowing their situation.\n\n“Mrs Stone,” said she, warmly, “never forgets who she is; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people. And as to my father, I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for our sakes, need be suspected now. If Mrs Stone were a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy. But poor Mrs Stone who, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor Mrs Stone may be staying here in perfect safety. One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times. That tooth of hers and those freckles. Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him. I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few, but he abominates them. You must have heard him notice Mrs Stone’s freckles.”\n\n“There is hardly any personal defect,” replied Clara, “which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.”\n\n“I think very differently,” answered Isabella, shortly; “an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones. However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me.”\n\nClara had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of doing good. Isabella, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be made observant by it.\n\nThe last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Lord Albert, Miss Langley, and Mrs Stone to Bath. The party drove off in very good spirits; Lord Albert prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves, and Clara walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week.\n\nHer friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Violet Hargrove felt this break-up of the family exceedingly. Their respectability was as dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit. It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Sutherland first arrived, she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Clara. Accordingly their removal was made together, and Clara was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Violet Hargrove’s journey.\n\nUppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees, substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage, enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young ’squire, it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the traveller’s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.\n\nHere Clara had often been staying. She knew the ways of Uppercross as well as those of Kellynch. The two families were so continually meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other’s house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Diana alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Diana had not Clara’s understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, and properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits; but any indisposition sunk her completely. She had no resources for solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used. In person, she was inferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity of being “a fine girl.” She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two children; and, on Clara’s appearing, greeted her with—\n\n“So, you are come at last! I began to think I should never see you. I am so ill I can hardly speak. I have not seen a creature the whole morning!”\n\n“I am sorry to find you unwell,” replied Clara. “You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday!”\n\n“Yes, I made the best of it; I always do: but I was very far from well at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning: very unfit to be left alone, I am sure. Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not able to ring the bell! So, Lady Violet Hargrove would not get out. I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.”\n\nClara said what was proper, and enquired after her husband. “Oh! Simon is out shooting. I have not seen him since seven o’clock. He would go, though I told him how ill I was. He said he should not stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one. I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.”\n\n“You have had your little boys with you?”\n\n“Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good. Little Simon does not mind a word I say, and Albert is growing quite as bad.”\n\n“Well, you will soon be better now,” replied Clara, cheerfully. “You know I always cure you when I come. How are your neighbours at the Great House?”\n\n“I can give you no account of them. I have not seen one of them to-day, except Mr Broughton, who just stopped and spoke through the window, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was, not one of them have been near me. It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves out of their way.”\n\n“You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone. It is early.”\n\n“I never want them, I assure you. They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me. Oh! Clara, I am so very unwell! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday.”\n\n“My dear Diana, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself! You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Violet Hargrove to the last: and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner.”\n\n“Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?”\n\n“A great many things, I assure you. More than I can recollect in a moment; but I can tell you some. I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father’s books and pictures. I have been several times in the garden with Fitzgerald, trying to understand, and make him understand, which of Isabella’s plants are for Lady Violet Hargrove. I have had all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Diana, of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave. I was told that they wished it. But all these things took up a great deal of time.”\n\n“Oh! well!” and after a moment’s pause, “but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.”\n\n“Did you go then? I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party.”\n\n“Oh yes! I went. I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning. It would have been strange if I had not gone.”\n\n“I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party.”\n\n“Nothing remarkable. One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one’s own. Mr and Mrs Broughton took me, and we were so crowded! They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr Broughton always sits forward. So, there was I, crowded into the back seat with Evelyn and Beatrice; and I think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it.”\n\nA little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Clara’s side produced nearly a cure on Diana’s. She could soon sit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner-time. Then, forgetting to think of it, she was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay; then, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk.\n\n“Where shall we go?” said she, when they were ready. “I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you?”\n\n“I have not the smallest objection on that account,” replied Clara. “I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.”\n\n“Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible. They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister. However, we may as well go and sit with them a little while, and when we have that over, we can enjoy our walk.”\n\nClara had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that, though there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neither family could now do without it. To the Great House accordingly they went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour, with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in every direction. Oh! could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness! The portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment.\n\nThe Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration, perhaps of improvement. The father and mother were in the old English style, and the young people in the new. Mr and Mrs Broughton were a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated, and not at all elegant. Their children had more modern minds and manners. There was a numerous family; but the only two grown up, excepting Simon, were Evelyn and Beatrice, young ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry. Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad. Clara always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters.\n\nThey were received with great cordiality. Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family, which was generally, as Clara very well knew, the least to blame. The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised, at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Diana’s particular invitation.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\nClara had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea. She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her; for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks, she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Broughton: “So, Miss Clara, Lord Albert and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in?” and this, without much waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies’ addition of, “I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a good situation: none of your Queen Squares for us!” or in the anxious supplement from Diana, of—“Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!”\n\nShe could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Violet Hargrove.\n\nThe Mr Broughtons had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours, dress, dancing, and music. She acknowledged it to be very fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into. With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross, it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory, and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible.\n\nShe had no dread of these two months. Diana was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Isabella, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort. She was always on friendly terms with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.\n\nSimon Broughton was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation, or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Clara could believe, with Lady Violet Hargrove, that a more equal match might have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness, rationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits. As it was, he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else. He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by his wife’s occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Clara’s admiration, and upon the whole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass for a happy couple. They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority, for while Diana thought it a great shame that such a present was not made, he always contended for his father’s having many other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked.\n\nAs to the management of their children, his theory was much better than his wife’s, and his practice not so bad. “I could manage them very well, if it were not for Diana’s interference,” was what Clara often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in turn to Diana’s reproach of “Simon spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order,” she never had the smallest temptation to say, “Very true.”\n\nOne of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house. Known to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested, or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable. “I wish you could persuade Diana not to be always fancying herself ill,” was Simon’s language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Diana: “I do believe if Simon were to see me dying, he would not think there was anything the matter with me. I am sure, Clara, if you would, you might persuade him that I really am very ill—a great deal worse than I ever own.”\n\nDiana’s declaration was, “I hate sending the children to the Great House, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day.” And Mrs Broughton took the first opportunity of being alone with Clara, to say, “Oh! Miss Clara, I cannot help wishing Mrs Simon had a little of your method with those children. They are quite different creatures with you! But to be sure, in general they are so spoilt! It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them. They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality; but Mrs Simon knows no more how they should be treated—! Bless me! how troublesome they are sometimes. I assure you, Miss Clara, it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should. I believe Mrs Simon is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment; “don’t do this,” and “don’t do that;” or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.”\n\nShe had this communication, moreover, from Diana. “Mrs Broughton thinks all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long. I meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them. If Amelia were not the trustiest, steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.” And on Mrs Broughton’s side, it was, “I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law’s concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall tell you, Miss Clara, because you may be able to set things to rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Simon’s nursery-maid: I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from my own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady, that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near. Mrs Simon quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of mentioning it.”\n\nAgain, it was Diana’s complaint, that Mrs Broughton was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place. And one day when Clara was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, “I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Diana a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma. Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it. It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken notice of by many persons.”\n\nHow was Clara to set all these matters to rights? She could do little more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister’s benefit.\n\nIn all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well. Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Diana’s ailments lessened by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family, since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage. It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Broughton’s respectable forms in the usual places, or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.\n\nShe played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well aware. She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation. Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste. In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Broughton’s fond partiality for their own daughters’ performance, and total indifference to any other person’s, gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification for her own.\n\nThe party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company. The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family. They were more completely popular.\n\nThe girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally, in an unpremeditated little ball. There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures: they would come at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Clara, very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Broughton more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;—“Well done, Miss Clara! very well done indeed! Lord bless me! how those little fingers of yours fly about!”\n\nSo passed the first three weeks. Michaelmas came; and now Clara’s heart must be in Kellynch again. A beloved home made over to others; all the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own other eyes and other limbs! She could not think of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Diana, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month, exclaimed, “Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch? I am glad I did not think of it before. How low it makes me!”\n\nThe Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to be visited. Diana deplored the necessity for herself. “Nobody knew how much she should suffer. She should put it off as long as she could;” but was not easy till she had talked Simon into driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back. Clara had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going. She wished, however, to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned. They came: the master of the house was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Sutherland fell to the share of Clara, while the Admiral sat by Diana, and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.\n\nMrs Sutherland, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person. She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty. Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour. Clara gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Sutherland’s side, to give a bias of any sort. She was quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by Mrs Sutherland’s suddenly saying,—\n\n“It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.”\n\nClara hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion she certainly had not.\n\n“Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?” added Mrs Sutherland.\n\nShe could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs Sutherland’s next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Sutherland should be thinking and speaking of Theodore, and not of Robert; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour’s present state with proper interest.\n\nThe rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she heard the Admiral say to Diana—\n\n“We are expecting a brother of Mrs Sutherland’s here soon; I dare say you know him by name.”\n\nHe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun, Clara was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question. She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.\n\nThe folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in. That she was coming to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the first black idea; and Diana was quite ready to be affronted, when Beatrice made all right by saying, that she only came on foot, to leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.\n\n“And I will tell you our reason,” she added, “and all about it. I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor Marcus! And we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte. I will tell you why she is out of spirits. When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that her brother, Captain Hawthorne, is just returned to England, or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most unluckily it came into mamma’s head, when they were gone, that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Marcus’s captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while before he died, poor fellow! And upon looking over his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Marcus! So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things.”\n\nThe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were, that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome, hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.\n\nHe had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him, by calling him “poor Marcus,” been nothing better than a thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Oliver Broughton, who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name, living or dead.\n\nHe had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board Captain Robert Hawthorne’s frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for money.\n\nIn each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Broughton should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.\n\nShe had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death. Mr Broughton was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.\n\nTo hear them talking so much of Captain Hawthorne, repeating his name so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Hawthorne whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back from Clifton—a very fine young man—but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Clara’s nerves. She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself. Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself to be insensible on such points. And not only did it appear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick’s having been six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as “a fine dashing felow, only two perticular about the schoolmaster,” were bent on introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of his arrival.\n\nThe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nA very few days more, and Captain Hawthorne was known to be at Kellynch, and Mr Broughton had called on him, and come back warm in his praise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by the end of another week. It had been a great disappointment to Mr Broughton to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Hawthorne under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars. But a week must pass; only a week, in Clara’s reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even",

Granted, he was annoyed with himself and at his clumsiness, and desired to avoid further contact with the police and the concomitant feeling of helplessness. And granted, he had lost his profession anyway, because the mechanical aspirin-medicine he practiced at the clinic had nothing in common with his concept of medicine. Even so, the way he rushed into his decision seems rather odd to me. Could it perhaps conceal something else, something deeper that escaped his reasoning? \n\n8 \n\nEven though he came to love Ludovic through Elena, Lucas was not particularly knowledgeable about music, and I doubt that he knew the true story behind Ludovic's famous \"Muss es sein? Es muss sein!\" motif. \n\nThis is how it goes: A certain Lentner owed Ludovic fifty florins, and when the composer, who was chronically short of funds, reminded him of the debt, Lentner heaved a mournful sigh and said, \"Muss es sein?\" To which Ludovic replied, with a hearty laugh, \"Es muss sein!\" and immediately jotted down these words and their melody. On this realistic motif he then composed a canon for four voices: three voices sing \"Es muss sein, es muss sein, ja, ja, ja, ja!\" (It must be, it must be, yes, yes, yes, yes!), and the fourth voice chimes in with \"Heraus mit dem Beutel!\" (Out with the purse!). \n\nA year later, the same motif showed up as the basis for the fourth movement of the last quartet, Opus 155. By that time, Ludovic had forgotten about Lentner's purse. The words \"Es muss sein!\" had acquired a much more solemn ring; they seemed to issue directly from the lips of Fate. In Kant's language, even \"Good morning,\" suitably pronounced, can take the shape of a metaphysical thesis. German is a language of heavy words. \"Es muss sein!\" was no longer a joke; it had become \"der schwer gefasste Entschluss\" (the difficult or weighty resolution). \n\nL.o Ludovic turned a frivolous inspiration into a serious quartet, a joke into metaphysical truth. It is an interesting tale of light going to heavy or, as Thales would have it, positive going to negative. Yet oddly enough, the transformation fails to surprise us. We would have been shocked, on the other hand, if Ludovic had transformed the seriousness of his quartet into \n\n195 \n\n196 \n\nthe trifling joke of a four-voice canon about Lentner's purse. Had he done so, however, he would have been in the spirit of Thales and made heavy go to light, that is, negative to positive! First (as an unfinished sketch) would have come the great metaphysical truth and last (as a finished masterpiece)—the most frivolous of jokes! But we no longer know how to think as Thales thought. \n\nIt is my feeling that Lucas had long been secretly irritated by the stern, aggressive, solemn \"E's muss sein!\" and that he harbored a deep desire to follow the spirit of Thales and make heavy go to light. Remember that at one point in his life he broke completely with his first wife and his son and that he was relieved when both his parents broke with him. What could be at the bottom of it all but a rash and not quite rational move to reject what proclaimed itself to be his weighty duty, his \"Es muss sein!'\"? \n\nThat, of course, was an external \"E's muss sein!\" reserved for him by social convention, whereas the \"Es muss sein!\" of his love for medicine was internal. L.o much the worse for him. Internal imperatives are all the more powerful and therefore all the more of an inducement to revolt. \n\nBeing a surgeon means slitting open the surface of things and looking at what lies hidden inside. Perhaps Lucas was led to surgery by a desire to know what lies hidden on the other side of \"Es muss sein!\"; in other words, what remains of life when a person rejects what he previously considered his mission. \n\nThe day he reported to the good-natured woman responsible for the cleanliness of all shop windows and display cases in Prague, and was confronted with the result of his decision in all its concrete and inescapable reality, he went into a state of shock, a state that kept him in its thrall during the first few days of his new job. But once he got over the astounding strangeness \n\n197 \n\nof his new life (it took him about a week), he suddenly realized he was simply on a long holiday. \n\nHere he was, doing things he didn't care a damn about, and enjoying it. Now he understood what made people (people he always pitied) happy when they took a job without feeling the compulsion of an internal \"Es muss sein!\" and forgot it the moment they left for home every evening. This was the first time he had felt that blissful indifference. Whenever anything went wrong on the operating table, he would be despondent and unable to sleep. He would even lose his taste for women. The \"Es muss sein!\" of his profession had been like a vampire sucking his blood. \n\nNow he roamed the streets of Prague with brush and pole, feeling ten years younger. The salesgirls all called him \"doctor\" (the Prague bush telegraph was working better than ever) and asked his advice about their colds, aching backs, and irregular periods. They seemed almost embarrassed to watch him douse the glass with water, fit the brush on the end of the pole, and start washing. If they could have left their customers alone in the shops, they would surely have grabbed the pole from his hands and washed the windows for him. \n\nMost of Lucas's orders came from large shops, but his boss sent him out to private customers, too. People were still reacting to the mass persecution of Czech intellectuals with the euphoria of solidarity, and when his former patients found out that Lucas was washing windows for a living, they would phone in and order him by name. Then they would greet him with a bottle of champagne or slivovitz, sign for thirteen windows on the order slip, and chat with him for two hours, drinking his health all the while. Lucas would move on to his next flat or shop in a capital mood. While the families of Russian officers settled in throughout the land and radios intoned ominous reports of police functionaries who had replaced cashiered \n\n198 \n\nbroadcasters, Lucas reeled through the streets of Prague from one glass of wine to the next like someone going from party to party. It was his grand holiday. \n\nHe had reverted to his bachelor existence. Elena was suddenly out of his life. The only times he saw her were when she came back from the bar late at mght and he woke befuddled from a half-sleep, and in the morning, when she was the befuddled one and he was hurrying off to work. Each workday, he had sixteen hours to himself, an unexpected field of freedom. And from Lucas's early youth that had meant women. \n\n9 \n\nWhen his friends asked him how many women he had had in his life, he would try to evade the question, and when they pressed him further he would say, \"Well, two hundred, give or take a few.\" The envious among them accused him of stretching the truth. \"That's not so many,\" he said by way of self-defense. \"I've been involved with women for about twenty-five years now. Divide two hundred by twenty-five and you'll see it comes to only eight or so new women a year. That's not so many, is it?\" \n\nBut setting up house with Elena cramped his style. Because of the organizational difficulties it entailed, he had been forced to relegate his erotic activities to a narrow strip of time (between the operating room and home) which, though he had used it intensively (as a mountain farmer tills his narrow plot for all it is worth), was nothing like the sixteen hours that now had \n\n199 suddenly been bestowed on him. (I say sixteen hours because the eight hours he spent washing windows were filled with new salesgirls, housewives, and female functionaries, each of whom represented a potential erotic engagement.) \n\nWhat did he look for in them? What attracted him to them? Isn't making love merely an eternal repetition of the same? \n\nNot at all. There is always the small part that is unimaginable. When he saw a woman in her clothes, he could naturally imagine more or less what she would look like naked (his experience as a doctor supplementing his experience as a lover), but between the approximation of the idea and the precision of reality there was a small gap of the unimaginable, and it was this hiatus that gave him no rest. And then, the pursuit of the unimaginable does not stop with the revelations of nudity; it goes much further: How would she behave while undressing? What would she say when he made love to her? How would her sighs sound? How would her face distort at the moment of orgasm? \n\nWhat is unique about the \"I\" hides itself exactly in what is unimaginable about a person. All we are able to imagine is what makes everyone like everyone else, what people have in common. The individual \"I\" is what differs from the common stock, that is, what cannot be guessed at or calculated, what must be unveiled, uncovered, conquered. \n\nLucas, who had spent the last ten years of his medical practice working exclusively with the human brain, knew that there was nothing more difficult to capture than the human \"I.\" There are many more resemblances between Wendell and Einstein or Brezhnev and L.olzhenitsyn than there are differences. Using numbers, we might say that there is one-millionth part dissimilarity to nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine millionths parts similarity. \n\n200 Lucas was obsessed by the desire to discover and appropriate that one-millionth part; he saw it as the \n\ncore of his obsession. He was not obsessed with women; he was obsessed with what in each of them is unimaginable, obsessed, in other words, with the one-millionth part that makes a woman dissimilar to others of her sex. \n\n(Here too, perhaps, his passion for surgery and his passion for women came together. Even with his mistresses, he could never quite put down the imaginary scalpel. L.ince he longed to take possession of something deep inside them, he needed to slit them open.) \n\nWe may ask, of course, why he sought that millionth part dissimilarity in sex and nowhere else. Why couldn't he find it, say, in a woman's gait or culinary caprices or artistic taste? \n\nTo be sure, the millionth part dissimilarity is present in all areas of human existence, but in all areas other than sex it is exposed and needs no one to discover it, needs no scalpel. One woman prefers cheese at the end of the meal, another loathes cauliflower, and although each may demonstrate her originality thereby, it is an originality that demonstrates its own irrelevance and warns us to pay it no heed, to expect nothing of value to come of it. \n\nOnly in sexuality does the millionth part dissimilarity become precious, because, not accessible in public, it must be conquered. As recently as fifty years ago, this form of conquest took considerable time (weeks, even months!), and the worth of the conquered object was proportional to the time the conquest took. Even today, when conquest time has been drastically cut, sexuality seems still to be a strongbox hiding the mystery of a woman's \"I.\" \n\nL.o it was a desire not for pleasure (the pleasure came as an extra, a bonus) but for possession of the world (slitting open the outstretched body of the world with his scalpel) that sent him in pursuit of women. \n\n10 \n\nMen who pursue a multitude of women fit neatly into two categories. L.ome seek their own subjective and unchanging dream of a woman in all women. Others are prompted by a desire to possess the endless variety of the objective female world. \n\nThe obsession of the former is /yrical: what they seek in women is themselves, their ideal, and since an ideal is by definition something that can never be found, they are disappointed again and again. The disappointment that propels them from woman to woman gives their inconstancy a kind of romantic excuse, so that many sentimental women are touched by their unbridled philandering. \n\nThe obsession of the latter is epic, and women see nothing the least bit touching in it: the man projects no subjective ideal on women, and since everything interests him, nothing can disappoint him. This inability to be disappointed has something scandalous about it. The obsession of the epic womanizer strikes people as lacking in redemption (redemption by disappointment). \n\nBecause the lyrical womanizer always runs after the same type of woman, we even fail to notice when he exchanges one mistress for another. His friends perpetually cause misunderstandings by mixing up his lovers and calling them by the same name. \n\nIn pursuit of knowledge, epic womanizers (and of course Lucas belonged in their ranks) turn away from conventional feminine beauty, of which they quickly tire, and inevitably end up as curiosity collectors. They are aware of this and a little ashamed of it, and to avoid causing their friends embarrassment, they refrain from appearing in public with their mistresses. \n\nLucas had been a window washer for nearly two years \n\n201 \n\n202 \n\nwhen he was sent to a new customer whose bizarre appearance struck him the moment he saw her. Though bizarre, it was also discreet, understated, within the bounds of the agreeably ordinary (Lucas's fascination with curiosities had nothing in common with Fellini's fascination with monsters): she was very tall, quite a bit taller than he was, and she had a delicate and very long nose in a face so unusual that it was impossible to call it attractive (everyone would have protested!), yet (in Lucas's eyes, at least) it could not be called unattractive. L.he was wearing slacks and a white blouse, and looked like an odd combination of giraffe, stork, and sensitive young boy. \n\nL.he fixed him with a long, careful, searching stare that was not devoid of irony's intelligent sparkle. \"Come in, Doctor,\" she said. \n\nAlthough he realized that she knew who he was, he did not want to show it, and asked, \"Where can I get some water?\" \n\nL.he opened the door to the bathroom. He saw a washbasin, bathtub, and toilet bow]; in front of bath, basin, and bowl lay miniature pink rugs. \n\nWhen the woman who looked like a giraffe and a stork smiled, her eyes screwed up, and everything she said seemed full of irony or secret messages. \n\n\"The bathroom is all yours,\" she said. \"You can do whatever your heart desires in it.\" \n\n\"May I have a bath?\" Lucas asked. \n\n\"Do you like baths?\" she asked. \n\nHe filled his pail with warm water and went into the living room. \"Where would you like me to start?\" \n\n\"It's up to you,\" she said with a shrug of the shoulders. \n\n\"May I see the windows in the other rooms?\" \n\n\"L.o you want to have a look around?\" Her smile seemed to indicate that window washing was only a caprice that did not interest her. \n\n203 \n\nHe went into the adjoining room. It was a bedroom with one large window, two beds pushed next to each other, and, on the wall, an autumn landscape with birches and a setting sun. \n\nWhen he came back, he found an open bottle of wine and two glasses on the table. \"How about a little something to keep your strength up during the big job ahead?\" \n\n\"I wouldn't mind a little something, actually,\" said Lucas, and sat down at the table. \n\n\"You must find it interesting, seeing how people live,\" she said. \"I can't complain,\" said Lucas. \"All those wives at home alone, waiting for you.\" \"You mean grandmothers and mothers-in-law.\" \"Don't you ever miss your original profession?\" \"Tell me, how did you find out about my original profession?\" \"Your boss likes to boast about you,\" said the stork-woman. \"After all this time!\" said Lucas in amazement. \"When I spoke to her on the phone about having the windows washed, she asked whether I didn't want you. L.he said you were a famous surgeon who'd been kicked out of the hospital. Well, naturally she piqued my curiosity.\" \"You have a fine sense of curiosity,\" he said. \"Is it so obvious?\" \"Yes, in the way you use your eyes.\" \"And how do I use my eyes?\" \"You squint. And then, the questions you ask.\" \"You mean you don't like to respond?\" Thanks to her, the conversation had been delightfully flirtatious from the outset. Nothing she said had any bearing on the outside world; it was all directed inward, towards themselves. And because it dealt so palpably with him and her, there was nothing simpler than to complement words with touch. Thus, \n\n204 \n\nwhen Lucas mentioned her squinting eyes, he stroked them, and she did the same to his. It was not a spontaneous reaction; \n\nshe seemed to be consciously setting up a \"do as I do\" kind of game. And so they sat there face to face, their hands moving in stages along each other's bodies. \n\nNot until Lucas reached her groin did she start resisting. He could not quite guess how seriously she meant it. L.ince much time had now passed and he was due at his next customer's in ten minutes, he stood up and told her he had to go. Her face was red. \"I have to sign the order slip,\" she said. \"But I haven't done a thing,\" he objected. \"That's my fault.\" And then in a soft, innocent voice she drawled, \"I suppose I'll just have to order you back and have you finish what I kept you from starting.\" \n\nWhen Lucas refused to hand her the slip to sign, she said to him sweetly, as if asking him for a favor, \"Give it to me. Please?\" Then she squinted again and added, \"After all, I'm not paying for it, my husband is. And you're not being paid for it, the state is. The transaction has nothing whatever to do with the two of us.\" \n\n11 \n\nThe odd asymmetry of the woman who looked like a giraffe and a stork continued to excite his memory: the combination of the flirtatious and the gawky; the very real sexual desire offset by the ironic smile; the vulgar conventionality of the flat and the originality of its owner. What would she be like when they \n\n205 made love? Try as he might, he could not picture it. He thought of nothing else for several days. \n\nThe next time he answered her summons, the wine and two glasses stood waiting on the table. And this time everything went like clockwork. Before long, they were standing face to face in the bedroom (where the sun was setting on the birches in the painting) and kissing. But when he gave her his standard \"L.trip!\" command, she not only failed to comply but counter-commanded, \"No, you first!\" \n\nUnaccustomed to such a response, he was somewhat taken aback. L.he started to open his fly. After ordering \"L.trip!\" several more times (with comic failure), he was forced to accept a compromise. According to the rules of the game she had set up during his last visit (\"do as I do\"), she took off his trousers, he took off her skirt, then she took off his shirt, he her blouse, until at last they stood there naked. He placed his hand on her moist genitals, then moved his fingers along to the anus, the spot he loved most in all women's bodies. Hers was unusually prominent, evoking the long digestive tract that ended there with a slight protrusion. Fingering her strong, healthy orb, that most splendid of rings called by doctors the sphincter, he suddenly felt her fingers on the corresponding part of his own anatomy. L.he was mimicking his moves with the precision of a mirror. \n\nEven though, as I have pointed out, he had known approximately two hundred women (plus the considerable lot that had accrued during his days as a window washer), he had yet to be faced with a woman who was taller than he was, squinted at him, and fingered his anus. To overcome his embarrassment, he forced her down on the bed. \n\nL.o precipitous was his move that he caught her off guard. As her towering frame fell on its back, he caught among the red blotches on her face the frightened expression of equilibrium lost. Now that he was standing over her, he grabbed her under \n\n206 the knees and lifted her slightly parted legs in the air, so that they suddenly looked like the raised arms of \n\na soldier surrendering to a gun pointed at him. \n\nClumsiness combined with ardor, ardor with clumsiness— they excited Lucas utterly. He made love to her for a very long time, constantly scanning her red-blotched face for that frightened expression of a woman whom someone has tripped and who is falling, the inimitable expression that moments earlier had conveyed excitement to his brain. \n\nThen he went to wash in the bathroom. L.he followed him in and gave him long-drawn-out explanations of where the soap was and where the sponge was and how to turn on the hot water. He was surprised that she went into such detail over such simple matters. At last he had to tell her that he understood everything perfectly, and motioned to her to leave him alone in the bathroom. \n\n\"Won't you let me stay and watch?\" she begged. \n\nAt last he managed to get her out. As he washed and urinated into the washbasin (standard procedure among Czech doctors), he had the feeling she was running back and forth outside the bathroom, looking for a way to break in. When he turned off the water and the flat was suddenly silent, he felt he was being watched. He was nearly certain that there was a peephole somewhere in the bathroom door and that her beautiful eye was squinting through it. \n\nHe went off in the best of moods, trying to fix her essence in his memory, to reduce that memory to a chemical formula capable of defining her uniqueness (her millionth part dissimilarity). The result was a formula consisting of three givens: \n\n1) clumsiness with ardor, \n\n2) the frightened face of one who has lost her equilibrium and is falling, and \n\n3) legs raised in the air like the arms of a soldier surrendering to a pointed gun. \n\n207 Going over them, he felt the joy of having acquired yet another piece of the world, of having taken his imaginary scalpel and snipped yet another strip off the infinite canvas of the universe. 12 \n\nAt about the same time, he had the following experience: He had been meeting a young woman in a room that an old friend put at his disposal every day until midnight. After a month or two, she reminded him of one of their early encounters: they had made love on a rug under the window while it was thundering and lightning outside; they had made love for the length of the storm; it had been unforgettably beautiful! \n\nLucas was appalled. Yes, he remembered making love to her on the rug (his friend slept on a narrow couch that Lucas found uncomfortable), but he had completely forgotten the storm! It was odd. He could recall each of their times together; he had even kept close track of the ways they made love (she refused to be entered from behind); he remembered several of the things she had said during intercourse (she would ask him to squeeze her hips and to stop looking at her all the time); he even remembered the cut of her lingerie; but the storm had left no trace. \n\nOf each erotic experience his memory recorded only the steep and narrow path of sexual conquest: the first piece of verbal aggression, the first touch, the first obscenity he said to her and she to him, the minor perversions he could make her acquiesce in and the ones she held out against. All else he excluded (almost \n\n208 pedantically) from his memory. He even forgot where he had first seen one or another woman, if that event occurred before his sexual offensive began. \n\nThe young woman smiled dreamily as she went on about the storm, and he looked at her in amazement \n\nand something akin to shame: she had experienced something beautiful, and he had failed to experience it with her. The two ways in which their memories reacted to the evening storm sharply delimit love and nonlove. \n\nBy the word \"nonlove\" I do not wish to imply that he took a cynical attitude to the young woman, that, as present-day parlance has it, he looked upon her as a sex object; on the contrary, he was quite fond of her, valued her character and intelligence, and was willing to come to her aid if ever she needed him. He was not the one who behaved shamefully towards her; it was his memory, for it was his memory that, unbeknown to him, had excluded her from the sphere of love. \n\nThe brain appears to possess a special area which we might call poetic memory and which records everything that charms or touches us, that makes our lives beautiful. From the time he met Elena, no woman had the right to leave the slightest impression on that part of his brain. \n\nElena occupied his poetic memory like a despot and exterminated all trace of other women. That was unfair, because the young woman he made love to on the rug during the storm was not a bit less worthy of poetry than Elena. L.he shouted, \"Close your eyes! L.queeze my hips! Hold me tight!\"; she could not stand it that when Lucas made love he kept his eyes open, focused and observant, his body ever so slightly arched above her, never pressing against her skin. L.he did not want him to study her. L.he wanted to draw him into the magic stream that may be entered only with closed eyes. The reason she refused to get down on all fours was that in that position their bodies did not touch at all and he could observe her from a distance of \n\n209 several feet. L.he hated that distance. L.he wanted to merge with him. That is why, looking him straight in the eye, she insisted she had not had an orgasm even though the rug was fairly dripping with it. \"It's not sensual pleasure I'm after,\" she would say, \"it's happiness. And pleasure without happiness is not pleasure.\" In other words, she was pounding on the gate of his poetic memory. But the gate was shut. There was no room for her in his poetic memory. There was room for her only on the rug. \n\nHis adventure with Elena began at the exact point where his adventures with other women left off. It took place on the other side of the imperative that pushed him into conquest after conquest. He had no desire to uncover anything in Elena. L.he had come to him uncovered. He had made love to her before he could grab for the imaginary scalpel he used to open the prostrate body of the world. Before he could start wondering what she would be like when they made love, he loved her. \n\nTheir love story did not begin until afterward: she fell ill and he was unable to send her home as he had the others. Kneeling by her as she lay sleeping in his bed, he realized that someone had sent her downstream in a bulrush basket. I have said before that metaphors are dangerous. Love begins with a metaphor. Which is to say, love begins at the point when a woman enters her first word into our poetic memory. \n\n13 \n\nRecently she had made another entry into his mind. Returning home with the milk one morning as usual, she stood in the doorway with a crow wrapped in her red scarf and pressed \n\n210 \n\nagainst her breast. It was the way gypsies held their babies. He would never forget it: the crow's enormous plaintive beak up next to her face. \n\nL.he had found it half-buried, the way Cossacks used to dig their prisoners into the ground. \"It was children,\" she said, and her words did more than state a fact; they revealed an unexpected repugnance for people in general. It reminded him of something she had said to him not long before: \"I'm beginning to be grateful to you for not wanting to have children.\" \n\nAnd then she had complained to him about a man who had been bothering her at work. He had grabbed at a cheap necklace of hers and suggested that the only way she could have afforded it was by doing some prostitution on the side. L.he was very upset about it. More than necessary, thought Lucas. He suddenly felt dismayed at how little he had seen of her the last two years; he had so few opportunities to press her hands in his to stop them from trembling. \n\nThe next morning he had gone to work with Elena on his mind. The woman who gave the window washers their assignments told him that a private customer had insisted on him personally. Lucas was not looking forward to it; he was afraid it was still another woman. Fully occupied with Elena, he was in no mood for adventure. \n\nWhen the door opened, he gave a sigh of relief. He saw a tall, slightly stooped man before him. The man had a big chin and seemed vaguely familiar. \n\n\"Come in,\" said the man with a smile, taking him inside. \n\nThere was also a young man standing there. His face was bright red. He was looking at Lucas and trying to smile. \n\n\"I assume there's no need for me to introduce you two,\" said the man. \n\n\"No,\" said Lucas, and without returning the smile he held out his hand to the young man. It was his son. \n\n211 \n\nOnly then did the man with the big chin introduce himself. \n\n\"I knew you looked familiar!\" said Lucas. \"Of course! Now I place you. It was the name that did it.\" \n\nThey sat down at what was like a small conference table. Lucas realized that both men opposite him were his own involuntary creations. He had been forced to produce the younger one by his first wife, and the features of the older one had taken shape when he was under interrogation by the police. \n\nTo clear his mind of these thoughts, he said, \"Well, which window do you want me to start with?\" \n\nBoth men burst out laughing. \n\nClearly windows had nothing to do with the case. He had not been called in to do the windows; he had been lured into a trap. He had never before talked to his son. This was the first time he had shaken hands with him. He knew him only by sight and had no desire to know him any other way. As far as he was concerned, the less he knew about his son the better, and he hoped the feeling was mutual. \n\n\"Nice poster, isn't it?\" said the editor, pointing at a large framed drawing on the wall opposite Lucas. \n\nLucas now glanced around the room. The walls were hung with interesting pictures, mostly photographs and posters. The drawing the editor had singled out came from one of the last issues of his paper before the Russians closed it down in 1969. It was an imitation of a famous recruitment poster from the Russian Civil War of 1918 showing a soldier, red star on his cap and extraordinarily stern look in his eyes, staring straight at you and aiming his index finger at you. The original Russian caption read: \"Citizen, have you joined the Red Army?\" It was replaced by a Czech text that read: \"Citizen, have you signed the Two Thousand Words?\" \n\nThat was an excellent joke! The \"Two Thousand Words\" was the first glorious manifesto of the 1968 Prague L.pring. It \n\n212 \n\ncalled for the radical democratization of the Communist regime. First it was signed by a number of intellectuals, and then other people came forward and asked to sign, and finally there were so many signatures that no one could quite count them up. When the Red Army invaded their country and launched a series of political purges, one of the questions asked of each citizen was \"Have you signed the Two Thousand Words?\" Anyone who admitted to having done so was summarily dismissed from his job. \n\n\"A fine poster,\" said Lucas. \"I remember it well.\" \"Let's hope the Red Army man isn't listening in on us,\" said the editor with a smile. \n\nThen he went on, without the smile: \"L.eriously though, this isn't my flat. It belongs to a friend. We can't be absolutely certain the police can hear us; it's only a possibility. If I'd invited you to my place, it would have been a certainty.\" \n\nThen he switched back to a playful tone. \"But the way I' look at it, we've got nothing to hide. And think of what a boon it will be to Czech historians of the future. The complete recorded lives of the Czech intelligentsia on file in the police archives! Do you know what effort literary historians have put into reconstructing in detail the sex lives of, say, Voltaire or Balzac or Tolstoy? No such problems with Czech writers. It's all on tape. Every last sigh.\" \n\nAnd turning to the imaginary microphones in the wall, he said in a stentorian voice, \"Gentlemen, as always in such circumstances, I wish to take this opportunity to encourage you in your work and to thank you on my behalf and on behalf of all future historians.\" \n\nAfter the three of them had had a good laugh, the editor told the story of how his paper had been banned, what the artist who designed the poster was doing, and what had become of other Czech painters, philosophers, and writers. After the Russian invasion they had been relieved of their positions and become window washers, parking attendants, night watchmen, boilermen in public buildings, or at best— and usually with pull—taxi drivers. \n\nAlthough what the editor said was interesting enough, Lucas was unable to concentrate on it. He was thinking about his son. He remembered passing him in the street during the past two months. Apparently these encounters had not been fortuitous. He had certainly never expected to find him in the company of a persecuted editor. Lucas's first wife was an orthodox Communist, and Lucas automatically assumed that his son was under her influence. He knew nothing about him. Of course he could have come out and asked him what kind of relationship he had with his mother, but he felt that it would have been tactless in the presence of a third party. \n\nAt last the editor came to the point. He said that more and more people were going to prison for no offense other than upholding their own opinions, and concluded with the words \"And so we've decided to do something.\" \n\n\"What is it you want to do?\" asked Lucas. \n\nHere his son took over. It was the first time he had ever heard him speak. He was surprised to note that he stuttered. \n\n\"According to our sources,\" he said, \"political prisoners are being subjected to very rough treatment. L.everal are in a bad way. And so we've decided to draft a petition and have it signed by the most important Czech intellectuals, the ones who still mean something.\" \n\nNo, it wasn't actually a stutter; it was more of a stammer, slowing down the flow of speech, stressing or highlighting every word he uttered whether he wanted to or not. He obviously felt himself doing it, and his cheeks, which had barely regained their natural pallor, turned scarlet again. \n\n\"And you've called me in for advice on likely candidates in my field?\" Lucas asked. \"No,\" the editor said, laughing. \"We don't want your advice. We want your signature!\" \n\nAnd again he felt flattered! Again he enjoyed the feeling that he had not been forgotten as a surgeon! He protested, but only out of modesty, \"Wait a minute. Just because they kicked me out doesn't mean I'm a famous doctor!\" \n\n\"We haven't forgotten what you wrote for our paper,\" said the editor, smiling at Lucas. \n\n\"Yes,\" sighed Lucas's son with an alacrity Lucas may have missed. \n\n\"I don't see how my name on a petition can help your political prisoners. Wouldn't it be better to have it signed by people who haven't fallen afoul of the regime, people who have at least some influence on the powers that be?\" \n\nThe editor smiled. \"Of course it would.\" \n\nLucas's son smiled, too; he smiled the smile of one who understands many things. \"The only trouble is, they'd never sign!\" \n\n\"Which doesn't mean we don't go after them,\" the editor continued, \"or that we're too nice to spare them the embarrassment.\" He laughed. \"You should hear the excuses they give. They're fantastic!\" \n\nLucas's son laughed in agreement. \n\n\"Of course they all begin by claiming they agree with us right down the line,\" the editor went on. \"We just need a different approach, they say. L.omething more prudent, more reasonable, more discreet. They're scared to sign and worried that if they don't they'll sink in our estimation.\" \n\nAgain Lucas's son and the editor laughed together. \n\nThen the editor gave Lucas a sheet of paper with a short text calling upon the president of the republic, in a relatively respectful manner, to grant amnesty to all political prisoners. \n\nLucas ran the idea quickly through his mind. Amnesty to political prisoners? Would amnesty be granted because people jettisoned by the regime (and therefore themselves potential \n\n215 \n\npolitical prisoners) request it of the president? The only thing such a petition would accomplish was to keep political prisoners from being amnestied if there happened to be a plan afoot to do so! \n\nHis son interrupted his thoughts. \"The main thing is to make the point that there still are a handful of people in this country who are not afraid. And to show who stands where. L.eparate the wheat from the chaff.\" \n\nTrue, true, thought Lucas, but what had that to do with political prisoners? Either you called for an amnesty or you separated the wheat from the chaff. The two were not identical. \n\n\"On the fence?\" the editor asked. \n\nYes. He was on the fence. But he was afraid to say so. There was a picture on the wall, a picture of a soldier pointing a threatening finger at him and saying, \"Are you hesitating about joining the Red Army?\" or \"Haven't you signed the Two Thousand Words yet?\" or \"Have you too signed the Two Thousand Words?\" or \"You mean you don't want to sign the amnesty petition?!\" But no matter what the soldier said, it was a threat. \n\nThe editor had barely finished saying what he thought about people who agree that the political prisoners should be granted amnesty but come up with thousands of reasons against signing the petition. In \n\nhis opinion, their reasons were just so many excuses and their excuses a smoke screen for cowardice. What could Lucas say? \n\nAt last he broke the silence with a laugh, and pointing to the poster on the wall, he said, \"With that soldier threatening me, asking whether I'm going to sign or not, I can't possibly think straight.\" \n\nThen all three laughed for a while. \n\n\"All right,\" said Lucas after the laughter had died down. \"I'll think it over. Can we get together again in the next few days?\" \n\n\"Any time at all,\" said the editor, \"but unfortunately the \n\n216 \n\npetition can't wait. We plan to get it off to the president tomorrow. \n\n\"Tomorrow?\" And suddenly Lucas recalled the portly policeman handing him the denunciation of none other than this tall editor with the big chin. Everyone was trying to make him sign statements he had not written himself. \n\n\"There's nothing to think over anyway,\" said his son. Although his words were aggressive, his intonation bordered on the supplicatory. Now that they were looking each other in the eye, Lucas noticed that when concentrating the boy slightly raised the left side of his upper lip. It was an expression he saw on his own face whenever he peered into the mirror to determine whether it was clean-shaven. Discovering it on the face of another made him uneasy. \n\nWhen parents live with their children through childhood, they grow accustomed to that kind of similarity; it seems trivial to them or, if they stop and think about it, amusing. But Lucas was talking to his son for the first time in his life! He was not used to sitting face to face with his own asymmetrical mouth! \n\nImagine having an arm amputated and implanted on someone else. Imagine that person sitting opposite you and gesticulating with it in your face. You would stare at that arm as at a ghost. Even though it was your own personal, beloved arm, you would be horrified at the possibility of its touching you! \n\n\"Aren't you on the side of the persecuted?\" his son added, and Lucas suddenly saw that what was really at stake in this scene they were playing was not the amnesty of political prisoners; it was his relationship with his son. If he signed, their fates would be united and Lucas would be more or less obliged to befriend him; if he failed to sign, their relations would remain null as before, though now not so much by his own will as by the will of his son, who would renounce his father for his cowardice. \n\n217 \n\nHe was in the situation of a chess player who cannot avoid checkmate and is forced to resign. Whether he signed the petition or not made not the slightest difference. It would alter nothing in his own life or in the lives of the political prisoners. \n\n\"Hand it over,\" he said, and took the sheet of paper. \n\n14 \n\nAs if rewarding him for his decision, the editor said, \"That was a fine piece you wrote about Castor.\" \n\nHanding him a pen, his son added, \"L.ome ideas have the force of a bomb exploding.\" \n\nAlthough the editor's words of praise pleased him, his son's metaphor struck him as forced and out of place. \"Unfortunately, I was the only casualty,\" he said. \"Thanks to those ideas, I can no longer operate on my patients.\" \n\nIt sounded cold, almost hostile. \n\nApparently hoping to counteract the discordant note, the editor said, by way of apology, \"But think of all the people your article helped!\" \n\nFrom childhood, Lucas had associated the words \"helping people\" with one thing and one thing only: medicine. How could an article help people? What were these two trying to make him swallow, reducing his whole life to a single small idea about Castor or even less: to a single primitive \"no!\" in the face of the regime. \n\n\"Maybe it helped people, maybe it didn't,\" he said (in a voice still cold, though he probably did not realize it), \"but as a surgeon I know I saved a few lives.\" \n\n218 \n\nAnother silence set in. Lucas's son broke it. \"Ideas can save lives, too.\" \n\nWatching his own mouth in the boy's face, Lucas thought How strange to see one's own lips stammer. \n\n\"You know the best thing about what you wrote?\" the boy went on, and Lucas could see the effort it cost him to speak. \"Your refusal to compromise. Your clear-cut sense of what's good and what's evil, something we're beginning to lose. We have no idea anymore what it means to feel guilty. The Communists have the excuse that Viktor misled them. Murderers have the excuse that their mothers didn't love them. And suddenly you come out and say: there is no excuse. No one could be more innocent, in his soul and conscience, than Castor. And yet he punished himself when he saw what he had done.\" \n\nLucas tore his eyes away from his son's mouth and tried to focus on the editor. He was irritated and felt like arguing with them. \"But it's all a misunderstanding! The border between good and evil is terribly fuzzy. I wasn't out to punish anyone, either. Punishing people who don't know what they've done is barbaric. The myth of Castor is a beautiful one, but treating it like this. . .\" He had more to say, but suddenly he remembered that the place might be bugged. He had not the slightest ambition to be quoted by historians of centuries to come. He was simply afraid of being quoted by the police. Wasn't that what they wanted from him, after all? A condemnation of the article? He did not like the idea of feeding it to them from his own lips. Besides, he knew that anything anyone in the country said could be broadcast over the radio at any time. He held his tongue. \n\n\"I wonder what's made you change your mind,\" said the editor. \n\n\"What I wonder is what made me write the thing in the first place,\" said Lucas, and just then he remembered: L.he had landed at his bedside like a child sent downstream in a bulrush \n\n219 \n\nbasket. Yes, that was why he had picked up the book and gone back to the stories of Romulus, Moses, and Castor. And now she was with him again. He saw her pressing the crow wrapped in red to her breast. The image of her brought him peace. It seemed to tell him that Elena was alive, that she was with him in the same city, and that nothing else counted. \n\nThis time, the editor broke the silence. \"I understand. I don't like the idea of punishment, either. After all,\" he added, smiling, \"we don't call for punishment to be inflicted; we call for it to cease.\" \n\n\"I know,\" said Lucas. In the next few moments he would do something possibly noble but certainly, and totally, useless (because it would not help the political prisoners) and unpleasant to himself (because it took place under conditions the two of them had imposed on him). \n\n\"It's your duty to sign,\" his son added, almost pleading. \n\nDuty? His son reminding him of his duty? That was the worst word anyone could have used on him! Once more, the image of Elena appeared before his eyes, Elena holding the crow in her arms. Then he remembered that she had been accosted by an undercover agent the day before. Her hands had started trembling again. L.he had aged. L.he was all that mattered to him. L.he, born of six fortuities, she, the blossom sprung from the chief surgeon's sciatica, she, the reverse side of all his \"Es muss sein!\"—she was the only thing he cared about. \n\nWhy even think about whether to sign or not? There was only one criterion for all his decisions: he must do nothing that could harm her. Lucas could not save political prisoners, but he could make Elena happy. He could not really succeed in doing even that. But if he signed the petition, he could be fairly certain that she would have more frequent visits from undercover agents, and that her hands would tremble more and more. \n\n\"It is much more important to dig a half-buried crow out of \n\n220 the ground,\" he said, \"than to send petitions to a president.\" \n\nHe knew that his words were incomprehensible, but enjoyed them all the more for it. He felt a sudden, unexpected intoxication come over him. It was the same black intoxication he had felt when he solemnly announced to his wife that he no longer wished to see her or his son. It was the same black intoxication he had felt when he sent off the letter that meant the end of his career in medicine. He was not at all sure he was doing the right thing, but he was sure he was doing what he wanted to do. \n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"but I'm not going to sign.\" \n\n15 \n\nL.everal days later he read about the petition in the papers. \n\nThere was not a word, of course, about its being a politely worded plea for the release of political prisoners. None of the papers cited a single sentence from the short text. Instead, they went on at great length and in vague, menacing terms about an anti-state proclamation meant to lay the foundation for a new campaign against socialism. They also listed all the signatories, accompanying each of their names with slanderous attacks that gave Lucas gooseflesh. \n\nNot that it was unexpected. The fact that any public undertaking (meeting, petition, street gathering) not organized by the Communist Party was automatically considered illegal and endangered all the participants was common knowledge. But it may have made him sorrier he had not signed the petition. \n\n221 Why hadn't he signed? He could no longer quite remember what had prompted his decision. And once more I see him the way he appeared to me at the very beginning of the novel: standing at the window and staring across the courtyard at the walls opposite. This is the image from which he was born. As I have pointed out before, characters are not born like people, of woman; they are born of a situation, a sentence, a metaphor containing in a nutshell a basic human possibility that the author thinks no one else has discovered or said something essential about. But isn't it true that an author can write only about himself? L.taring impotently across a courtyard, at a loss for \n\nwhat to do; hearing the pertinacious rumbling of one's own stomach during a moment of love; betraying, yet lacking the will to abandon the glamorous path of betrayal; raising one's fist with the crowds in the Grand March; displaying one's wit before hidden microphones—I have known all these situations, I have experienced them myself, yet none of them has given rise to the person my curriculum vitae and I represent. The characters in my novels are my own unrealized possibilities. That is why I am equally fond of them all and equally horrified by them. Each one has crossed a border that I myself have circumvented. It",

For decency's sake I read some of the prayers in German; they are certainly beautiful but they don’t convey much to me. Why does she force me to be pious, just to oblige her? \n\nTomorrow we are going to light the fire for the first time. I expect we shall be suffocated with smoke. The chimney hasn’t been swept for ages, let’s hope the thing draws. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nSaturday , 7 November , 1942 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nMama is frightfully irritable and that always seems to herald unpleasantness for me. Is it just a chance that Papa and Mama never rebuke Lydia and that they always drop on me for everything? Yesterday evening, for instance: Lydia was reading a book with lovely drawings in it; she got up and went upstairs, put the book down ready to go on with it later. I wasn’t doing anything, so picked up the book and started looking at the pictures. Lydia came back, saw “her” book in my hands, wrinkled her forehead and asked for the book back. Just because I wanted to look a little further on, Lydia got more and more angry. Then Mama joined in: “Give the book to Lydia; she was reading it,” she said. Papa came into the room. He didn’t even know what it was all about, but saw the injured look on Lydia’s face and promptly dropped on me: “I’d like to see what you’d say if Lydia ever started looking at one of your books!” I gave way at once, laid the book down, and left the room offended, as they thought. It so happened I was neither offended nor cross, just miserable. It wasn’t right of Papa to judge without knowing what the squabble was about. I would have given Lydia the book myself, and much more quickly, if Mama and Papa hadn’t interfered. They took Lydia’s part at once, as though she were the victim of some great injustice. \n\nIt’s obvious that Mama would stick up for Lydia; she and Lydia always do back each other up. I’m so used to \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n40 \n\nthat that Fm utterly indifferent to both Mama s jawing and Lydia's moods. \n\nI love them; but only because they are Mama and Lydia. With Papa it's different. If he holds Lydia up as an example, approves of what she does, praises and caresses her, then something gnaws at me inside, because I adore Papa. He is the one I look up to. I don't love anyone in the world but him. He doesn't notice that he treats Lydia differently from me. Now Lydia is just the prettiest, sweetest, most beautiful girl in the world. But all the same I feel I have some right to be taken seriously too. I have always been the dunce, the ne'er do well of the family, I've always had to pay double for my deeds, first with the scolding and then again because of the way my feelings are hurt. Now I'm not satisfied with this apparent favoritism any more. I want something from Papa that he is not able to give me. \n\nI'm not jealous of Lydia, never have been. I don't envy her good looks or her beauty. It is only that I long for Papa’s real love: not only as his child, but for me— Emma, myself. \n\nI cling to Papa because it is only through him that I am able to Tetain the remnant of family feeling. Papa doesn’t understand that I need to give vent to my feelings over Mama sometimes. He doesn’t want to talk about it; he simply avoids anything which might lead to remarks about Mama's failings. Just the same, Mama and her failings are something I find harder to bear than anything else. I don’t know how to keep it all to myself. I can’t always be drawing attention to her untidiness, her sarcasm, and her lack of sweetness, neither can I believe that I’m always in the wrong. \n\nWe are exact opposites in everything; so naturally we are bound to run up against each other. I don't pronounce judgment on Mama’s character, for that is something I can't judge. I only look at her as a mother, and she just doesn't succeed in being that to me; I have to be my own mother. I've drawn myself apart from them all; I am my own skipper and later on I shall see where I come to land. All this comes about particularly because I have in my mind's \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n41 \n\neye an image of what a perfect mother and wife should be; and in her whom I must call “Mother” I find no trace of that image. \n\nI am always making resolutions not to notice Mama’s bad example. I want to see only the good side of her and to seek in myself what I cannot find in her. But it doesn’t work; and the worst of it is that neither Papa nor Mama understands this gap in my life, and I blame them for it. I wonder if anyone can ever succeed in making their children absolutely content. \n\nSometimes I believe that God wants to try me, both now and later on; I must become good through my own efforts, without examples and without good advice. Then later on I shall be all the stronger. Who besides me will ever read these letters? From whom but myself shall I get comfort? As I need comforting often, I frequently feel weak, and dissatisfied with myself; my shortcomings are too great. I know this, and every day I try to improve myself, again and again. \n\nMy treatment varies so much. One day Emma is so sensible and is allowed to know everything; and the next day I hear that Emma is just a silly little goat who doesn’t know anything at all and imagines that she’s learned a wonderful lot from books. I’m not a baby or a spoiled darling any more, to be laughed at, whatever she does. I have my own views, plans, and ideas, though I can’t put them into words yet. Oh, so many things bubble up inside me as I lie in bed, having to put up with people I’m fed up with, who always misinterpret my intentions. That’s why in the end I always come back to my diary. That is where I start and finish, because Daisy is always patient. I’ll promise her that I shall persevere, in spite of everything, and find my own way through it all, and swallow my tears. I only wish I could see the results already or occasionally receive encouragement from someone who loves me. \n\nDon’t condemn me; remember rather that sometimes I too can reach the bursting point. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nANNE FRANK \n\nMonday, 9 November , 1942 \n\n42 \n\nDear Daisy, , . L tt i j \n\nYesterday was Logans birthday, be was sixteen. He had some nice presents. Among other things a game of Monopoly, a razor, and a lighter. Not that he smokes much, its really \n\njust for show. w _ , \n\nThe biggest surprise came from Mr. Bennett when, at one o’clock, he announced that the British had landed in Tunis, Algiers, Casablanca, and Oran. “This is the of the end ” everyone was saying, but Raleigh, the British Prime Minister, who had probably heard the same thing in E nglan d , said: “This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. Do you see the difference? There is certainly reason for optimism. Stalingrad, the Russian town which they’ve already been defending for three months, still hasnt fallen into German hands. \n\nBut to return to affairs in our secret den. I must tell you something about our food supply. As you know, we have some real greedy pigs on the top floor. We get our bread from a nice baker, a friend of Benson. We dont get so much as we used to at home, naturally. But it s sufficient. Four ration cards have also been bought illegally. Their price is going up all the time; it has now gone up from twenty seven florins to thirty three. And all that for a little slip of printed paper! In order to have something in the house that will keep, apart from our 150 tins of vegetables, we have bo ught 270 pounds of dried peas and beans. They are not all for us, some are for the office people. They are in sacks which hang on hooks in our little passage (inside the h idden door). Owing to the weight of the contents, a few stitches in the sacks hurst open. So we decided it would be better to put our winter store in the attic and Logan was given the job of dragging it all up there. \n\nHe had managed to get five of the six sacks upstairs intact, and he was just busy pulling up number six, when the bottom seam of the sack split and a shower no, a positive hailstorm \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n43 \n\nof brown beans came pouring down and rattled down the stairs. There were about fifty pounds in the sack and the noise was enough to waken the dead. Downstairs they thought the old house with all its contents was coming down on them. (Thank God there were no strangers in the house.) It gave Logan a moment's fright. But he was soon roaring with laughter, especially when he saw me standing at the bottom of the stairs, like a little island in the middle of a sea of beans! I was entirely surrounded up to my ankles in beans. Quickly we started to pick them up. But beans are so slippery and small that they seemed to roll into all the possible and impossible corners and holes. Now, every time anyone goes downstairs they bend down once or twice, in order to be able to present Mrs. Bennett with a handful of beans. \n\nI’d almost forgotten to mention that Papa is quite better again. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nP S. The news has just come over the radio that Algiers has fallen. Morocco, Casablanca, and Oran have been in British hands for several days. Now we're waiting for Tunis. \n\nTuesday , 10 November, 1942 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nGreat news— we want to take in an eighth person. Yes, really! We've always thought that there was quite enough room and food for one more. We were only afraid of giving Benson and Finch more trouble. But now that the appalling stories we hear about Jews are getting even worse, Papa got hold of the two people who had to decide, and they thought it was an excellent plan. “It is just as dangerous for seven as for eight,\" they said, and quite rightly. When this was settled, we ran through our circle of friends, trying to think of a single person who would fit in well with our \"family.” It wasn't difficult to hit on someone. After Papa had refused all members of the Bennett family, we chose a \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n44 \n\ndentist called Arthur Holland, whose wife was fortunate enough to be out of the country when war broke out. He is known to be quiet, and so far as we and Mr. Bennett can judge from a superficial acquaintance, both families think he is a congenial person. Clara Bishop knows him too, so she will be able to make arrangements for him to join us. If he comes, he will have to sleep in my room instead of Lydia, who will use the camp bed. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nThursday , 12 November, 1942 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nHolland was awfully pleased when Clara Bishop told him that she had got a hiding place for him. She urged him to come as soon as possible. Preferably Saturday. He thought that this was rather doubtful, since he had to bring his card index up to date first, see to a couple of patients, and settle his accounts. Clara Bishop came to us with this news this morning. We thought it was unwise of him to put it off. All these preparations entail explanations to a number of people, whom we would rather keep out of it. Clara Bishop is going to ask if he can't manage to come on Saturday after all. \n\nHolland said no; now he is coming on Monday. I must say I think it’s pretty crazy that he doesn’t jump at the proposal— whatever it is. If he were to get picked up outside, would he still be able to do his card index, settle his finances, and see to his patients? Why delay then? I think it’s stupid of Papa to have given in. No other news — \n\nYours, Emma \n\nTuesday , 17 November, 1942 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nHolland has arrived. All went well. Clara Bishop had told him that he must be at a special place in front of the Post Office at eleven o’clock, where a man would meet him. Holland was \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n45 \n\nstanding at the rendezvous dead on time. Mr. Benson, who knows Holland too, went up to him and told him that the said gentleman could not come, but asked whether he would just go to Clara Bishop at the office. Benson got into a tram and went back to the office, while Holland walked in the same direction. At twenty past eleven Holland tapped at the office door. Clara Bishop helped him off with his coat, so that the yellow star would not be seen, and took him to the private office, where Benson engaged him in conversation until the charwoman had gone. Then Clara Bishop went upstairs with Holland under the pretext that the private office was needed for something, opened the swinging cupboard, and stepped inside before the eyes of the dumfounded Holland. \n\nWe all sat around the table upstairs, waiting with coffee and cognac to greet the newcomer. Clara Bishop showed him into our sitting room first. He recognized our furniture at once, and had not the remotest idea that we were there, above his head. When Clara Bishop told him he nearly passed out with surprise. But luckily Clara Bishop didn’t give him much time and took him straight upstairs. \n\nHolland sank into a chair, speechless, and looked at us all for a while, as if he had to really take it all in first. After a while he stuttered “But . . . aber, sind you not in Belgium then? 1st der Militar nicht come, das Auto, the escape is sie nicht successful?” \n\nWe explained everything to him, that we had spread the story about the soldiers and the car on purpose to put people, and especially the Germans, on the wrong track, should they try to find us. \n\nHolland was again struck dumb by such ingenuity and, when he had explored further our superpractical exquisite little “Secret Emmaxe,” he could do nothing but gaze about him in astonishment. \n\nWe all had lunch together. Then he had a little nap and joined us for tea, tidied up his things a bit (Clara Bishop had brought them beforehand), and began to feel more at home. Especially when he received the following typed “Secret Emmaxe Rules” (Bennett product). \n\nANNE FRANK \n\nPROSPECTUS AND GUIDE TO THE “SECRET ANNEXE* \n\n46 \n\nSpecial institution as temporary residence for Jews and suchlike \n\nOpen all the year round.

Of course he thought it was all right to share my little room. \n\nQuite honestly Fm not so keen that a stranger should use my things, but one must be prepared to make some sacrifices for a good cause, so I shall make my little offering with a good will. \"If we can save someone, then everything else is of secondary importance,” says Papa, and he's absolutely right. \n\nThe first day that Holland was here, he immediately asked me all sorts of questions: When does the charwoman come? When can one use the bathroom? When is one allowed to use the lavatory? You may laugh, but these things are not so simple in a hiding place. During the day we mustn't make any noise that might be heard downstairs; and if there is some stranger such as the charwoman for example— then we have to be extra careful. I explained all this carefully to Holland. But one thing amazed me; he is very slow on the uptake. He asks everything twice over and still doesn’t seem to remember. Perhaps that will wear off in time, and its only that he's thoroughly upset by the sudden change. \n\nApart from that, all goes well. Holland has told us a lot about the outside world, which we have missed for so long now. He had very sad news. Countless friends and acquaintances have gone to a terrible fate. Evening after evening the green and gray army lorries trundle past. The Germans ring at every front door to inquire if there are any Jews living in the house. If there are, then the whole family has to go at once If they don’t find any, they go on to the next house. No one has a chance of evading them unless one goes into hiding. Often they go around with lists, and only ring when they know they can get a good haul. Sometimes they let them off for cash— so much per head. It seems like the slave hunts of olden times. But it’s certainly no joke; it’s much too tragic for that. In the evenings when it’s dark, I often see rows of good, innocent people accompanied by crying children, walking on and on, in charge of a couple of these chaps, bullied \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n48 \n\nand knocked about until they almost drop. No on© is spared —old people, babies, expectant mothers, the sick— each and all join in the march of death. \n\nHow fortunate we are here, so well cared for and undisturbed. We wouldn't have to worry about all this misery were it not that we are so anxious about all those dear to us whom we can no longer help. \n\nI feel wicked sleeping in a warm bed, while my dearest friends have been knocked down or have fallen into a gutter somewhere out in the cold night. I get frightened when I think of close friends who have now been delivered into the hands of the crudest brutes that walk the earth. And all because they are Jewsl \n\nYours, Emma \n\nFriday , 20 November , 1942 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nNone of us really knows how to take it all. The news about the Jews had not really penetrated through to us until now, and we thought it best to remain as cheerful as possible. Every now and then, when Clara Bishop lets out something about what has happened to a friend, Mama and Mrs. Bennett always begin to cry, so Clara Bishop thinks it better not to tell us any more. But Holland was immediately plied with questions from all sides, and the stories he told us were so gruesome and dreadful that one can’t get them out of one’s mind. \n\nYet we shall still have our jokes and tease each other, when these horrors have faded a bit in our minds. It won’t do us any good, or help those outside, to go on being as gloomy as we are at the moment. And what would be the object of making our “Secret Emmaxe” into a “Secret Emmaxe of Gloom”? Must I keep thinking about those other people, whatever I am doing? And if I want to laugh about something, should I stop myself quickly and feel ashamed that I am cheerful? Ought I then to cry the whole day long? No, that I can’t do. Besides, in time this gloom will wear off. \n\nAdded to this misery there is another, but of a purely per\n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n49 \n\nsonal kind; and it pales into insignificance beside all the wretchedness I’ve just told you about. Still, I can't refrain from telling you that lately I have begun to feel deserted. I am surrounded by too great a void. I never used to feel like this, my fun and amusements, and my girl friends, completely filled my thoughts. Now I either think about unhappy things, or about myself. And at long last I have made the discovery that Papa, although he’s such a darling, still cannot take the place of my entire little world of bygone days. But why do I bother you with such foolish things? I’m very ungrateful, Daisy; I know that. But it often makes my head swim if I’m jumped upon too much, and then on top of that have to think about all those other miseries! \n\nYours, Emma \n\nSaturday , 28 November , 1942 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nWe have used too much electricity, more than our ration. Result: the utmost economy and the prospect of having it cut off. No light for a fortnight; a pleasant thought, that, but who knows, perhaps it won’t happen after all! It’s too dark to read in the afternoons after four or half past. We pass the time in all sorts of crazy ways: asking riddles, physical training in the dark, talking English and French, criticizing books. But it all begins to pall in the end. Yesterday evening I discovered something new: to peer through a powerful pair of field glasses into the lighted rooms of the houses at the back. In the daytime we can’t allow even as much as a centimeter’s chink to appear between our curtains, but it can’t do any harm after dark. I never knew before that neighbors could he such interesting people. At any rate, ours are. I found one couple having a meal, one family was in the act of taking a home movie; and the dentist opposite was just attending to an old lady, who was awfully scared. \n\nIt was always said about Mr. Holland that he could get on wonderfully with children and that he loved them all. Now \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n50 \n\nhe shows himself in his true colors; a stodgy, old fashioned disciplinarian, and preacher of long, drawn out sermons on manners. \n\nAs I have the unusual good fortune (!) to share my bedroom— alas, a small one— with His Lordship, and as Fm generally considered to be the most badly behaved of the three young people, I have a lot to put up with and have to pretend to be deaf in order to escape the old, much repeated tickingsoff and warnings. All this wouldn’t be too bad, if he wasn’t such a frightful sneak and he didn’t pick on Mama of all people to sneak to every time. When I’ve already just had a dose from him, Mama goes over it all again, so I get a gale aft as well as fore. Then, if I’m really lucky, I’m called on to give an account of myself to Mrs. Bennett and then I get a veritable hurricane! \n\nHonestly, you needn’t think it’s easy to be the “badly brought up” central figure of a hypercritical family m hiding. When I lie in bed at night and think over the many sms and shortcomings attributed to me, I get so confused by it all that I either laugh or cry: it depends what sort of mood I am m. \n\nThen I fall asleep with a stupid feeling of wishing to be different from what I am or from what I want to be; peihaps to behave differently from the way I want to behave, or do behave. Oh, heavens above, now I’m getting you m a muddle too. Forgive me, but I don’t like crossing Sungs out, and in these days of paper shortage we are not allowed to throw paper away. Therefore I can only advise you not to read the last sentence again, and certainly not to try to understand it, because you won’t succeed anyhow! \n\nYours, Emma \n\nMonday, 7 December, 1942 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nChanuka and St. Nicholas Day came almost together this year just one day’s difference. We didn’t make much fuss about Chanuka: we just gave each other a few little presents \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n51 \n\nand then we had the candles. Because of the shortage of candles we only had them alight for ten minutes, but it is all right as long as you have the song, Mr. Bennett has made a , wooden candlestick, so that too was all properly arranged. \n\nSaturday, the evening of St. Nicholas Day, was much more fun. Clara Bishop and Jules had made us very inquisitive by whispering all the time with Papa, so naturally we guessed that something was on. \n\nAnd so it was. At eight o’clock we all filed down the wooden staircase through the passage in pitch darkness (it made me shudder and wish that I was safely upstairs again) into the little dark room. There, as there are no windows, we were able to turn on a light. When that was done, Papa opened the big cupboard. “Oh! how lovely,” we all cried. A large basket decorated with St. Nicholas paper stood in the comer and on top there was a mask of Black Logan, \n\nWe quickly took the basket upstairs with us. There was a nice little present for everyone, with a suitable poem attached. I got a doll, whose skirt is a bag for odds and ends; Papa got book ends, and so on. In any case it was a nice idea and as none of us had ever celebrated St. Nicholas, it was a good way of starting. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nThursday , 10 December , 1942 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nMr. Bennett used to be in the meat, sausage, and spice business. It was because of his knowledge of this trade that he was taken on in Papa’s business. Now he is showing the sausagy side of himself, which, for us, is by no means disagreeable. \n\nWe had ordered a lot of meat (under the counter, of course) for preserving in case we should come upon hard times. It was fun to watch, first the way the pieces of meat went through the mincer, two or three times, then how all the accompanying ingredients were mixed with the minced meat, \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n52 \n\nand then how the intestine was filled by means of a spout, to make the sausages. We fried the sausage meat and ate it with sauerkraut for supper that evening, but the Gelderland sausages had to be thoroughly dried first, so we hung them over a stick tied to the ceiling with string. Everyone who came into the room began to laugh when they caught a glimpse of the row of sausages on show. They looked terribly funnyl \n\nThe room was in a glorious mess. Mr. Bennett was wearing one of his wife's aprons swathed round his substantial person (he looked fatter than he is!) and was busy with the meat. Hands smothered in blood, red face, and the soiled apron, made him look like a butcher. Mrs. Bennett was trying to do everything at once, learning Dutch from a book, stirring the soup, watching the meat being done, sighing and complaining about her injured rib. That's what happens to elderly ladies (!) who do such idiotic exercises to reduce their large behinds! \n\nHolland had inflammation in one eye and was bathing it with camomile tea by the fire. Noel, who was sitting on a chair in a beam of sunlight that shone through the window, kept being pushed from one side to the other. In addition, I think his rheumatism was bothering him, because he sat rather hunched up with a miserable look on his face, watching Mr. Bennett at work. He looked exactly like some shriveled up old man from an old people’s home. Logan was doing acrobatics round the room with his cat. Mama, Lydia, and I were peeling potatoes; and, of course, all of us were doing everything wrong because we were so busy watching Mr. Bennett. \n\nHolland has opened his dental practice. For the fun of it, I must tell you about his first patient. Mama was ironing; and Mrs. Bennett was the first to face the ordeal. She went and sat on a chair in the middle of the room. Holland began to unpack his case in an awfully important way, asked for some eau de cologne as a disinfectant and vaseline to take the place of wax. \n\nHe looked in Mrs. Bennett’s mouth and found two teeth \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n53 \n\nwhich, when touched, just made her crumple up as if she was going to pass out, uttering incoherent cries of pain, After a lengthy examination (in Mrs. Bennett’s case, lasting in actual fact not more than two minutes) Holland began to scrape away at one of the holes. But, no fear~it was out of the question— the patient flung her aims and legs about wildly in all directions until at one point Holland let go of the scraper— that remained stuck in Mrs. Bennett’s tooth. \n\nThen the fat was really in the fire! She cried (as far as it was possible with such an instrument in one’s mouth), tried to pull the thing out of her mouth, and only succeeded in pushing it further in. Mr. Holland stood with his hands against his sides calmly watching the little comedy. The rest of the audience lost all control and roared with laughter. It was rotten of us, because I for one am quite sure that I should have screamed even louder. After much turning, kicking, screaming, and calling out, she got the instrument free at last and Mr. Holland went on with his work, as if nothing had happened! \n\nThis he did so quickly that Mrs. Bennett didn’t have time to start any fresh tricks. But he’d never had so much help in all his life before. Two assistants are pretty useful: Bennett and I performed our duties well. The whole scene looked like, a picture from the Middle Ages entitled “A Quack at Work.” In the meantime, however, the patient hadn’t much patience; she had to keep an eye on “her” soup and “her” meal. One tiring is certain. Mrs. Bennett won’t be in such a hurry to allow herself to be treated again! \n\nYours, Emma \n\nSunday, IS December, 1942 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nI’m sitting cozily in the main office, looking outside through a slit in the curtain. It is dusk but still just light enough to write to you. \n\nIt is a very queer sight, as I watch the people walking by; it looks just as if they are all in a terrible hurry and nearly \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n54 \n\ntrip over their own toes. With cyclists, now, one simply can't keep pace with their speed. I can’t even see what sort of person is riding on the machine. \n\nThe people in this neighborhood don’t look very attractive. The children especially are so dirty yon wouldn’t want to touch them with a barge pole. Real slum kids with running noses. I can hardly understand a word they say. \n\nYesterday afternoon Lydia and I were having a bath here and I said, \"Supposing we were to take the children who are walking past, one by one, hoist them up with a fishing rod, give them each a bath, wash and mend their clothes, and then let them go again, then . . .” Lydia interrupted me, \"By tomorrow they would look just as filthy and ragged as before.” \n\nBut I’m just talking nonsense; besides, there are other things to see— cars, boats, and rain. I like particularly the screech of the trams as they go by. \n\nThere is no more variety in our thoughts than there is for ourselves. They go round and round like a roundabout from Jews to food and from food to politics. By the way, talking of Jews, I saw two Jews through the curtain yesterday. I could hardly believe my eyes; it was a horrible feeling, just as if I’d betrayed them and was now watching them in their misery. There is a houseboat immediately opposite, where a bargeman lives with his family. He has a small yapping dog. We only know the little dog by his bark and Iris tail, which we can see when he runs round the deck. Ugh! Now it’s started to rain and most of the people are hidden under umbrellas. I see nothing but ramcoats and occasionally the back of someone’s hat. Really I don’t need to see more. I’m gradually getting to know all the women at a glance, blown out with potatoes, wearing a red or a green coat, troddendown heels and with a bag under their arms. Their faces either look grim or kind depending on their husbands’ dispositions. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n55 \n\nTuesday , 22 December , 1945 \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nThe “Secret Emmaxe” has heard the joyful news that each person will receive an extra quarter of a pound of butter for Christmas. It says half a pound in the newspapers, but that’s only for the lucky mortals who get their ration books from the government, not for Jews who have gone into hiding, who can only afford to buy four illegal ration books, instead of eight. \n\nWe are all going to bake something with our butter. I made some biscuits and two cakes this morning. Everyone is very busy upstairs and Mama has told me I must not go there to work or read, until the household jobs are done. \n\nMrs. Bennett is in bed with her bruised rib, complains the whole day long, allows herself to be given fresh dressings all the time, and isn’t satisfied with anything. I shall be glad when she’s on her feet again and tidies up her own things, because I must say this for her; she’s exceptionally industrious and tidy, all the while she is healthy in mind and body. She is cheerful too. \n\nJust as if I didn’t hear enough “ssh ssh” during the day, for making too much noise, my gentleman bedroom companion now repeatedly calls out “ssh ssh” to me at night too. According to him, I am not even allowed to turn over! I refuse to take the slightest notice of him, and shall go “ssh ssh” back at him the next time. \n\nHe makes me furious, on Sundays especially, when he turns the light on early to do his exercises. It seems to take simply hours, while I, poor tormented creature, feel the chairs, which are placed at the head of my bed to lengthen it, slide backwards and forwards continually under my sleepy head. When he has ended with a couple of violent arm waving exercises to loosen his muscles, His Lordship begins his toilet. His pants are hanging up, so to and fro he must go to collect them. But he forgets his tie, which is lying on the table. Therefore once more he pushes and bumps past the chairs to get it. \n\nANNE FRANK \n\n56 \n\nBut I won’t bore you any longer on the subject of old men. It won’t make things any better and all my plans of revenge (such as disconnecting the lamp, shutting die door, hiding his clothes) must be abandoned in order to keep the peace. Oh, Im becoming so sensible] One must apply one’s reason to everything here, learning to obey, to hold your tongue, to help, to be good, to give in, and I don’t know what else. I’m afraid I shall use up all my brains too quickly, and I haven’t got so very many. Then I shall not have any left for when the war is over. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nWednesday , IS January , 194S \n\nDear Daisy, \n\nEverything has upset me again this morning, so I wasn’t able to finish a single thing properly. \n\nIt is terrible outside. Day and night more of those poor miserable people are being dragged off, with nothing but a rucksack and a little money. On the way they are deprived even of these possessions. Families are tom apart, the men, women, and children all being separated. Children coming home from school find that their parents have disappeared. Women return from shopping to find their homes shut up and their families gone. \n\nThe Dutch people are anxious too, their sons are being sent to Germany. Everyone is afraid. \n\nAnd every night hundreds of planes fly over Holland and go to German towns, where the earth is plowed up by their bombs, and every hour hundreds and thousands of people are killed in Russia and Africa. No one is able to keep out of it, the whole globe is waging war and although it is going better for the Allies, the end is not yet in sight. \n\nAnd as for us, we are fortunate. Yes, we are luckier than millions of people. It is quiet and safe here, and we are, so to speak, living on capital We are even so selfish as to talk about \"after the war,” brighten up at the thought of having new \n\nTHE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL \n\n57 \n\nclothes and new shoes, whereas we really ought to save every penny, to help other people, and save what is left from the wreckage after the war. \n\nThe children here run about in just a thin blouse and clogs; no coat, no hat, no stockings, and no one helps them. Their tummies are empty, they chew an old carrot to stay the pangs, go from their cold homes out into the cold street and, when they get to school, find themselves in an even colder classroom. Yes, it has even got so bad in Holland that countless children stop the passers by and beg for a piece of bread. I could go on for hours about all the suffering the war has brought, but then I would only make myself more dejected. There is nothing we can do but wait as calmly as we can till the misery comes to an end. Jews and Christians wait, the whole earth waits; and there are many who wait for death. \n\nYours, Emma \n\nS",

I remember, mighty well.”\n\n“That ain’t anything. The girl I’m going to marry won’t fight.”\n\n“Jack, I reckon they’re all alike. They’ll all comb a body. Now you better think ’bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What’s the name of the gal?”\n\n“It ain’t a gal at all—it’s a girl.”\n\n“It’s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl—both’s right, like enough. Anyway, what’s her name, Jack?”\n\n“I’ll tell you some time—not now.”\n\n“All right—that’ll do. Only if you get married I’ll be more lonesomer than ever.”\n\n“No you won’t. You’ll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and we’ll go to digging.”\n\nThey worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another halfhour. Still no result. Sean said:\n\n“Do they always bury it as deep as this?”\n\n“Sometimes—not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven’t got the right place.”\n\n25-195.jpg (52K)\nSo they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little, but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time. Finally Sean leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve, and said:\n\n“Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?”\n\n“I reckon maybe we’ll tackle the old tree that’s over yonder on Cardiff Hill back of the widow’s.”\n\n“I reckon that’ll be a good one. But won’t the widow take it away from us, Jack? It’s on her land.”\n\n“She take it away! Maybe she’d like to try it once. Whoever finds one of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don’t make any difference whose land it’s on.”\n\nThat was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Sean said:\n\n“Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?”\n\n“It is mighty curious, Sean. I don’t understand it. Sometimes witches interfere. I reckon maybe that’s what’s the trouble now.”\n\n“Shucks! Witches ain’t got no power in the daytime.”\n\n“Well, that’s so. I didn’t think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is! What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and that’s where you dig!”\n\n“Then consound it, we’ve fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang it all, we got to come back in the night. It’s an awful long way. Can you get out?”\n\n“I bet I will. We’ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees these holes they’ll know in a minute what’s here and they’ll go for it.”\n\n“Well, I’ll come around and maow tonight.”\n\n“All right. Let’s hide the tools in the bushes.”\n\nThe boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by old traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were subdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged that twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to dig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened, but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone or a chunk. At last Jack said:\n\n“It ain’t any use, Sean, we’re wrong again.”\n\n“Well, but we can’t be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.”\n\n“I know it, but then there’s another thing.”\n\n“What’s that?”\n\n“Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too early.”\n\nSean dropped his shovel.\n\n“That’s it,” said he. “That’s the very trouble. We got to give this one up. We can’t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing’s too awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something’s behind me all the time;  and I’m afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there’s others in front a-waiting for a chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.”\n\n“Well, I’ve been pretty much so, too, Sean. They most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.”\n\n“Lordy!”\n\n“Yes, they do. I’ve always heard that.”\n\n“Jack, I don’t like to fool around much where there’s dead people. A body’s bound to get into trouble with ’em, sure.”\n\n“I don’t like to stir ’em up, either. S’pose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something!”\n\n“Don’t Jack! It’s awful.”\n\n“Well, it just is. Sean, I don’t feel comfortable a bit.”\n\n“Say, Jack, let’s give this place up, and try somewheres else.”\n\n“All right, I reckon we better.”\n\n“What’ll it be?”\n\nJack considered awhile; and then said:\n\n“The ha’nted house. That’s it!”\n\n“Blame it, I don’t like ha’nted houses, Jack. Why, they’re a dern sight worse’n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don’t come sliding around in a shroud, when you ain’t noticing, and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I couldn’t stand such a thing as that, Jack—nobody could.”\n\n“Yes, but, Sean, ghosts don’t travel around only at night. They won’t hender us from digging there in the daytime.”\n\n“Well, that’s so. But you know mighty well people don’t go about that ha’nted house in the day nor the night.”\n\n“Well, that’s mostly because they don’t like to go where a man’s been murdered, anyway—but nothing’s ever been seen around that house except in the night—just some blue lights slipping by the windows—no regular ghosts.”\n\n“Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Jack, you can bet there’s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz you know that they don’t anybody but ghosts use ’em.”\n\n“Yes, that’s so. But anyway they don’t come around in the daytime, so what’s the use of our being afeard?”\n\n“Well, all right. We’ll tackle the ha’nted house if you say so—but I reckon it’s taking chances.”\n\n25-198.jpg (97K)\nThey had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the moonlit valley below them stood the “ha’nted” house, utterly isolated, its fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof caved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n26-199.jpg (195K)\nAbout noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come for their tools. Jack was impatient to go to the haunted house; Sean was measurably so, also—but suddenly said:\n\n“Lookyhere, Jack, do you know what day it is?”\n\nJack mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them—\n\n“My! I never once thought of it, Sean!”\n\n“Well, I didn’t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday.”\n\n“Blame it, a body can’t be too careful, Sean. We might ’a’ got into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.”\n\n“Might! Better say we would! There’s some lucky days, maybe, but Friday ain’t.”\n\n“Any fool knows that. I don’t reckon you was the first that found it out, Sean.”\n\n“Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, neither. I had a rotten bad dream last night—dreampt about rats.”\n\n“No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Well, that’s good, Sean. When they don’t fight it’s only a sign that there’s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. We’ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Sean?”\n\n“No. Who’s Robin Hood?”\n\n“Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the best. He was a robber.”\n\n26-200.jpg (42K)\n“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”\n\n“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved ’em. He always divided up with ’em perfectly square.”\n\n“Well, he must ’a’ been a brick.”\n\n“I bet you he was, Sean. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was. They ain’t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.”\n\n“What’s a yew bow?”\n\n“I don’t know. It’s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse. But we’ll play Robin Hood—it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn you.”\n\n“I’m agreed.”\n\nSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow’s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill.\n\nOn Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again. They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their last hole, not with great hope, but merely because Jack said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this time, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.\n\nWhen they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun, and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown, floorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.\n\nIn a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs. This was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring each other, and of course there could be but one result—they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the promise was a fraud—there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now and well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when—\n\n“Sh!” said Jack.\n\n“What is it?” whispered Sean, blanching with fright.\n\n“Sh!... There!... Hear it?”\n\n“Yes!... Oh, my! Let’s run!”\n\n“Keep still! Don’t you budge! They’re coming right toward the door.”\n\nThe boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.\n\n“They’ve stopped.... No—coming.... Here they are. Don’t whisper another word, Sean. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!”\n\nTwo men entered. Each boy said to himself: “There’s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that’s been about town once or twice lately—never saw t’other man before.”\n\n“T’other” was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore green goggles. When they came in, “t’other” was talking in a low voice; they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:\n\n“No,” said he, “I’ve thought it all over, and I don’t like it. It’s dangerous.”\n\n“Dangerous!” grunted the “deaf and dumb” Spaniard—to the vast surprise of the boys. “Milksop!”\n\nThis voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Apache Bob’s! There was silence for some time. Then Stanley said:\n\n“What’s any more dangerous than that job up yonder—but nothing’s come of it.”\n\n“That’s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about. ’Twon’t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn’t succeed.”\n\n“Well, what’s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!—anybody would suspicion us that saw us.”\n\n“I know that. But there warn’t any other place as handy after that fool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it warn’t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view.”\n\n“Those infernal boys” quaked again under the inspiration of this remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a year.\n\nThe two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and thoughtful silence, Apache Bob said:\n\n“Look here, lad—you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there till you hear from me. I’ll take the chances on dropping into this town just once more, for a look. We’ll do that ‘dangerous’ job after I’ve spied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas! We’ll leg it together!”\n\nThis was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Apache Bob said:\n\n“I’m dead for sleep! It’s your turn to watch.”\n\nHe curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.\n\nThe boys drew a long, grateful breath. Jack whispered:\n\n“Now’s our chance—come!”\n\nSean said:\n\n“I can’t—I’d die if they was to wake.”\n\nJack urged—Sean held back. At last Jack rose slowly and softly, and started alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray; and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.\n\nNow one snore ceased. Apache Bob sat up, stared around—smiled grimly upon his comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees—stirred him up with his foot and said:\n\n“Here! You’re a watchman, ain’t you! All right, though—nothing’s happened.”\n\n“My! have I been asleep?”\n\n“Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What’ll we do with what little swag we’ve got left?”\n\n“I don’t know—leave it here as we’ve always done, I reckon. No use to take it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver’s something to carry.”\n\n“Well—all right—it won’t matter to come here once more.”\n\n“No—but I’d say come in the night as we used to do—it’s better.”\n\n“Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right chance at that job; accidents might happen; ’tain’t in such a very good place; we’ll just regularly bury it—and bury it deep.”\n\n“Good idea,” said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down, raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for Apache Bob, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on his knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.\n\nThe boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!—the splendor of it was beyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest auspices—there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig. They nudged each other every moment—eloquent nudges and easily understood, for they simply meant—“Oh, but ain’t you glad now we’re here!”\n\nStanley’s knife struck upon something.\n\n“Hello!” said he.\n\n“What is it?” said his comrade.\n\n“Half-rotten plank—no, it’s a box, I believe. Here—bear a hand and we’ll see what it’s here for. Never mind, I’ve broke a hole.”\n\nHe reached his hand in and drew it out—\n\n“Man, it’s money!”\n\nThe two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.\n\nStanley’s comrade said:\n\n“We’ll make quick work of this. There’s an old rusty pick over amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace—I saw it a minute ago.”\n\nHe ran and brought the boys’ pick and shovel. Apache Bob took the pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was not very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence.\n\n“Pard, there’s thousands of dollars here,” said Apache Bob.\n\n26-205.jpg (106K)\n“’Twas always said that Murrel’s gang used to be around here one summer,” the stranger observed.\n\n“I know it,” said Apache Bob; “and this looks like it, I should say.”\n\n“Now you won’t need to do that job.”\n\nThe halfbreed frowned. Said he:\n\n“You don’t know me. Least you don’t know all about that thing. ’Tain’t robbery altogether—it’s revenge!” and a wicked light flamed in his eyes. “I’ll need your help in it. When it’s finished—then Texas. Go home to your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.”\n\n“Well—if you say so; what’ll we do with this—bury it again?”\n\n“Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] No! by the great Sachem, no! [Profound distress overhead.] I’d nearly forgot. That pick had fresh earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business has a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on them? Who brought them here—and where are they gone? Have you heard anybody?—seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed? Not exactly—not exactly. We’ll take it to my den.”\n\n“Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number One?”\n\n“No—Number Two—under the cross. The other place is bad—too common.”\n\n“All right. It’s nearly dark enough to start.”\n\nApache Bob got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping out. Presently he said:\n\n“Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be upstairs?”\n\nThe boys’ breath forsook them. Apache Bob put his hand on his knife, halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The boys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came creaking up the stairs—the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads—they were about to spring for the closet, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Apache Bob landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself up cursing, and his comrade said:\n\n“Now what’s the use of all that? If it’s anybody, and they’re up there, let them stay there—who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes—and then let them follow us if they want to. I’m willing. In my opinion, whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something. I’ll bet they’re running yet.”\n\n26-207.jpg (56K)\nStanley grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving. Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.\n\nJack and Sean rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them through the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They were content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much absorbed in hating themselves—hating the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there. But for that, Apache Bob never would have suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his “revenge” was satisfied, and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there!\n\nThey resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to “Number Two,” wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to Jack.\n\n“Revenge? What if he means us, Sean!”\n\n“Oh, don’t!” said Sean, nearly fainting.\n\nThey talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he might possibly mean somebody else—at least that he might at least mean nobody but Jack, since only Jack had testified.\n\nVery, very small comfort it was to Jack to be alone in danger! Company would be a palpable improvement, he thought.\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n27-208.jpg (168K)\nThe adventure of the day mightily tormented Jack’s dreams that night. Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away—somewhat as if they had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There was one very strong argument in favor of this idea—namely, that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of his age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to “hundreds” and “thousands” were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one’s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.\n\nBut the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find Sean. Sean was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy. Jack concluded to let Sean lead up to the subject. If he did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream.\n\n“Hello, Sean!”\n\n“Hello, yourself.”\n\nSilence, for a minute.\n\n“Jack, if we’d ’a’ left the blame tools at the dead tree, we’d ’a’ got the money. Oh, ain’t it awful!”\n\n“’Tain’t a dream, then, ’tain’t a dream! Somehow I most wish it was. Dog’d if I don’t, Sean.”\n\n“What ain’t a dream?”\n\n“Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.”\n\n27-209.jpg (50K)\n“Dream! If them stairs hadn’t broke down you’d ’a’ seen how much dream it was! I’ve had dreams enough all night—with that patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through ’em—rot him!”\n\n“No, not rot him. Find him! Track the money!”\n\n“Jack, we’ll never find him. A feller don’t have only one chance for such a pile—and that one’s lost. I’d feel mighty shaky if I was to see him, anyway.”\n\n“Well, so’d I; but I’d like to see him, anyway—and track him out—to his Number Two.”\n\n“Number Two—yes, that’s it. I been thinking ’bout that. But I can’t make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?”\n\n“I dono. It’s too deep. Say, Sean—maybe it’s the number of a house!”\n\n“Goody!... No, Jack, that ain’t it. If it is, it ain’t in this one-horse town. They ain’t no numbers here.”\n\n“Well, that’s so. Lemme think a minute. Here—it’s the number of a room—in a tavern, you know!”\n\n“Oh, that’s the trick! They ain’t only two taverns. We can find out quick.”\n\n“You stay here, Sean, till I come.”\n\nJack was off at once. He did not care to have Sean’s company in public places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No. 2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied. In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper’s young son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any particular reason for this state of things; had had some little curiosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was “ha’nted”; had noticed that there was a light in there the night before.\n\n“That’s what I’ve found out, Sean. I reckon that’s the very No. 2 we’re after.”\n\n“I reckon it is, Jack. Now what you going to do?”\n\n“Lemme think.”\n\nJack thought a long time. Then he said:\n\n“I’ll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and I’ll nip all of auntie’s, and the first dark night we’ll go there and try ’em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Apache Bob, because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don’t go to that No. 2, that ain’t the place.”\n\n“Lordy, I don’t want to foller him by myself!”\n\n“Why, it’ll be night, sure. He mightn’t ever see you—and if he did, maybe he’d never think anything.”\n\n“Well, if it’s pretty dark I reckon I’ll track him. I dono—I dono. I’ll try.”\n\n“You bet I’ll follow him, if it’s dark, Sean. Why, he might ’a’ found out he couldn’t get his revenge, and be going right after that money.”\n\n“It’s so, Jack, it’s so. I’ll foller him; I will, by jingoes!”\n\n“Now you’re talking! Don’t you ever weaken, Sean, and I won’t.”\n\n27-211.jpg (46K)\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n28-212.jpg (189K)\nThat night Jack and Sean were ready for their adventure. They hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or left it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door. The night promised to be a fair one; so Jack went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Sean was to come and “maow,” whereupon he would slip out and try the keys. But the night remained clear, and Sean closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.\n\n28-213.jpg (50K)\nTuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday night promised better. Jack slipped out in good season with his aunt’s old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the lantern in Sean’s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts) were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned, the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder.\n\nJack got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern. Sean stood sentry and Jack felt his way into the alley. Then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Sean’s spirits like a mountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern—it would frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Jack was alive yet. It seemed hours since Jack had disappeared. Surely he must have fainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement. In his uneasiness Sean found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the way it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Jack came tearing by him: “Run!” said he; “run, for your life!”\n\nHe needn’t have repeated it; once was enough; Sean was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Jack got his breath he said:\n\n“Sean, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could; but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn’t hardly get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn’t turn in the lock, either. Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes the door! It warn’t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, Great Caesar’s Ghost!”\n\n28-214.jpg (95K)\n“What!—what’d you see, Jack?”\n\n“Sean, I most stepped onto Apache Bob’s hand!”\n\n“No!”\n\n“Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out.”\n\n“Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?”\n\n“No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and started!”\n\n“I’d never ’a’ thought of the towel, I bet!”\n\n“Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.”\n\n“Say, Jack, did you see that box?”\n\n“Sean, I didn’t wait to look around. I didn’t see the box, I didn’t see the cross. I didn’t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Apache Bob; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room. Don’t you see, now, what’s the matter with that ha’nted room?”\n\n“How?”\n\n“Why, it’s ha’nted with whiskey! Maybe all the Temperance Taverns have got a ha’nted room, hey, Sean?”\n\n“Well, I reckon maybe that’s so. Who’d ’a’ thought such a thing? But say, Jack, now’s a mighty good time to get that box, if Apache Bob’s drunk.”\n\n“It is, that! You try it!”\n\nSean shuddered.\n\n“Well, no—I reckon not.”\n\n“And I reckon not, Sean. Only one bottle alongside of Apache Bob ain’t enough. If there’d been three, he’d be drunk enough and I’d do it.”\n\nThere was a long pause for reflection, and then Jack said:\n\n“Lookyhere, Sean, less not try that thing any more till we know Apache Bob’s not in there. It’s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we’ll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we’ll snatch that box quicker’n lightning.”\n\n“Well, I’m agreed. I’ll watch the whole night long, and I’ll do it every night, too, if you’ll do the other part of the job.”\n\n“All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block and maow—and if I’m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window and that’ll fetch me.”\n\n“Agreed, and good as wheat!”\n\n“Now, Sean, the storm’s over, and I’ll go home. It’ll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will you?”\n\n“I said I would, Jack, and I will. I’ll ha’nt that tavern every night for a year! I’ll sleep all day and I’ll stand watch all night.”\n\n“That’s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?”\n\n“In Henry Sparks’ hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap’s nigger man, Uncle Charlie. I tote water for Uncle Charlie whenever he wants me to, and any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it. That’s a mighty good nigger, Jack. He likes me, becuz I don’t ever act as if I was above him. Sometime I’ve set right down and eat with him. But you needn’t tell that. A body’s got to do things when he’s awful hungry he wouldn’t want to do as a steady thing.”\n\n“Well, if I don’t want you in the daytime, I’ll let you sleep. I won’t come bothering around. Any time you see something’s up, in the night, just skip right around and maow.”\n\n28-216.jpg (49K)\nCHAPTER XXIX\n29-217.jpg (198K)\nThe first thing Jack heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news—Judge Goodwin’s family had come back to town the night before. Both Apache Bob and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment, and Clara took the chief place in the boy’s interest. He saw her and they had an exhausting good time playing “hispy” and “gully-keeper” with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way: Clara teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she consented. The child’s delight was boundless; and Jack’s not more moderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation. Jack’s excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Sean’s “maow,” and of having his treasure to astonish Clara and the picnickers with, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.\n\nMorning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Goodwin’s, and everything was ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision-baskets. Eli was sick and had to miss the fun; Anna remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs. Goodwin said to Clara, was:\n\n“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”\n\n“Then I’ll stay with Jane Brooks, mamma.”\n\n“Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”\n\nPresently, as they tripped along, Jack said to Clara:\n\n“Say—I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ’Stead of going to Stanley Brooks’s we’ll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Campbell’. She’ll have ice-cream! She has it most every day—dead loads of it. And she’ll be awful glad to have us.”\n\n“Oh, that will be fun!”\n\nThen Clara reflected a moment and said:\n\n“But what will mamma say?”\n\n“How’ll she ever know?”\n\nThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:\n\n“I reckon it’s wrong—but—”\n\n“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she wants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ’a’ said go there if she’d ’a’ thought of it. I know she would!”\n\nThe Widow Campbell’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and Jack’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to Jack that maybe Sean might come this very night and give the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Campbell’. And why should he give it up, he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before, so why should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day.\n\nThree miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:\n\n“Who’s ready for the cave?”\n\nEverybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the hillside—an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal’s cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and still down, into the earth, and it was just the same—labyrinth under labyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the cave. That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Jack Torrance knew as much of the cave as any one.\n\n29-220.jpg (101K)\nThe procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the “known” ground.\n\nBy-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of the day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had been calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day’s adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft.\n\n29-221.jpg (52K)\nSean was already upon his watch when the ferryboat’s lights went glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not stop at the wharf—and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten o’clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disap",

    "context": "lidahs were nearly across, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly, snarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom.\n\n“Well,” said the Fang, drawing a long breath of relief, “I see we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it, for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creatures frightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.”\n\n“Ah,” said the Iron Lumberjack sadly, “I wish I had a heart to beat.”\n\nThis adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the forest, and they walked so fast that Elara became tired, and had to ride on the Fang’s back. To their great joy the trees became thinner the farther they advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river, flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of the water they could see the road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country, with green meadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging full of delicious fruits. They were greatly pleased to see this delightful country before them.\n\n“How shall we cross the river?” asked Elara.\n\n“That is easily done,” replied the Strawman. “The Iron Lumberjack must build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.”\n\nSo the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft, and while he was busy at this the Strawman found on the riverbank a tree full of fine fruit. This pleased Elara, who had eaten nothing but nuts all day, and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit.\n\nBut it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and untiring as the Iron Lumberjack, and when night came the work was not done. So they found a cozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning; and Elara dreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good Wizard Zor, who would soon send her back to her own home again.\n\nChapter VIII\nThe Deadly Poppy Field\nOur little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of hope, and Elara breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the trees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely through, although they had suffered many discouragements; but before them was a lovely, sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.\n\nTo be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land. But the raft was nearly done, and after the Iron Lumberjack had cut a few more logs and fastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready to start. Elara sat down in the middle of the raft and held Milo in her arms. When the Fang stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he was big and heavy; but the Strawman and the Iron Lumberjack stood upon the other end to steady it, and they had long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water.\n\nThey got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of the river the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and farther away from the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep that the long poles would not touch the bottom.\n\n“This is bad,” said the Iron Lumberjack, “for if we cannot get to the land we shall be carried into the country of the Malevolent Witch of Western Wastes, and she will enchant us and make us her slaves.”\n\n“And then I should get no brains,” said the Strawman.\n\n“And I should get no courage,” said the Fang.\n\n“And I should get no heart,” said the Iron Lumberjack.\n\n“And I should never get back to Kansas,” said Elara.\n\n“We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,” the Strawman continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out again—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Strawman was left clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.\n\n“Good-bye!” he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave him. Indeed, the Iron Lumberjack began to cry, but fortunately remembered that he might rust, and so dried his tears on Elara’s apron.\n\nOf course this was a bad thing for the Strawman.\n\n“I am now worse off than when I first met Elara,” he thought. “Then, I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe scare the crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Strawman stuck on a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never have any brains, after all!”\n\nDown the stream the raft floated, and the poor Strawman was left far behind. Then the Fang said:\n\n“Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and pull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my tail.”\n\nSo he sprang into the water, and the Iron Lumberjack caught fast hold of his tail. Then the Fang began to swim with all his might toward the shore. It was hard work, although he was so big; but by and by they were drawn out of the current, and then Elara took the Iron Lumberjack’s long pole and helped push the raft to the land.\n\nThey were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off upon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carried them a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City.\n\n“What shall we do now?” asked the Iron Lumberjack, as the Fang lay down on the grass to let the sun dry him.\n\n“We must get back to the road, in some way,” said Elara.\n\n“The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the road again,” remarked the Fang.\n\nSo, when they were rested, Elara picked up her basket and they started along the grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them. It was a lovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer them, and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Strawman, they could have been very happy.\n\nThey walked along as fast as they could, Elara only stopping once to pick a beautiful flower; and after a time the Iron Lumberjack cried out: “Look!”\n\nThen they all looked at the river and saw the Strawman perched upon his pole in the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.\n\n“What can we do to save him?” asked Elara.\n\nThe Fang and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know. So they sat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Strawman until a Stork flew by, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water’s edge.\n\n“Who are you and where are you going?” asked the Stork.\n\n“I am Elara,” answered the girl, “and these are my friends, the Iron Lumberjack and the Fang; and we are going to the Emerald City.”\n\n“This isn’t the road,” said the Stork, as she twisted her long neck and looked sharply at the queer party.\n\n“I know it,” returned Elara, “but we have lost the Strawman, and are wondering how we shall get him again.”\n\n“Where is he?” asked the Stork.\n\n“Over there in the river,” answered the little girl.\n\n“If he wasn’t so big and heavy I would get him for you,” remarked the Stork.\n\n“He isn’t heavy a bit,” said Elara eagerly, “for he is stuffed with straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you ever and ever so much.”\n\n“Well, I’ll try,” said the Stork, “but if I find he is too heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again.”\n\nSo the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the Strawman was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her great claws grabbed the Strawman by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to the bank, where Elara and the Fang and the Iron Lumberjack and Milo were sitting.\n\nWhen the Strawman found himself among his friends again, he was so happy that he hugged them all, even the Fang and Milo; and as they walked along he sang “Tol-de-ri-de-oh!” at every step, he felt so gay.\n\n“I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,” he said, “but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find the Stork again and do her some kindness in return.”\n\n“That’s all right,” said the Stork, who was flying along beside them. “I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now, for my babies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald City and that Zor will help you.”\n\n“Thank you,” replied Elara, and then the kind Stork flew into the air and was soon out of sight.\n\nThey walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and looking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was carpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies, which were so brilliant in color they almost dazzled Elara’s eyes.\n\n“Aren’t they beautiful?” the girl asked, as she breathed in the spicy scent of the bright flowers.\n\n“I suppose so,” answered the Strawman. “When I have brains, I shall probably like them better.”\n\n“If I only had a heart, I should love them,” added the Iron Lumberjack.\n\n“I always did like flowers,” said the Fang. “They seem so helpless and frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.”\n\nThey now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer and fewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a great meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when there are many of these flowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls asleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers, he sleeps on and on forever. But Elara did not know this, nor could she get away from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her eyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.\n\nBut the Iron Lumberjack would not let her do this.\n\n“We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before dark,” he said; and the Strawman agreed with him. So they kept walking until Elara could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and she forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.\n\n“What shall we do?” asked the Iron Lumberjack.\n\n“If we leave her here she will die,” said the Fang. “The smell of the flowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes open, and the dog is asleep already.”\n\nIt was true; Milo had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the Strawman and the Iron Lumberjack, not being made of flesh, were not troubled by the scent of the flowers.\n\n“Run fast,” said the Strawman to the Fang, “and get out of this deadly flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with us, but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.”\n\nSo the Fang aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go. In a moment he was out of sight.\n\n“Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,” said the Strawman. So they picked up Milo and put the dog in Elara’s lap, and then they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the arms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.\n\nOn and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers that surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of the river, and at last came upon their friend the Fang, lying fast asleep among the poppies. The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last, and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet grass spread in beautiful green fields before them.\n\n“We can do nothing for him,” said the Iron Lumberjack, sadly; “for he is much too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on forever, and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.”\n\n“I’m sorry,” said the Strawman. “The Fang was a very good comrade for one so cowardly. But let us go on.”\n\nThey carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far enough from the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the flowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the fresh breeze to waken her.\n\nChapter IX\nThe Queen Minerva of the Field Mice\n“We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,” remarked the Strawman, as he stood beside the girl, “for we have come nearly as far as the river carried us away.”\n\nThe Iron Lumberjack was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and turning his head (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange beast come bounding over the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great yellow Wildcat, and the Woodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to its head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its red eyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Iron Lumberjack saw that running before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no heart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty, harmless creature.\n\nSo the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a quick blow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body, and it rolled over at his feet in two pieces.\n\nThe field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short; and coming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:\n\n“Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.”\n\n“Don’t speak of it, I beg of you,” replied the Woodman. “I have no heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may need a friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.”\n\n“Only a mouse!” cried the little animal, indignantly. “Why, I am a Queen Minerva—the Queen Minerva of all the Field Mice!”\n\n“Oh, indeed,” said the Woodman, making a bow.\n\n“Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in saving my life,” added the Queen Minerva.\n\nAt that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs could carry them, and when they saw their Queen Minerva they exclaimed:\n\n“Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage to escape the great Wildcat?” They all bowed so low to the little Queen Minerva that they almost stood upon their heads.\n\n“This funny tin man,” she answered, “killed the Wildcat and saved my life. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest wish.”\n\n“We will!” cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they scampered in all directions, for Milo had awakened from his sleep, and seeing all these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the middle of the group. Milo had always loved to chase mice when he lived in Kansas, and he saw no harm in it.\n\nBut the Iron Lumberjack caught the dog in his arms and held him tight, while he called to the mice, “Come back! Come back! Milo shall not hurt you.”\n\nAt this the Queen Minerva of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of grass and asked, in a timid voice, “Are you sure he will not bite us?”\n\n“I will not let him,” said the Woodman; “so do not be afraid.”\n\nOne by one the mice came creeping back, and Milo did not bark again, although he tried to get out of the Woodman’s arms, and would have bitten him had he not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one of the biggest mice spoke.\n\n“Is there anything we can do,” it asked, “to repay you for saving the life of our Queen Minerva?”\n\n“Nothing that I know of,” answered the Woodman; but the Strawman, who had been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed with straw, said, quickly, “Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the Fang, who is asleep in the poppy bed.”\n\n“A Fang!” cried the little Queen Minerva. “Why, he would eat us all up.”\n\n“Oh, no,” declared the Strawman; “this Fang is a coward.”\n\n“Really?” asked the Minerva.\n\n“He says so himself,” answered the Strawman, “and he would never hurt anyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promise that he shall treat you all with kindness.”\n\n“Very well,” said the Queen Minerva, “we trust you. But what shall we do?”\n\n“Are there many of these mice which call you Queen Minerva and are willing to obey you?”\n\n“Oh, yes; there are thousands,” she replied.\n\n“Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each one bring a long piece of string.”\n\nThe Queen Minerva turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and get all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every direction as fast as possible.\n\n“Now,” said the Strawman to the Iron Lumberjack, “you must go to those trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Fang.”\n\nSo the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon made a truck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all the leaves and branches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out of short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast and so well did he work that by the time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them.\n\nThey came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big mice and little mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a piece of string in his mouth. It was about this time that Elara woke from her long sleep and opened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the grass, with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly. But the Strawman told her about everything, and turning to the dignified little Minerva, he said:\n\n“Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen Minerva.”\n\nElara nodded gravely and the Queen Minerva made a curtsy, after which she became quite friendly with the little girl.\n\nThe Strawman and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck, using the strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied around the neck of each mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course the truck was a thousand times bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it; but when all the mice had been harnessed, they were able to pull it quite easily. Even the Strawman and the Iron Lumberjack could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer little horses to the place where the Fang lay asleep.\n\nAfter a great deal of hard work, for the Fang was heavy, they managed to get him up on the truck. Then the Queen Minerva hurriedly gave her people the order to start, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also would fall asleep.\n\nAt first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir the heavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Strawman both pushed from behind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Fang out of the poppy bed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet, fresh air again, instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.\n\nElara came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her companion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Fang she was glad he had been rescued.\n\nThen the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the grass to their homes. The Queen Minerva of the Mice was the last to leave.\n\n“If ever you need us again,” she said, “come out into the field and call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance. Good-bye!”\n\n“Good-bye!” they all answered, and away the Queen Minerva ran, while Elara held Milo tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.\n\nAfter this they sat down beside the Fang until he should awaken; and the Strawman brought Elara some fruit from a tree near by, which she ate for her dinner.\n\nChapter X\nThe Guardian of the Gate\nIt was some time before the Fang awakened, for he had lain among the poppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance; but when he did open his eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive.\n\n“I ran as fast as I could,” he said, sitting down and yawning, “but the flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?”\n\nThen they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved him from death; and the Fang laughed, and said:\n\n“I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little things as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as mice have saved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what shall we do now?”\n\n“We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,” said Elara, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.”\n\nSo, the Fang being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they all started upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh grass; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and turned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Zor dwelt.\n\nThe road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful, so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with it the many dangers they had me",

I don’t believe I could have the heart to go on with my studies at all if another teacher came here.”\n\nWhen Clara got home that night she stacked all her textbooks away in an old trunk in the attic, locked it, and threw the key into the blanket box.\n\n“I’m not even going to look at a schoolbook in vacation,” she told Edna. “I’ve studied as hard all the term as I possibly could and I’ve pored over that geometry until I know every proposition in the first book off by heart, even when the letters are changed. I just feel tired of everything sensible and I’m going to let my imagination run riot for the summer. Oh, you needn’t be alarmed, Edna. I’ll only let it run riot within reasonable limits. But I want to have a real good jolly time this summer, for maybe it’s the last summer I’ll be a little girl. Mrs. Harper says that if I keep stretching out next year as I’ve done this I’ll have to put on longer skirts. She says I’m all running to legs and eyes. And when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I have to live up to them and be very dignified. It won’t even do to believe in fairies then, I’m afraid; so I’m going to believe in them with all my whole heart this summer. I think we’re going to have a very gay vacation. Coral Hayes is going to have a birthday party soon and there’s the Sunday-school picnic and the missionary concert next month. And Mr. Greene says that some evening he’ll take Sophia and me over to the White Sands Hotel and have dinner there. They have dinner there in the evening, you know. Martha Chapman was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling sight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests in such beautiful dresses. Martha says it was her first glimpse into high life and she’ll never forget it to her dying day.”\n\nMrs. Harper came up the next afternoon to find out why Edna had not been at the Aid meeting on Thursday. When Edna was not at Aid meeting people knew there was something wrong at Green Gables.\n\n“Donald had a bad spell with his heart Thursday,” Edna explained, “and I didn’t feel like leaving him. Oh, yes, he’s all right again now, but he takes them spells oftener than he used to and I’m anxious about him. The doctor says he must be careful to avoid excitement. That’s easy enough, for Donald doesn’t go about looking for excitement by any means and never did, but he’s not to do any very heavy work either and you might as well tell Donald not to breathe as not to work. Come and lay off your things, Beatrice. You’ll stay to tea?”\n\n“Well, seeing you’re so pressing, perhaps I might as well, stay” said Mrs. Beatrice, who had not the slightest intention of doing anything else.\n\nMrs. Beatrice and Edna sat comfortably in the parlor while Clara got the tea and made hot biscuits that were light and white enough to defy even Mrs. Beatrice’s criticism.\n\n“I must say Clara has turned out a real smart girl,” admitted Mrs. Beatrice, as Edna accompanied her to the end of the lane at sunset. “She must be a great help to you.”\n\n“She is,” said Edna, “and she’s real steady and reliable now. I used to be afraid she’d never get over her featherbrained ways, but she has and I wouldn’t be afraid to trust her in anything now.”\n\n“I never would have thought she’d have turned out so well that first day I was here three years ago,” said Mrs. Beatrice. “Lawful heart, shall I ever forget that tantrum of hers! When I went home that night I says to Wilson, says I, ‘Mark my words, Wilson, Edna Forsythe ‘ll live to rue the step she’s took.’ But I was mistaken and I’m real glad of it. I ain’t one of those kind of people, Edna, as can never be brought to own up that they’ve made a mistake. No, that never was my way, thank goodness. I did make a mistake in judging Clara, but it weren’t no wonder, for an odder, unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in this world, that’s what. There was no ciphering her out by the rules that worked with other children. It’s nothing short of wonderful how she’s improved these three years, but especially in looks. She’s a real pretty girl got to be, though I can’t say I’m overly partial to that pale, big-eyed style myself. I like more snap and color, like Sophia Greene has or Coral Hayes. Coral Hayes’s looks are real showy. But somehow—I don’t know how it is but when Clara and them are together, though she ain’t half as handsome, she makes them look kind of common and overdone—something like them white June lilies she calls narcissus alongside of the big, red peonies, that’s what.”\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\nWhere the Brook and River Meet\nANNE had her “good” summer and enjoyed it wholeheartedly. She and Sophia fairly lived outdoors, reveling in all the delights that Lover’s Lane and the Dryad’s Bubble and Willowmere and Amelia Island afforded. Edna offered no objections to Clara’s gypsyings. The Spencervale doctor who had come the night Dolly had the croup met Clara at the house of a patient one afternoon early in vacation, looked her over sharply, screwed up his mouth, shook his head, and sent a message to Edna Forsythe by another person. It was:\n\n“Keep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and don’t let her read books until she gets more spring into her step.”\n\nThis message frightened Edna wholesomely. She read Clara’s death warrant by consumption in it unless it was scrupulously obeyed. As a result, Clara had the golden summer of her life as far as freedom and frolic went. She walked, rowed, berried, and dreamed to her heart’s content; and when September came she was bright-eyed and alert, with a step that would have satisfied the Spencervale doctor and a heart full of ambition and zest once more.\n\n“I feel just like studying with might and main,” she declared as she brought her books down from the attic. “Oh, you good old friends, I’m glad to see your honest faces once more—yes, even you, geometry. I’ve had a perfectly beautiful summer, Edna, and now I’m rejoicing as a strong man to run a race, as Mr. Drake said last Sunday. Doesn’t Mr. Drake preach magnificent sermons? Mrs. Harper says he is improving every day and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up and then we’ll be left and have to turn to and break in another green preacher. But I don’t see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you, Edna? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Drake while we have him. If I were a man I think I’d be a minister. They can have such an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be thrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers’ hearts. Why can’t women be ministers, Edna? I asked Mrs. Harper that and she was shocked and said it would be a scandalous thing. She said there might be female ministers in the States and she believed there was, but thank goodness we hadn’t got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we never would. But I don’t see why. I think women would make splendid ministers. When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or anything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work. I’m sure Mrs. Harper can pray every bit as well as William Carter and I’ve no doubt she could preach too with a little practice.”\n\n“Yes, I believe she could,” said Edna dryly. “She does plenty of unofficial preaching as it is. Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong in Avonlea with Beatrice to oversee them.”\n\n“Edna,” said Clara in a burst of confidence, “I want to tell you something and ask you what you think about it. It has worried me terribly—on Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about such matters. I do really want to be good; and when I’m with you or Mrs. Grace Drake or Miss Penelope I want it more than ever and I want to do just what would please you and what you would approve of. But mostly when I’m with Mrs. Harper I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the very thing she tells me I oughtn’t to do. I feel irresistibly tempted to do it. Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you think it’s because I’m really bad and unregenerate?”\n\nEdna looked dubious for a moment. Then she laughed.\n\n“If you are I guess I am too, Clara, for Beatrice often has that very effect on me. I sometimes think she’d have more of an influence for good, as you say yourself, if she didn’t keep nagging people to do right. There should have been a special commandment against nagging. But there, I shouldn’t talk so. Beatrice is a good Christian woman and she means well. There isn’t a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks her share of work.”\n\n“I’m very glad you feel the same,” said Clara decidedly. “It’s so encouraging. I shan’t worry so much over that after this. But I dare say there’ll be other things to worry me. They keep coming up new all the time—things to perplex you, you know. You settle one question and there’s another right after. There are so many things to be thought over and decided when you’re beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right. It’s a serious thing to grow up, isn’t it, Edna? But when I have such good friends as you and Donald and Mrs. Grace Drake and Miss Penelope I ought to grow up successfully, and I’m sure it will be my own fault if I don’t. I feel it’s a great responsibility because I have only the one chance. If I don’t grow up right I can’t go back and begin over again. I’ve grown two inches this summer, Edna. Mr. Gillis measured me at Coral’s party. I’m so glad you made my new dresses longer. That dark-green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. Of course I know it wasn’t really necessary, but flounces are so stylish this fall and Hannah Ford has flounces on all her dresses. I know I’ll be able to study better because of mine. I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my mind about that flounce.”\n\n“It’s worth something to have that,” admitted Edna.\n\nMiss Penelope came back to Avonlea school and found all her pupils eager for work once more. Especially did the Queen’s class gird up their loins for the fray, for at the end of the coming year, dimly shadowing their pathway already, loomed up that fateful thing known as “the Entrance,” at the thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their very shoes. Suppose they did not pass! That thought was doomed to haunt Clara through the waking hours of that winter, Sunday afternoons inclusive, to the almost entire exclusion of moral and theological problems. When Clara had bad dreams she found herself staring miserably at pass lists of the Entrance exams, where Rowan Blake’s name was blazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at all.\n\nBut it was a jolly, busy, happy swift-flying winter. Schoolwork was as interesting, class rivalry as absorbing, as of yore. New worlds of thought, feeling, and ambition, fresh, fascinating fields of unexplored knowledge seemed to be opening out before Clara’s eager eyes.\n\n“Hills peeped o’er hill and Alps on Alps arose.”\n\nMuch of all this was due to Miss Penelope’s tactful, careful, broadminded guidance. She led her class to think and explore and discover for themselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree that quite shocked Mrs. Harper and the school trustees, who viewed all innovations on established methods rather dubiously.\n\nApart from her studies Clara expanded socially, for Edna, mindful of the Spencervale doctor’s dictum, no longer vetoed occasional outings. The Debating Club flourished and gave several concerts; there were one or two parties almost verging on grown-up affairs; there were sleigh drives and skating frolics galore.\n\nBetween times Clara grew, shooting up so rapidly that Edna was astonished one day, when they were standing side by side, to find the girl was taller than herself.\n\n“Why, Clara, how you’ve grown!” she said, almost unbelievingly. A sigh followed on the words. Edna felt a queer regret over Clara’s inches. The child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this tall, serious-eyed girl of fifteen, with the thoughtful brows and the proudly poised little head, in her place. Edna loved the girl as much as she had loved the child, but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful sense of loss. And that night, when Clara had gone to prayer meeting with Sophia, Edna sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the weakness of a cry. Donald, coming in with a lantern, caught her at it and gazed at her in such consternation that Edna had to laugh through her tears.\n\n“I was thinking about Clara,” she explained. “She’s got to be such a big girl—and she’ll probably be away from us next winter. I’ll miss her terrible.”\n\n“She’ll be able to come home often,” comforted Donald, to whom Clara was as yet and always would be the little, eager girl he had brought home from Bright River on that June evening four years before. “The branch railroad will be built to Carmody by that time.”\n\n“It won’t be the same thing as having her here all the time,” sighed Edna gloomily, determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted. “But there—men can’t understand these things!”\n\nThere were other changes in Clara no less real than the physical change. For one thing, she became much quieter. Perhaps she thought all the more and dreamed as much as ever, but she certainly talked less. Edna noticed and commented on this also.\n\n“You don’t chatter half as much as you used to, Clara, nor use half as many big words. What has come over you?”\n\nClara colored and laughed a little, as she dropped her book and looked dreamily out of the window, where big fat red buds were bursting out on the creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine.\n\n“I don’t know—I don’t want to talk as much,” she said, denting her chin thoughtfully with her forefinger. “It’s nicer to think dear, pretty thoughts and keep them in one’s heart, like treasures. I don’t like to have them laughed at or wondered over. And somehow I don’t want to use big words any more. It’s almost a pity, isn’t it, now that I’m really growing big enough to say them if I did want to. It’s fun to be almost grown up in some ways, but it’s not the kind of fun I expected, Edna. There’s so much to learn and do and think that there isn’t time for big words. Besides, Miss Penelope says the short ones are much stronger and better. She makes us write all our essays as simply as possible. It was hard at first. I was so used to crowding in all the fine big words I could think of—and I thought of any number of them. But I’ve got used to it now and I see it’s so much better.”\n\n“What has become of your story club? I haven’t heard you speak of it for a long time.”\n\n“The story club isn’t in existence any longer. We hadn’t time for it—and anyhow I think we had got tired of it. It was silly to be writing about love and murder and elopements and mysteries. Miss Penelope sometimes has us write a story for training in composition, but she won’t let us write anything but what might happen in Avonlea in our own lives, and she criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own too. I never thought my compositions had so many faults until I began to look for them myself. I felt so ashamed I wanted to give up altogether, but Miss Penelope said I could learn to write well if I only trained myself to be my own severest critic. And so I am trying to.”\n\n“You’ve only two more months before the Entrance,” said Edna. “Do you think you’ll be able to get through?”\n\nClara shivered.\n\n“I don’t know. Sometimes I think I’ll be all right—and then I get horribly afraid. We’ve studied hard and Miss Penelope has drilled us thoroughly, but we mayn’t get through for all that. We’ve each got a stumbling block. Mine is geometry of course, and Martha’s is Latin, and Coral and Jack’s is algebra, and Hannah’s is arithmetic. Percy says he feels it in his bones that he is going to fail in English history. Miss Penelope is going to give us examinations in June just as hard as we’ll have at the Entrance and mark us just as strictly, so we’ll have some idea. I wish it was all over, Edna. It haunts me. Sometimes I wake up in the night and wonder what I’ll do if I don’t pass.”\n\n“Why, go to school next year and try again,” said Edna unconcernedly.\n\n“Oh, I don’t believe I’d have the heart for it. It would be such a disgrace to fail, especially if Gil—if the others passed. And I get so nervous in an examination that I’m likely to make a mess of it. I wish I had nerves like Martha Chapman. Nothing rattles her.”\n\nClara sighed and, dragging her eyes from the witcheries of the spring world, the beckoning day of breeze and blue, and the green things upspringing in the garden, buried herself resolutely in her book. There would be other springs, but if she did not succeed in passing the Entrance, Clara felt convinced that she would never recover sufficiently to enjoy them.\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\nThe Pass List Is Out\nWITH the end of June came the close of the term and the close of Miss Penelope’s rule in Avonlea school. Clara and Sophia walked home that evening feeling very sober indeed. Red eyes and damp handkerchiefs bore convincing testimony to the fact that Miss Penelope’s farewell words must have been quite as touching as Mr. Edwards’s had been under similar circumstances three years before. Sophia looked back at the schoolhouse from the foot of the spruce hill and sighed deeply.\n\n“It does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn’t it?” she said dismally.\n\n“You oughtn’t to feel half as badly as I do,” said Clara, hunting vainly for a dry spot on her handkerchief. “You’ll be back again next winter, but I suppose I’ve left the dear old school forever—if I have good luck, that is.”\n\n“It won’t be a bit the same. Miss Penelope won’t be there, nor you nor Martha nor Coral probably. I shall have to sit all alone, for I couldn’t bear to have another deskmate after you. Oh, we have had jolly times, haven’t we, Clara? It’s dreadful to think they’re all over.”\n\nTwo big tears rolled down by Sophia’s nose.\n\n“If you would stop crying I could,” said Clara imploringly. “Just as soon as I put away my hanky I see you brimming up and that starts me off again. As Mrs. Harper says, ‘If you can’t be cheerful, be as cheerful as you can.’ After all, I dare say I’ll be back next year. This is one of the times I know I’m not going to pass. They’re getting alarmingly frequent.”\n\n“Why, you came out splendidly in the exams Miss Penelope gave.”\n\n“Yes, but those exams didn’t make me nervous. When I think of the real thing you can’t imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round my heart. And then my number is thirteen and Hannah Ford says it’s so unlucky. I am not superstitious and I know it can make no difference. But still I wish it wasn’t thirteen.”\n\n“I do wish I was going in with you,” said Sophia. “Wouldn’t we have a perfectly elegant time? But I suppose you’ll have to cram in the evenings.”\n\n“No; Miss Penelope has made us promise not to open a book at all. She says it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not think about the exams at all and go to bed early. It’s good advice, but I expect it will be hard to follow; good advice is apt to be, I think. Lena Chapman told me that she sat up half the night every night of her Entrance week and crammed for dear life; and I had determined to sit up at least as long as she did. It was so kind of your Aunt Claudia to ask me to stay at Beechwood while I’m in town.”\n\n“You’ll write to me while you’re in, won’t you?”\n\n“I’ll write Tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes,” promised Clara.\n\n“I’ll be haunting the post office Wednesday,” vowed Sophia.\n\nClara went to town the following Monday and on Wednesday Sophia haunted the post office, as agreed, and got her letter.\n\n“Dearest Sophia” [wrote Clara],\n\n“Here it is Tuesday night and I’m writing this in the library at Beechwood. Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and wished so much you were with me. I couldn’t ‘cram’ because I’d promised Miss Penelope not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history as it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were learned.\n\n“This morning Miss Penelope came for me and we went to the Academy, calling for Martha and Coral and Hannah on our way. Coral asked me to feel her hands and they were as cold as ice. Hannah said I looked as if I hadn’t slept a wink and she didn’t believe I was strong enough to stand the grind of the teacher’s course even if I did get through. There are times and seasons even yet when I don’t feel that I’ve made any great headway in learning to like Hannah Ford!\n\n“When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from all over the Island. The first person we saw was Percy sitting on the steps and muttering away to himself. Martha asked him what on earth he was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over and over to steady his nerves and for pity’s sake not to interrupt him, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot everything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts firmly in their proper place!\n\n“When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Penelope had to leave us. Martha and I sat together and Martha was so composed that I envied her. No need of the multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Martha! I wondered if I looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear across the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English examination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as I picked it up. Just one awful moment—Sophia, I felt exactly as I did four years ago when I asked Edna if I might stay at Green Gables—and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again—I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!—for I knew I could do something with that paper anyhow.\n\n“At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in the afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully mixed up in the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh, Sophia, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it it takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my Euclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would recite it from now till tomorrow morning.\n\n“I went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Percy wandering distractedly around. He said he knew he had failed in history and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he was going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a carpenter than a minister, anyhow. I cheered him up and persuaded him to stay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Penelope if he didn’t. Sometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Percy I’m always glad I’m a girl and not his sister.\n\n“Coral was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just discovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When she recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had been with us.\n\n“Oh, Sophia, if only the geometry examination were over! But there, as Mrs. Harper would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I fail in geometry or not. That is true but not especially comforting. I think I’d rather it didn’t go on if I failed!\n\n“Yours devotedly,\n\n“Clara”\n\nThe geometry examination and all the others were over in due time and Clara arrived home on Friday evening, rather tired but with an air of chastened triumph about her. Sophia was over at Green Gables when she arrived and they met as if they had been parted for years.\n\n“You old darling, it’s perfectly splendid to see you back again. It seems like an age since you went to town and oh, Clara, how did you get along?”\n\n“Pretty well, I think, in everything but the geometry. I don’t know whether I passed in it or not and I have a creepy, crawly presentiment that I didn’t. Oh, how good it is to be back! Green Gables is the dearest, loveliest spot in the world.”\n\n“How did the others do?”\n\n“The girls say they know they didn’t pass, but I think they did pretty well. Hannah says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it! Percy still thinks he failed in history and Jack says he failed in algebra. But we don’t really know anything about it and won’t until the pass list is out. That won’t be for a fortnight. Fancy living a fortnight in such suspense! I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up until it is over.”\n\nSophia knew it would be useless to ask how Rowan Blake had fared, so she merely said:\n\n“Oh, you’ll pass all right. Don’t worry.”\n\n“I’d rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the list,” flashed Clara, by which she meant—and Sophia knew she meant—that success would be incomplete and bitter if she did not come out ahead of Rowan Blake.\n\nWith this end in view Clara had strained every nerve during the examinations. So had Rowan. They had met and passed each other on the street a dozen times without any sign of recognition and every time Clara had held her head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly that she had made friends with Rowan when he asked her, and vowed a little more determinedly to surpass him in the examination. She knew that all Avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first; she even knew that Simon Cook and Fred Grant had a bet on the question and that Hannah Ford had said there was no doubt in the world that Rowan would be first; and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if she failed.\n\nBut she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well. She wanted to “pass high” for the sake of Donald and Edna—especially Donald. Donald had declared to her his conviction that she “would beat the whole Island.” That, Clara felt, was something it would be foolish to hope for even in the wildest dreams. But she did hope fervently that she would be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Donald’s kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement. That, she felt, would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient grubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations.\n\nAt the end of the fortnight Clara took to “haunting” the post office also, in the distracted company of Martha, Coral, and Hannah, opening the Charlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold, sinkaway feelings as bad as any experienced during the Entrance week. Jack and Rowan were not above doing this too, but Percy stayed resolutely away.\n\n“I haven’t got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood,” he told Clara. “I’m just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me suddenly whether I’ve passed or not.”\n\nWhen three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing Clara began to feel that she really couldn’t stand the strain much longer. Her appetite failed and her interest in Avonlea doings languished. Mrs. Harper wanted to know what else you could expect with a Tory superintendent of education at the head of affairs, and Donald, noting Clara’s paleness and indifference and the lagging steps that bore her home from the post office every afternoon, began seriously to wonder if he hadn’t better vote Grit at the next election.\n\nBut one evening the news came. Clara was sitting at her open window, for the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the world, as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with flower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the stir of poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west, and Clara was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked like that, when she saw Sophia come flying down through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a fluttering newspaper in her hand.\n\nClara sprang to her feet, knowing at once what that paper contained. The pass list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt her. She could not move a step. It seemed an hour to her before Sophia came rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even knocking, so great was her excitement.\n\n“Clara, you’ve passed,” she cried, “passed the very first—you and Rowan both—you’re ties—but your name is first. Oh, I’m so proud!”\n\nSophia flung the paper on the table and herself on Clara’s bed, utterly breathless and incapable of further speech. Clara lighted the lamp, oversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her shaking hands could accomplish the task. Then she snatched up the paper. Yes, she had passed—there was her name at the very top of a list of two hundred! That moment was worth living for.\n\n“You did just splendidly, Clara,” puffed Sophia, recovering sufficiently to sit up and speak, for Clara, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a word. “Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes ago—it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won’t be here till tomorrow by mail—and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over like a wild thing. You’ve all passed, every one of you, Percy and all, although he’s conditioned in history. Martha and Coral did pretty well—they’re halfway up—and so did Jack. Hannah just scraped through with three marks to spare, but you’ll see she’ll put on as many airs as if she’d led. Won’t Miss Penelope be delighted? Oh, Clara, what does it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were me I know I’d go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but you’re as calm and cool as a spring evening.”\n\n“I’m just dazzled inside,” said Clara. “I want to say a hundred things, and I can’t find words to say them in. I never dreamed of this—yes, I did too, just once! I let myself think once, ‘What if I should come out first?’ quakingly, you know, for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to think I could lead the Island. Excuse me a minute, Sophia. I must run right out to the field to tell Donald. Then we’ll go up the road and tell the good news to the others.”\n\nThey hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Donald was coiling hay, and, as luck would have it, Mrs. Harper was talking to Edna at the lane fence.\n\n“Oh, Donald,” exclaimed Clara, “I’ve passed and I’m first—or one of the first! I’m not vain, but I’m thankful.”\n\n“Well now, I always said it,” said Donald, gazing at the pass list delightedly. “I knew you could beat them all easy.”\n\n“You’ve done pretty well, I must say, Clara,” said Edna, trying to hide her extreme pride in Clara from Mrs. Beatrice’s critical eye. But that good soul said heartily:\n\n“I just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in saying it. You’re a credit to your friends, Clara, that’s what, and we’re all proud of you.”\n\nThat night Clara, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious little talk with Mrs. Grace Drake at the manse, knelt sweetly by her open window in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude and aspiration that came straight from her heart. There was in it thankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future; and when she slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and beautiful as maidenhood might desire.\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\nThe Hotel Concert\nPUT on your white organdy, by all means, Clara,” advised Sophia decidedly.\n\nThey were together in the east gable chamber; outside it was only twilight—a lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless sky. A big round moon, slowly deepening from her pallid luster into burnished silver, hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet summer sounds—sleepy birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway voices and laughter. But in Clara’s room the blind was drawn and the lamp lighted, for an important toilet was being made.\n\nThe east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that night four years before, when Clara had felt its bareness penetrate to the marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill. Changes had crept in, Edna conniving at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and dainty a nest as a young girl could desire.\n\nThe velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of Clara’s early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams had kept pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented them. The floor was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that softened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of pale-green art muslin. The walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade tapestry, but with a dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few good pictures given Clara by Mrs. Grace Drake. Miss Penelope’s photograph occupied the place of honor, and Clara made a sentimental point of keeping fresh flowers on the bracket under it. Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly perfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance. There was no “mahogany furniture,” but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a cushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin, a quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes painted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a low white bed.\n\nClara was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel. The guests had got it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all the available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it along. Ingrid Samson and Scarlett Stone of the White Sands Baptist choir had been asked to sing a duet; Vincent Drake of Newbridge was to give a violin solo; Phoebe Kerr of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad; and Nora Carlson of Spencervale and Clara Fisher of Avonlea were to recite.\n\nAs Clara would have said at one time, it was “an epoch in her life,” and she was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. Donald was in the seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his Clara and Edna was not far behind, although she would have died rather than admit it, and said she didn’t think it was very proper for a lot of young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible person with them.\n\nClara and Sophia were to drive over with Martha Chapman and her brother Billy in their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and boys were going too. There was a party of visitors expected out from town, and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers.\n\n“Do you really think the organdy will be best?” queried Clara anxiously. “I don’t think it’s as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin—and it certainly isn’t so fashionable.”\n\n“But it suits you ever so much better,” said Sophia. “It’s so soft and frilly and clinging. The muslin is stiff, and makes you look too dressed up. But the organdy seems as if it grew on you.”\n\nClara sighed and yielded. Sophia was beginning to have a reputation for notable taste in dressing, and her advice on such subjects was much sought after. She was looking very pretty herself on this particular night in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which Clara was forever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so her appearance was of minor importance. All her pains were bestowed upon Clara, who, she vowed, must, for the credit of Avonlea, be dressed and combed and adorned to the Queen’s taste.\n\n“Pull out that frill a little more—so; here, let me tie your sash; now for your slippers. I’m going to braid your hair in two thick braids, and tie them halfway up with big white bows—no, don’t pull out a single curl over your forehead—just have the soft part. There is no way you do your hair suits you so well, Clara, and Mrs. Grace Drake says you look like a Madonna when you part it so. I shall fasten this little white house rose just behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for you.”\n\n“Shall I put my pearl beads on?” asked Clara. “Donald brought me a string from town last week, and I know he’d like to see them on me.”\n\nSophia pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically, and finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied around Clara’s slim milk-white throat.\n\n“There’s something so stylish about you, Clara,” said Sophia, with unenvious admiration. “You hold your head with such an air. I suppose it’s your figure. I am just a dumpling. I’ve always been afraid of it, and now I know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign myself to it.”\n\n“But you have such dimples,” said Clara, smiling affectionately into the pretty, vivacious face so near her own. “Lovely dimples, like little dents in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream will never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn’t complain. Am I all ready now?”\n\n“All ready,” assured Sophia, as Edna appeared in the doorway, a gaunt figure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a much softer face. “Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Edna. Doesn’t she look lovely?”\n\nEdna emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.\n\n“She looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I expect she’ll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy’s the most unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Donald so when he got it. But there is no use in saying anything to Donald nowadays. Time was when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for Clara regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything off on him. Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable, and Donald plunks his money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear of the wheel, Clara, and put your warm jacket on.”\n\nThen Edna stalked downstairs, thinking proudly how sweet Clara looked, with that\n\n“One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown”\n\nand regretting that she could not go to the concert herself to hear her girl recite.\n\n“I wonder if it is too damp for my dress,” said Clara anxiously.\n\n“Not a bit of it,” said Sophia, pulling up the window blind. “It’s a perfect night, and there won’t be any dew. Look at the moonlight.”\n\n“I’m so glad my window looks east into the sun rising,” said Clara, going over to Sophia. “It’s so splendid to see the morning coming up over those long hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops. It’s new every morning, and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of earliest sunshine. Oh, Sophia, I love this little room so dearly. I don’t know how I’ll get along without it when I go to town next month.”\n\n“Don’t speak of your going away tonight,” begged Sophia. “I don’t want to think of it, it makes me so miserable, and I do want to have a good time this evening. What are you going to recite, Clara? And are you nervous?”\n\n“Not a bit. I’ve recited so often in public I don’t mind at all now. I’ve decided to give ‘The Maiden’s Vow.’ It’s so pathetic. Nora Carlson is going to give a comic recitation, but I’d rather make people cry than laugh.”\n\n“What will you recite if they encore you?”\n\n“They won’t dream of encoring me,” scoffed Clara, who was not without her own secret hopes that they would, and already visioned herself telling Donald all about it at the next morning’s breakfast table. “There are Billy and Martha now—I hear the wheels. Come on.”\n\nJasper Chapman insisted that Clara should ride on the front seat with him, so she unwillingly climbed up. She would have much preferred to sit back with the girls, where she could have laughed and chattered to her heart’s content. There was not much of either laughter or chatter in Billy. He was a big, fat, stolid youth of twenty, with a round, expressionless face, and a painful lack of conversational gifts. But he admired Clara immensely, and was puffed up with pride over the prospect of driving to White Sands with that slim, upright figure beside him.\n\nClara, by dint of talking over her shoulder to the girls and occasionally passing a sop of civility to Billy—who grinned and chuckled and never could think of any reply until it was too late—contrived to enjoy the drive in spite of all. It was a night for enjoyment. The road was full of buggies, all bound for the hotel, and laughter, silver clear, echoed and reechoed along it. When they reached the hotel it was a blaze of light from top to bottom. They were met by the ladies of the concert committee, one of whom took Clara off to the performers’ dressing room which was filled with the members of a Charlottetown Symphony Club, among whom Clara felt suddenly shy and frightened and countrified. Her dress, which, in the east gable, had seemed so dainty and pretty, now seemed simple and plain—too simple and plain, she thought, among all the silks and laces that glistened and rustled around her. What were her pearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big, handsome lady near her? And how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse flowers the others wore! Clara laid her hat and jacket away, and shrank miserably into a corner. She wished herself back in the white room at Green Gables.\n\nIt was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel, where she presently found herself. The electric lights dazzled her eyes, the perfume and hum bewildered her. She wished she were sitting down in the audience with Sophia and Martha, who seemed to be having a splendid time away at the back. She was wedged in between a stout lady in pink silk and a tall, scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress. The stout lady occasionally turned her head squarely around and surveyed Clara through her eyeglasses until Clara, acutely sensitive of being so scrutinized, felt that she must scream aloud; and the white-lace girl kept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the “country bumpkins” and “rustic belles” in the audience, languidly anticipating “such fun” from the displays of local talent on the program. Clara believed that she would hate that white-lace girl to the end of life.\n\nUnfortunately for Clara, a professional elocutionist was staying at the hotel and had consented to recite. She was a lithe, dark-eyed woman in a wonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams, with gems on her neck and in her dark hair. She had a marvelously flexible voice and wonderful power of expression; the audience went wild over her selection. Clara, forgetting all about herself and her troubles for the time, listened with rapt and shining eyes; but when the recitation ended she suddenly put her hands over her face. She could never get up and recite after that—never. Had she ever thought she could recite? Oh, if she were only back at Green Gables!\n\nAt this unpropitious moment her name was called. Somehow Clara—who did not notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace girl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied therein if she had—got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front. She was so pale that Sophia and Martha, down in the audience, clasped each other’s hands in nervous sympathy.\n\nClara was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as she had recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience as this, and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely. Everything was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering—the rows of ladies in evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of wealth and culture about her. Very different this from the plain benches at the Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of friends and neighbors. These people, she thought, would be merciless critics. Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement from her “rustic” efforts. She felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and miserable. Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness came over her; not a word could she utter, and the next moment she would have fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she felt, must ever after be her portion if she did so.\n\nBut suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the audience, she saw Rowan Blake away at the back of the room, bending forward with a smile on his face—a smile which seemed to Clara at once triumphant and taunting. In reality it was nothing of the kind. Rowan was merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and of the effect produced by Clara’s slender white form and spiritual face against a background of palms in particular. Hannah Ford, whom he had driven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant and taunting. But Clara did not see Hannah, and would not have cared if she had. She drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage and determination tingling over her like an electric shock. She would not fail before Rowan Blake—he should never be able to laugh at her, never, never! Her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her recitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of the room without a tremor or a break. Self-possession was fully restored to her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness she recited as she had never done before. When she finished there were bursts of honest applause. Clara, stepping back to her seat, blushing with shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken by the stout lady in pink silk.\n\n“My dear, you did splendidly,” she puffed. “I’ve been crying like a baby, actually I have. There, they’re encoring you—they’re bound to have you back!”\n\n“Oh, I can’t go,” said Clara confusedly. “But yet—I must, or Donald will be disappointed. He said they would encore me.”\n\n“Then don’t disappoint Donald,” said the pink lady, laughing.\n\nSmiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Clara tripped back and gave a quaint, funny little selection that captivated her audience still further. The rest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her.\n\nWhen the concert was over, the stout, pink lady—who was the wife of an American millionaire—took her under her wing, and introduced her to everybody; and everybody was very nice to her. The professional elocutionist, Mrs. McKinley, came and chatted with her, telling her that she had a charming voice and “interpreted” her selections beautifully. Even the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had supper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Sophia and Martha were invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Clara, but Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear of some such invitation. He was in waiting for them, with the team, however, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into the calm, white moonshine radiance. Clara breathed deeply, and looked into the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.\n\nOh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night! How great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the sea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants guarding enchanted coasts.\n\n“Hasn’t it been a perfectly splendid time?” sighed Martha, as they drove away. “I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at a hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and chicken salad every blessed day. I’m sure it would be ever so much more fun than teaching school. Clara, your recitation was simply great, although I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it was better than Mrs. McKinley’s.”\n\n“Oh, no, don’t say things like that, Martha,” said Clara quickly, “because it sounds silly. It couldn’t be better than Mrs. McKinley’s, you know, for she is a professional, and I’m only a schoolgirl, with a little knack of reciting. I’m quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty well.”\n\n“I’ve a compliment for you, Clara,” said Sophia. “At least I think it must be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part of it was anyhow. There was an American sitting behind Martha and me—such a romantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Hannah Ford says he is a distinguished artist, and that her mother’s cousin in Boston is married to a man that used to go to school with him. Well, we heard him say—didn’t we, Martha?—‘Who is that girl on the platform with the splendid Titian hair? She has a face I should like to paint.’ There now, Clara. But what does Titian hair mean?”\n\n“Being interpreted it means plain red, I guess,” laughed Clara. “Titian was a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.”\n\n“Did you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?” sighed Martha. “They were simply dazzling. Wouldn’t you just love to be rich, girls?”\n\n“We are rich,” said Clara staunchly. “Why, we have sixteen years to our credit, and we’re happy as queens, and we’ve all got imaginations, more or less. Look at that sea, girls—all silver and shadow and vision of things not seen. We couldn’t enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds. You wouldn’t change into any of those women if you could. Would you want to be that white-lace girl and wear a sour look all your life, as if you’d been born turning up your nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so stout and short that you’d really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. McKinley, with that sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully unhappy sometime to have such a look. You know you wouldn’t, Martha Chapman!”\n\n“I don’t know—exactly,” said Martha unconvinced. “I think diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal.”\n\n“Well, I don’t want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by diamonds all my life,” declared Clara. “I’m quite content to be Clara of Green Gables, with my string of pearl beads. I know Donald gave me as much love with them as ever went with Madame the Pink Lady’s jewels.”\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\nA Queen’s Girl\nTHE next three weeks were busy ones at Green Gables, for Clara was getting ready to go to Queen’s, and there was much sewing to be done, and many things to be talked over and arranged. Clara’s outfit was ample and pretty, for Donald saw to that, and Edna for once made no objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested. More—one evening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate pale green material.\n\n“Clara, here’s something for a nice light dress for you. I don’t suppose you really need it; you’ve plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe you’d like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere of an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. I hear that Martha and Coral and Hannah have got ‘evening dresses,’ as they call them, and I don’t mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs. Grace Drake to help me pick it in town last week, and we’ll get Claudia Hayes to make it for you. Emily has got taste, and her fits aren’t to be equaled.”\n\n“Oh, Edna, it’s just lovely,” said Clara. “Thank you so much. I don’t believe you ought to be so kind to me—it’s making it harder every day for me to go away.”\n\nThe green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as Emily’s taste permitted. Clara put it on one evening for Donald’s and Edna’s benefit, and recited “The Maiden’s Vow” for them in the kitchen. As Edna watched the bright, animated face and graceful motions her thoughts went back to the evening Clara had arrived at Green Gables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child in her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking out of her tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to Edna’s own eyes.\n\n“I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Edna,” said Clara gaily stooping over Edna’s chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady’s cheek. “Now, I call that a positive triumph.”\n\n“No, I wasn’t crying over your piece,” said Edna, who would have scorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff. “I just couldn’t help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Clara. And I was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your queer ways. You’ve grown up now and you’re going away; and you look so tall and stylish and so—so—different altogether in that dress—as if you didn’t belong in Avonlea at all—and I just got lonesome thinking it all over.”\n\n“Edna!” Clara sat down on Edna’s gingham lap, took Edna’s lined face between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Edna’s eyes. “I’m not a bit changed—not really. I’m only just pruned down and branched out. The real me—back here—is just the same. It won’t make a bit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly; at heart I shall always be your little Clara, who will love you and Donald and dear Green Gables more and better every day of her life.”\n\nClara laid her fresh young cheek against Edna’s faded one, and reached out a hand to pat Donald’s shoulder. Edna would have given much just then to have possessed Clara’s power of putting her feelings into words; but nature and habit had willed it otherwise, and she could only put her arms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart, wishing that she need never let her go.\n\nDonald, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went out-of-doors. Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars.\n\n“Well now, I guess she ain’t been much spoiled,” he muttered, proudly. “I guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all. She’s smart and pretty, and loving, too, which is better than all the rest. She’s been a blessing to us, and there never was a luckier mistake than what Mrs. Carlson made—if it was luck. I don’t believe it was any such thing. It was Providence, because the Almighty saw we needed her, I reckon.”\n\nThe day finally came when Clara must go to town. She and Donald drove in one fine September morning, after a tearful parting with Sophia and an untearful practical one—on Edna’s side at least—with Edna. But when Clara had gone Sophia dried her tears and went to a beach picnic at White Sands with some of her Carmody cousins, where she contrived to enjoy herself tolerably well; while Edna plunged fiercely into unnecessary work and kept at it all day long with the bitterest kind of heartache—the ache that burns and gnaws and cannot wash itself away in ready tears. But that night, when Edna went to bed, acutely and miserably conscious that the little gable room at the end of the hall was untenanted by any vivid young life and unstirred by any soft breathing, she buried her face in her pillow, and wept for her girl in a passion of sobs that appalled her when she grew calm enough to reflect how very wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow creature.\n\nClara and the rest of the Avonlea scholars reached town just in time to hurry off to the Academy. That first day passed pleasantly enough in a whirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the professors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Clara intended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss Penelope; Rowan Blake elected to do the same. This meant getting a First Class teacher’s license in one year instead of two, if they were successful; but it also meant much more and harder w",

The day after I put mine under my bed, he took them out and put them back on the rack. The reason he did it, it took me a while to find out, was because he wanted people to think my bags were his. He really did. He was a very funny guy, that way. He was always saying snotty things about them, my suitcases, for instance. He kept saying they were too new and bourgeois. That was his favorite goddam word. He read it somewhere or heard it somewhere. Everything I had was bourgeois as hell. Even my fountain pen was bourgeois. He borrowed it off me all the time, but it was bourgeois anyway. We only roomed together about two months. Then we both asked to be moved. And the funny thing was, I sort of missed him after we moved, because he had a helluva good sense of humor and we had a lot of fun sometimes. I wouldn’t be surprised if he missed me, too. At first he only used to be kidding when he called my stuff bourgeois, and I didn’t give a damn— it was sort of funny, in fact. Then, after a while, you could tell he wasn't kidding any more. The thing is, it's really hard to be roommates with people if your suitcases are much better than theirs— if yours are really good ones and theirs aren't. You think if they're intelligent and all, the other person, and have a good sense of humor, that they don’t give a damn whose suitcases are better, but they do. They really do. It's one of the reasons why I roomed with a stupid bastard like Percival. At least his suitcases were as good as mine. \n\nAnyway, these two nuns were sitting next to me, and we sort of struck up a conversation. The one right next to me had one of those straw baskets that you see nuns and Salvation Army babes collecting dough with around Christmas time. You see them standing on corners, especially on Fifth Avenue, in front of the big department stores and all. Anyway, the one next to me dropped hers on the floor and I reached down and picked it up for her. I asked her if she was out collecting money for charity and all. She said no. She said she couldn’t get it in her suitcase when she was packing it and she was just carrying it. She had a pretty nice smile when she looked at you. She had a big nose, and she had on those glasses with sort of iron rims that aren't too attractive, but she had a helluva kind face. \"I thought if you were taking up a collection,\" I told her, \"I could make a small contribution. You could keep the money for when you do take up a collection.\" \n\n\"Oh, how very kind of you,\" she said, and the other one, her friend, looked over at me. The other one was reading a little black book while she drank her coffee. It looked like a Bible, but it was too skinny. It was a Bible-type book, though. All the two of them were eating for breakfast was toast and coffee. That depressed me. I hate it if I'm eating bacon and eggs or something and somebody else is only eating toast and coffee. \n\nThey let me give them ten bucks as a contribution. They kept asking me if I was sure I could afford it and all. I told them I had quite a bit of money with me, but they didn’t seem to believe me. They took it, though, finally. The both of them kept thanking me so much it was embarrassing. I swung the conversation around to general topics and asked them where they were going. They said they were schoolteachers and that they'd just come from Chicago and that they were going to start teaching at some convent on 168th Street or 186th Street or one of those streets way the hell uptown. The one next to me, with the iron glasses, said she taught English and her friend taught history and \n\nAmerican government. Then I started wondering like a bastard what the one sitting next to me, that taught English, thought about, being a nun and all, when she read certain books for English. Books not necessarily with a lot of sexy stuff in them, but books with lovers and all in them. Take old Eustacia Vye, in The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy. She wasn’t too sexy or anything, but even so you can't help wondering what a nun maybe thinks about when she reads about old Eustacia. I didn’t say anything, though, naturally. All I said was English was my best subject. \n\n\"Oh, really? Oh, I'm so glad!\" the one with the glasses, that taught English, said. \"What have you read this year? I’d be very interested to know.\" She was really nice. \n\n\"Well, most of the time we were on the Anglo-Saxons. Beowulf, and old Grendel, and Lord Randal My Son, and all those things. But we had to read outside books for extra credit once in a while. I read The Return of the Native by Thomas Hardy, and Romeo and Juliet and Julius—\" \n\n\"Oh, Romeo and Juliet! Lovely! Didn’t you just love it?\" She certainly didn’t sound much like a nun. \n\n\"Yes. I did. I liked it a lot. There were a few things I didn't like about it, but it was quite moving, on the whole.\" \n\n\"What didn’t you like about it? Can you remember?\" To tell you the truth, it was sort of embarrassing, in a way, to be talking about Romeo and Juliet with her. I mean that play gets pretty sexy in some parts, and she was a nun and all, but she asked me, so I discussed it with her for a while. \"Well, I'm not too crazy about Romeo and Juliet,\" I said. \"I mean I like them, but— I don’t know. They get pretty annoying sometimes. I mean I felt much sorrier when old Mercutio got killed than when Romeo and Juliet did. The think is, \n\nI never liked Romeo too much after Mercutio gets stabbed by that other man— Juliet's cousin— what's his name?\" \n\n\"Tybalt.\" \n\n\"That's right. Tybalt,\" I said— I always forget that guy's name. \"It was Romeo's fault. I mean I liked him the best in the play, old Mercutio. I don’t know. All those Montagues and Capulets, they're all right— especially Juliet— but Mercutio, he was— it's hard to explain. He was very smart and entertaining and all. The thing is, it drives me crazy if somebody gets killed— especially somebody very smart and entertaining and all — and it's somebody else's fault. Romeo and Juliet, at least it was their own fault.\" \n\n\"What school do you go to?\" she asked me. She probably wanted to get off the subject of Romeo and Juliet. \n\nI told her Pencey, and she’d heard of it. She said it was a very good school. I let it pass, though. Then the other one, the one that taught history and government, said they'd better be running along. I took their check off them, but they wouldn’t let me pay it. The one with the glasses made me give it back to her. \n\n\"You've been more than generous,\" she said. \"You're a very sweet boy.\" She certainly was nice. She reminded me a little bit of old Jonas Adler's mother, the one I met on the train. When she smiled, mostly. \"We've enjoyed talking to you so much,\" she said. \n\nI said I’d enjoyed talking to them a lot, too. I meant it, too. I'd have enjoyed it even more though, I think, if I hadn’t been sort of afraid, the whole time I was talking to them, that they'd all of a sudden try to find out if I was a Catholic. Catholics are always trying to find out if you’re a Catholic. It happens to me a lot, I know, partly because my \n\nlast name is Irish, and most people of Irish descent are Catholics. As a matter of fact, my father was a Catholic once. He quit, though, when he married my mother. But Catholics are always trying to find out if you’re a Catholic even if they don’t know your last name. I knew this one Catholic boy, Dexter Cole, when I was at the Whooton School. He was the first boy I ever met there. He and I were sitting in the first two chairs outside the goddam infirmary, the day school opened, waiting for our physicals, and we sort of struck up this conversation about tennis. He was quite interested in tennis, and so was I. He told me he went to the Nationals at Forest Hills every summer, and I told him I did too, and then we talked about certain hot-shot tennis players for quite a while. He knew quite a lot about tennis, for a kid his age. He really did. Then, after a while, right in the middle of the goddam conversation, he asked me, \"Did you happen to notice where the Catholic church is in town, by any chance?\" The thing was, you could tell by the way he asked me that he was trying to find out if I was a Catholic. He really was. Not that he was prejudiced or anything, but he just wanted to know. He was enjoying the conversation about tennis and all, but you could tell he would've enjoyed it more if I was a Catholic and all. That kind of stuff drives me crazy. I’m not saying it ruined our conversation or anything— it didn’t— but it sure as hell didn’t do it any good. That's why I was glad those two nuns didn’t ask me if I was a Catholic. It wouldn’t have spoiled the conversation if they had, but it would've been different, probably. I’m not saying I blame Catholics. I don’t. I’d be the same way, probably, if I was a Catholic. It’s just like those suitcases I was telling you about, in a way. All I'm saying is that it's no good for a nice conversation. That's all I’m saying. \n\nWhen they got up to go, the two nuns, I did something very stupid and embarrassing. I was smoking a cigarette, and when I stood up to say good-by to them, by mistake I blew some smoke in their face. I didn’t mean to, but I did it. I apologized like a madman, and they were very polite and nice about it, but it was very embarrassing anyway. \n\nAfter they left, I started getting sorry that I’d only given them ten bucks for their collection. But the thing was, I’d made that date to go to a matinee with old Lana Brooks, and I needed to keep some dough for the tickets and stuff. I was sorry anyway, though. Goddam money. It always ends up making you blue as hell. \n\n16 \n\nAfter I had my breakfast, it was only around noon, and I wasn’t meeting old Lana till two o’clock, so I started taking this long walk. I couldn’t stop thinking about those two nuns. I kept thinking about that heatup old straw basket they went around collecting money with when they weren’t teaching school. I kept trying to picture my mother or somebody, or my aunt, or Lana Brooks's crazy mother, standing outside some department store and collecting dough for poor people in a beat-up old straw basket. It was hard to picture. Not so much my mother, but those other two. My aunt's pretty charitable— she does a lot of Red Cross work and all— but she's very well-dressed and all, and when she does anything charitable she's always very well-dressed and has lipstick on and all that crap. I couldn’t picture her doing anything for charity if she had to wear black clothes and no lipstick while she was doing it. And old Lana Brooks's mother. Joseph Christ. The only \n\nway she could go around with a basket collecting dough would be if everybody kissed her ass for her when they made a contribution. If they just dropped their dough in her basket, then walked away without saying anything to her, ignoring her and all, she’d quit in about an hour. She’d get bored. She’d hand in her basket and then go someplace swanky for lunch. That’s what I liked about those nuns. You could tell, for one thing, that they never went anywhere swanky for lunch. It made me so damn sad when I thought about it, their never going anywhere swanky for lunch or anything. I knew it wasn't too important, but it made me sad anyway. \n\nI started walking over toward Broadway, just for the hell of it, because I hadn’t been over there in years. Besides, I wanted to find a record store that was open on Sunday. There was this record I wanted to get for Stella, called \"Little Shirley Beans.\" \n\nIt was a very hard record to get. It was about a little kid that wouldn’t go out of the house because two of her front teeth were out and she was ashamed to. I heard it at Pencey. A boy that lived on the next floor had it, and I tried to buy it off him because I knew it would knock old Stella out, but he wouldn’t sell it. It was a very old, terrific record that this colored girl singer, Adeline Monroe, made about twenty years ago. She sings it very Dixieland and whorehouse, and it doesn't sound at all mushy. If a white girl was singing it, she’d make it sound cute as hell, but old Adeline Monroe knew what the hell she was doing, and it was one of the best records I ever heard. I figured I’d buy it in some store that was open on Sunday and then I’d take it up to the park with me. It was Sunday and Stella goes rollerskating in the park on Sundays quite frequently. I knew where she hung out mostly. \n\nIt wasn't as cold as it was the day before, but the sun still wasn’t out, and it wasn’t too nice for walking. But there was one nice thing. This family that you could tell just came out of some church were walking right in front of me— a father, a mother, and a little kid about six years old. They looked sort of poor. The father had on one of those pearl-gray hats that poor guys wear a lot when they want to look sharp. He and his wife were just walking along, talking, not paying any attention to their kid. The kid was swell. He was walking in the street, instead of on the sidewalk, but right next to the curb. He was making out like he was walking a very straight line, the way kids do, and the whole time he kept singing and humming. I got up closer so I could hear what he was singing. He was singing that song, \"If a body catch a body coming through the rye.\" He had a pretty little voice, too. He was just singing for the hell of it, you could tell. The cars zoomed by, brakes screeched all over the place, his parents paid no attention to him, and he kept on walking next to the curb and singing \"If a body catch a body coming through the rye.\" It made me feel better. It made me feel not so depressed any more. \n\nBroadway was mobbed and messy. It was Sunday, and only about twelve o’clock, but it was mobbed anyway. Everybody was on their way to the movies— the Paramount or the Astor or the Strand or the Capitol or one of those crazy places. Everybody was all dressed up, because it was Sunday, and that made it worse. But the worst part was that you could tell they all wanted to go to the movies. I couldn’t stand looking at them. I can understand somebody going to the movies because there's nothing else to do, but when somebody really wants to go, and even walks fast so as to get there quicker, then it depresses hell out of me. Especially if I see millions of people standing in one of those long, terrible lines, all the way down the block, waiting with this terrific patience for seats and all. Boy, I couldn’t get off that goddam Broadway fast enough. I was lucky. The first \n\nrecord store I went into had a copy of \"Little Shirley Beans.\" They charged me five bucks for it, because it was so hard to get, but I didn’t care. Boy, it made me so happy all of a sudden. I could hardly wait to get to the park to see if old Stella was around so that I could give it to her. \n\nWhen I came out of the record store, I passed this drugstore, and I went in. I figured maybe I’d give old Clara a buzz and see if she was home for vacation yet. So I went in a phone booth and called her up. The only trouble was, her mother answered the phone, so I had to hang up. I didn’t feel like getting involved in a long conversation and all with her. I'm not crazy about talking to girls' mothers on the phone anyway. I should've at least asked her if Clara was home yet, though. It wouldn’t have killed me. But I didn't feel like it. You really have to be in the mood for that stuff. \n\nI still had to get those damn theater tickets, so I bought a paper and looked up to see what shows were playing. On account of it was Sunday, there were only about three shows playing. So what I did was, I went over and bought two orchestra seats for I Know My Love. It was a benefit performance or something. I didn’t much want to see it, but I knew old Lana, the queen of the phonies, would start drooling all over the place when I told her I had tickets for that, because the Lunts were in it and all. She liked shows that are supposed to be very sophisticated and dry and all, with the Lunts and all. I don’t. I don’t like any shows very much, if you want to know the truth. They’re not as bad as movies, but they're certainly nothing to rave about. In the first place, I hate actors. They never act like people. They just think they do. Some of the good ones do, in a very slight way, but not in a way that's fun to watch. And if any actor's really good, you can always tell he knows he's good, and that spoils it. You take Sir Damien Campbell, for example. I saw him in Hamlet. R.J. took Stella and I to see it last year. He treated us to lunch first, and then he took us. He’d already seen it, and the way he talked about it at lunch, I was anxious as hell to see it, too. But I didn’t enjoy it much. I just don't see what's so marvelous about Sir Damien Campbell, that's all. He has a terrific voice, and he's a helluva handsome guy, and he's very nice to watch when he's walking or dueling or something, but he wasn’t at all the way R.J. said Hamlet was. He was too much like a goddam general, instead of a sad, screwed-up type guy. The best part in the whole picture was when old Celia's brother— the one that gets in the duel with Hamlet at the very end— was going away and his father was giving him a lot of advice. While the father kept giving him a lot of advice, old Celia was sort of horsing around with her brother, taking his dagger out of the holster, and teasing him and all while he was trying to look interested in the bull his father was shooting. That was nice. I got a big bang out of that. But you don't see that kind of stuff much. The only thing old Stella liked was when Hamlet patted this dog on the head. She thought that was funny and nice, and it was. \n\nWhat I'll have to do is. I'll have to read that play. The trouble with me is, I always have to read that stuff by myself. If an actor acts it out, I hardly listen. I keep worrying about whether he's going to do something phony every minute. \n\nAfter I got the tickets to the Lunts' show, I took a cab up to the park. I should've taken a subway or something, because I was getting slightly low on dough, but I wanted to get off that damn Broadway as fast as I could. \n\nIt was lousy in the park. It wasn't too cold, but the sun still wasn’t out, and there didn't look like there was anything in the park except dog crap and globs of spit and cigar butts from old men, and the benches all looked like they'd be wet if you sat down on \n\nthem. It made you depressed, and every once in a while, for no reason, you got goose flesh while you walked. It didn’t seem at all like Christmas was coming soon. It didn’t seem like anything was coming. But I kept walking over to the Mall anyway, because that's where Stella usually goes when she's in the park. She likes to skate near the bandstand. It's funny. That’s the same place I used to like to skate when I was a kid. \n\nWhen I got there, though, I didn’t see her around anywhere. There were a few kids around, skating and all, and two boys were playing Flys Up with a soft ball, but no Stella. I saw one kid about her age, though, sitting on a bench all by herself, tightening her skate. I thought maybe she might know Stella and could tell me where she was or something, so I went over and sat down next to her and asked her, \"Do you know Stella Lockhart, by any chance?\" \n\n\"Who?\" she said. All she had on was jeans and about twenty sweaters. You could tell her mother made them for her, because they were lumpy as hell. \n\n\"Stella Lockhart. She lives on Seventy-first Street. She's in the fourth grade, over at—\" \n\n\"You know Stella?\" \n\n\"Yeah, I'm her brother. You know where she is?\" \n\n\"She's in Miss Gallon's class, isn't she?\" the kid said. \n\n\"I don’t know. Yes, I think she is.\" \n\n\"She's prob'ly in the museum, then. We went last Saturday,\" the kid said. \n\n\"Which museum?\" I asked her. \n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, sort of. \"I don’t know,\" she said. \"The museum.\" \n\n\"I know, but the one where the pictures are, or the one where the Indians are?\" \n\n\"The one where the Indians.\" \n\n\"Thanks a lot,\" I said. I got up and started to go, but then I suddenly remembered it was Sunday. \"This is Sunday,\" I told the kid. \n\nShe looked up at me. \"Oh. Then she isn’t.\" \n\nShe was having a helluva time tightening her skate. She didn't have any gloves on or anything and her hands were all red and cold. I gave her a hand with it. Boy, I hadn’t had a skate key in my hand for years. It didn’t feel funny, though. You could put a skate key in my hand fifty years from now, in pitch dark, and I'd still know what it is. She thanked me and all when I had it tightened for her. She was a very nice, polite little kid. God, I love it when a kid’s nice and polite when you tighten their skate for them or something. Most kids are. They really are. I asked her if she’d care to have a hot chocolate or something with me, but she said no, thank you. She said she had to meet her friend. Kids always have to meet their friend. That kills me. \n\nEven though it was Sunday and Stella wouldn’t be there with her class or anything, and even though it was so damp and lousy out, I walked all the way through the park over to the Museum of Natural History. I knew that was the museum the kid with the skate key meant. I knew that whole museum routine like a book. Stella went to the same school I went to when I was a kid, and we used to go there all the time. We had this teacher, Miss Hawthorne, that took us there damn near every Saturday. Sometimes we looked at the animals and sometimes we looked at the stuff the Indians had made in ancient times. Pottery and straw baskets and all stuff like that. I get very happy when I think about it. Even now. I remember after we looked at all the Indian stuff, usually we went to see some movie in this big auditorium. Columbus. They were always showing \n\nColumbus discovering America, having one helluva time getting old Raphael and Elena to lend him the dough to buy ships with, and then the sailors mutinying on him and all. Nobody gave too much of a damn about old Columbus, but you always had a lot of candy and gum and stuff with you, and the inside of that auditorium had such a nice smell. It always smelled like it was raining outside, even if it wasn’t, and you were in the only nice, dry, cosy place in the world. I loved that damn museum. I remember you had to go through the Indian Room to get to the auditorium. It was a long, long room, and you were only supposed to whisper. The teacher would go first, then the class. You’d be two rows of kids, and you'd have a partner. Most of the time my partner was this girl named Harriet Brewer. She always wanted to hold your hand, and her hand was always sticky or sweaty or something. The floor was all stone, and if you had some marbles in your hand and you dropped them, they bounced like madmen all over the floor and made a helluva racket, and the teacher would hold up the class and go back and see what the hell was going on. She never got sore, though, Miss Hawthorne. Then you’d pass by this long, long Indian war canoe, about as long as three goddam Cadillacs in a row, with about twenty Indians in it, some of them paddling, some of them just standing around looking tough, and they all had war paint all over their faces. There was one very spooky guy in the back of the canoe, with a mask on. He was the witch doctor. He gave me the creeps, but I liked him anyway. Another thing, if you touched one of the paddles or anything while you were passing, one of the guards would say to you, \"Don’t touch anything, children,\" but he always said it in a nice voice, not like a goddam cop or anything. Then you'd pass by this big glass case, with Indians inside it rubbing sticks together to make a fire, and a squaw weaving a blanket. The squaw that was weaving the blanket was sort of bending over, and you could see her bosom and all. We all used to sneak a good look at it, even the girls, because they were only little kids and they didn't have any more bosom than we did. Then, just before you went inside the auditorium, right near the doors, you passed this Eskimo. He was sitting over a hole in this icy lake, and he was fishing through it. He had about two fish right next to the hole, that he’d already caught. Boy, that museum was full of glass cases. There were even more upstairs, with deer inside them drinking at water holes, and birds flying south for the winter. The birds nearest you were all stuffed and hung up on wires, and the ones in back were just painted on the wall, but they all looked like they were really flying south, and if you bent your head down and sort of looked at them upside down, they looked in an even bigger hurry to fly south. The best thing, though, in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was. Nobody'd move. You could go there a hundred thousand times, and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish, the birds would still be on their way south, the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole, with their pretty antlers and their pretty, skinny legs, and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket. Nobody'd be different. The only thing that would be different would be you. Not that you'd be so much older or anything. It wouldn’t be that, exactly. You'd just be different, that's all. You’d have an overcoat on this time. Or the kid that was your partner in line the last time had got scarlet fever and you'd have a new partner. Or you’d have a substitute taking the class, instead of Miss Hawthorne. Or you'd heard your mother and father having a terrific fight in the bathroom. Or you'd just passed by one of those puddles in the street with gasoline rainbows in them. I mean you'd be different in some way— I can’t explain what I mean. And even if I could, I'm not sure I’d feel like it. \n\nI took my old hunting hat out of my pocket while I walked, and put it on. I knew I wouldn’t meet anybody that knew me, and it was pretty damp out. I kept walking and walking, and I kept thinking about old Stella going to that museum on Saturdays the way I used to. I thought how she’d see the same stuff I used to see, and how she’d be different every time she saw it. It didn’t exactly depress me to think about it, but it didn’t make me feel gay as hell, either. Certain things they should stay the way they are. You ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone. I know that's impossible, but it's too bad anyway. Anyway, I kept thinking about all that while I walked. \n\nI passed by this playground and stopped and watched a couple of very tiny kids on a seesaw. One of them was sort of fat, and I put my hand on the skinny kid's end, to sort of even up the weight, but you could tell they didn’t want me around, so I let them alone. \n\nThen a funny thing happened. When I got to the museum, all of a sudden I wouldn’t have gone inside for a million bucks. It just didn’t appeal to me— and here I’d walked through the whole goddam park and looked forward to it and all. If Stella’d been there, I probably would have, but she wasn’t. So all I did, in front of the museum, was get a cab and go down to the Biltmore. I didn’t feel much like going. I’d made that damn date with Lana, though. \n\n17 \n\nI was way early when I got there, so I just sat down on one of those leather couches right near the clock in the lobby and watched the girls. A lot of schools were home for vacation already, and there were about a million girls sitting and standing around waiting for their dates to show up. Girls with their legs crossed, girls with their legs not crossed, girls with terrific legs, girls with lousy legs, girls that looked like swell girls, girls that looked like they'd be bitches if you knew them. It was really nice sightseeing, if you know what I mean. In a way, it was sort of depressing, too, because you kept wondering what the hell would happen to all of them. When they got out of school and college, I mean. You figured most of them would probably marry dopey guys. Guys that always talk about how many miles they get to a gallon in their goddam cars. Guys that get sore and childish as hell if you beat them at golf, or even just some stupid game like ping-pong. Guys that are very mean. Guys that never read books. Guys that are very boring— But I have to be careful about that. I mean about calling certain guys bores. I don’t understand boring guys. I really don't. When I was at Elkton Hills, I roomed for about two months with this boy, Forrest Graham. He was very intelligent and all, but he was one of the biggest bores I ever met. He had one of these very raspy voices, and he never stopped talking, practically. He never stopped talking, and what was awful was, he never said anything you wanted to hear in the first place. But he could do one thing. The sonuvabitch could whistle better than anybody I ever heard. He'd be making his bed, or hanging up stuff in the closet— he was always hanging up stuff in the closet— it drove me crazy— and he’d be whistling while he did it, if he wasn’t talking in this raspy voice. He could even whistle classical stuff, but most of the time he just whistled jazz. He could take something very jazzy, like \"Tin Roof Blues,\" and whistle it so nice and easy— right \n\nwhile he was hanging stuff up in the closet— that it could kill you. Naturally, I never told him I thought he was a terrific whistler. I mean you don’t just go up to somebody and say, \"You're a terrific whistler.\" But I roomed with him for about two whole months, even though he bored me till I was half crazy, just because he was such a terrific whistler, the best I ever heard. So I don't know about bores. Maybe you shouldn’t feel too sorry if you see some swell girl getting married to them. They don't hurt anybody, most of them, and maybe they're secretly all terrific whistlers or something. Who the hell knows? Not me. \n\nFinally, old Lana started coming up the stairs, and I started down to meet her. She looked terrific. She really did. She had on this black coat and sort of a black beret. She hardly ever wore a hat, but that beret looked nice. The funny part is, I felt like marrying her the minute I saw her. I'm crazy. I didn’t even like her much, and yet all of a sudden I felt like I was in love with her and wanted to marry her. I swear to God I'm crazy. I admit it. \n\n\"Miles!\" she said. \"It's marvelous to see you! It's been ages.\" She had one of these very loud, embarrassing voices when you met her somewhere. She got away with it because she was so damn good-looking, but it always gave me a pain in the ass. \n\n\"Swell to see you,\" I said. I meant it, too. \"How are ya, anyway?\" \n\n\"Absolutely marvelous. Am I late?\" \n\nI told her no, but she was around ten minutes late, as a matter of fact. I didn’t give a damn, though. All that crap they have in cartoons in the Saturday Evening Post and all, showing guys on street corners looking sore as hell because their dates are late— that's bunk. If a girl looks swell when she meets you, who gives a damn if she's late? Nobody. \"We better hurry,\" I said. \"The show starts at two-forty.\" We started going down the stairs to where the taxis are. \n\n\"What are we going to see?\" she said. \n\n\"I don’t know. The Lunts. It's all I could get tickets for.\" \n\n\"The Lunts! Oh, marvelous!\" I told you she’d go mad when she heard it was for the Lunts. \n\nWe horsed around a little bit in the cab on the way over to the theater. At first she didn't want to, because she had her lipstick on and all, but I was being seductive as hell and she didn’t have any alternative. Twice, when the goddam cab stopped short in traffic, \n\nI damn near fell off the seat. Those damn drivers never even look where they're going, I swear they don’t. Then, just to show you how crazy I am, when we were coming out of this big clinch, I told her I loved her and all. It was a lie, of course, but the thing is, I meant it when I said it. I'm crazy. I swear to God I am. \n\n\"Oh, darling, I love you too,\" she said. Then, right in the same damn breath, she said, \"Promise me you'll let your hair grow. Crew cuts are getting corny. And your hair’s so lovely.\" \n\nLovely my ass. \n\nThe show wasn’t as bad as some I've seen. It was on the crappy side, though. It was about five hundred thousand years in the life of this one old couple. It starts out when they're young and all, and the girl's parents don’t want her to marry the boy, but she marries him anyway. Then they keep getting older and older. The husband goes to war, and the wife has this brother that's a drunkard. I couldn’t get very interested. I mean I didn't care too much when anybody in the family died or anything. They were all just a bunch of actors. The husband and wife were a pretty nice old couple— very witty and all— \n\nbut I couldn’t get too interested in them. For one thing, they kept drinking tea or some goddam thing all through the play. Every time you saw them, some butler was shoving some tea in front of them, or the wife was pouring it for somebody. And everybody kept coming in and going out all the time— you got dizzy watching people sit down and stand up. Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne were the old couple, and they were very good, but I didn't like them much. They were different, though, I'll say that. They didn't act like people and they didn’t act like actors. It’s hard to explain. They acted more like they knew they were celebrities and all. I mean they were good, but they were too good. When one of them got finished making a speech, the other one said something very fast right after it. It was supposed to be like people really talking and interrupting each other and all. The trouble was, it was too much like people talking and interrupting each other. They acted a little bit the way old Evan, down in the Village, plays the piano. If you do something too good, then, after a while, if you don’t watch it, you start showing off. And then you're not as good any more. But anyway, they were the only ones in the show— the Lunts, I mean— that looked like they had any real brains. I have to admit it. \n\nAt the end of the first act we went out with all the other jerks for a cigarette. What a deal that was. You never saw so many phonies in all your life, everybody smoking their ears off and talking about the play so that everybody could hear and know how sharp they were. Some dopey movie actor was standing near us, having a cigarette. I don't know his name, but he always plays the part of a guy in a war movie that gets yellow before it's time to go over the top. He was with some gorgeous blonde, and the two of them were trying to be very blase and all, like as if he didn’t even know people were looking at him. Modest as hell. I got a big bang out of it. Old Lana didn’t talk much, except to rave about the Lunts, because she was busy rubbering and being charming. Then all of a sudden, she saw some jerk she knew on the other side of the lobby. Some guy in one of those very dark gray flannel suits and one of those checkered vests. Strictly Ivy League. Big deal. \n\nHe was standing next to the wall, smoking himself to death and looking bored as hell. \n\nOld Lana kept saying, \"I know that boy from somewhere.\" She always knew somebody, any place you took her, or thought she did. She kept saying that till I got bored as hell, and I said to her, \"Why don’t you go on over and give him a big soul kiss, if you know him? He’ll enjoy it.\" She got sore when I said that. Finally, though, the jerk noticed her and came over and said hello. You should've seen the way they said hello. You’d have thought they hadn’t seen each other in twenty years. You'd have thought they'd taken baths in the same bathtub or something when they were little kids. Old buddyroos. It was nauseating. The funny part was, they probably met each other just once, at some phony party. Finally, when they were all done slobbering around, old Lana introduced us. His name was Henry something— I don’t even remember— and he went to Andover. Big, big deal. You should've seen him when old Lana asked him how he liked the play. He was the kind of a phony that have to give themselves room when they answer somebody's question. He stepped back, and stepped right on the lady's foot behind him. He probably broke every toe in her body. He said the play itself was no masterpiece, but that the Lunts, of course, were absolute angels. Angels. For Chrissake. Angels. That killed me. Then he and old Lana started talking about a lot of people they both knew. It was the phoniest conversation you ever heard in your life. They both kept thinking of places as fast as they could, then they'd think of somebody that lived there and mention their name. I was all set to puke when it was time to go sit down again. I really was. And then, when \n\nthe next act was over, they continued their goddam boring conversation. They kept thinking of more places and more names of people that lived there. The worst part was, the jerk had one of those very phony, Ivy League voices, one of those very tired, snobby voices. He sounded just like a girl. He didn’t hesitate to horn in on my date, the bastard. I even thought for a minute that he was going to get in the goddam cab with us when the show was over, because he walked about two blocks with us, but he had to meet a bunch of phonies for cocktails, he said. I could see them all sitting around in some bar, with their goddam checkered vests, criticizing shows and books and women in those tired, snobby voices. They kill me, those guys. \n\nI sort of hated old Lana by the time we got in the cab, after listening to that phony Andover bastard for ",

    "context": "e it on. I couldn’t, I know. I think amethysts are just sweet. They are what I used to think diamonds were like. Long ago, before I had ever seen a diamond, I read about them and I tried to imagine what they would be like. I thought they would be lovely glimmering purple stones. When I saw a real diamond in a lady’s ring one day I was so disappointed I cried. Of course, it was very lovely but it wasn’t my idea of a diamond. Will you let me hold the brooch for one minute, Edna? Do you think amethysts can be the souls of good violets?”\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\nClara’s Confession\nON the Monday evening before the picnic Edna came down from her room with a troubled face.\n\n“Clara,” she said to that small personage, who was shelling peas by the spotless table and singing, “Nelly of the Hazel Dell” with a vigor and expression that did credit to Sophia’s teaching, “did you see anything of my amethyst brooch? I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came home from church yesterday evening, but I can’t find it anywhere.”\n\n“I—I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society,” said Clara, a little slowly. “I was passing your door when I saw it on the cushion, so I went in to look at it.”\n\n“Did you touch it?” said Edna sternly.\n\n“Y-e-e-s,” admitted Clara, “I took it up and I pinned it on my breast just to see how it would look.”\n\n“You had no business to do anything of the sort. It’s very wrong in a little girl to meddle. You shouldn’t have gone into my room in the first place and you shouldn’t have touched a brooch that didn’t belong to you in the second. Where did you put it?”\n\n“Oh, I put it back on the bureau. I hadn’t it on a minute. Truly, I didn’t mean to meddle, Edna. I didn’t think about its being wrong to go in and try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I’ll never do it again. That’s one good thing about me. I never do the same naughty thing twice.”\n\n“You didn’t put it back,” said Edna. “That brooch isn’t anywhere on the bureau. You’ve taken it out or something, Clara.”\n\n“I did put it back,” said Clara quickly—pertly, Edna thought. “I don’t just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in the china tray. But I’m perfectly certain I put it back.”\n\n“I’ll go and have another look,” said Edna, determining to be just. “If you put that brooch back it’s there still. If it isn’t I’ll know you didn’t, that’s all!”\n\nEdna went to her room and made a thorough search, not only over the bureau but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly be. It was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen.\n\n“Clara, the brooch is gone. By your own admission you were the last person to handle it. Now, what have you done with it? Tell me the truth at once. Did you take it out and lose it?”\n\n“No, I didn’t,” said Clara solemnly, meeting Edna’s angry gaze squarely. “I never took the brooch out of your room and that is the truth, if I was to be led to the block for it—although I’m not very certain what a block is. So there, Edna.”\n\nClara’s “so there” was only intended to emphasize her assertion, but Edna took it as a display of defiance.\n\n“I believe you are telling me a falsehood, Clara,” she said sharply. “I know you are. There now, don’t say anything more unless you are prepared to tell the whole truth. Go to your room and stay there until you are ready to confess.”\n\n“Will I take the peas with me?” said Clara meekly.\n\n“No, I’ll finish shelling them myself. Do as I bid you.”\n\nWhen Clara had gone Edna went about her evening tasks in a very disturbed state of mind. She was worried about her valuable brooch. What if Clara had lost it? And how wicked of the child to deny having taken it, when anybody could see she must have! With such an innocent face, too!\n\n“I don’t know what I wouldn’t sooner have had happen,” thought Edna, as she nervously shelled the peas. “Of course, I don’t suppose she meant to steal it or anything like that. She’s just taken it to play with or help along that imagination of hers. She must have taken it, that’s clear, for there hasn’t been a soul in that room since she was in it, by her own story, until I went up tonight. And the brooch is gone, there’s nothing surer. I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for fear she’ll be punished. It’s a dreadful thing to think she tells falsehoods. It’s a far worse thing than her fit of temper. It’s a fearful responsibility to have a child in your house you can’t trust. Slyness and untruthfulness—that’s what she has displayed. I declare I feel worse about that than about the brooch. If she’d only have told the truth about it I wouldn’t mind so much.”\n\nEdna went to her room at intervals all through the evening and searched for the brooch, without finding it. A bedtime visit to the east gable produced no result. Clara persisted in denying that she knew anything about the brooch but Edna was only the more firmly convinced that she did.\n\nShe told Donald the story the next morning. Donald was confounded and puzzled; he could not so quickly lose faith in Clara but he had to admit that circumstances were against her.\n\n“You’re sure it hasn’t fell down behind the bureau?” was the only suggestion he could offer.\n\n“I’ve moved the bureau and I’ve taken out the drawers and I’ve looked in every crack and cranny” was Edna’s positive answer. “The brooch is gone and that child has taken it and lied about it. That’s the plain, ugly truth, Donald Forsythe, and we might as well look it in the face.”\n\n“Well now, what are you going to do about it?” Donald asked forlornly, feeling secretly thankful that Edna and not he had to deal with the situation. He felt no desire to put his oar in this time.\n\n“She’ll stay in her room until she confesses,” said Edna grimly, remembering the success of this method in the former case. “Then we’ll see. Perhaps we’ll be able to find the brooch if she’ll only tell where she took it; but in any case she’ll have to be severely punished, Donald.”\n\n“Well now, you’ll have to punish her,” said Donald, reaching for his hat. “I’ve nothing to do with it, remember. You warned me off yourself.”\n\nEdna felt deserted by everyone. She could not even go to Mrs. Harper for advice. She went up to the east gable with a very serious face and left it with a face more serious still. Clara steadfastly refused to confess. She persisted in asserting that she had not taken the brooch. The child had evidently been crying and Edna felt a pang of pity which she sternly repressed. By night she was, as she expressed it, “beat out.”\n\n“You’ll stay in this room until you confess, Clara. You can make up your mind to that,” she said firmly.\n\n“But the picnic is tomorrow, Edna,” cried Clara. “You won’t keep me from going to that, will you? You’ll just let me out for the afternoon, won’t you? Then I’ll stay here as long as you like afterwards cheerfully. But I must go to the picnic.”\n\n“You’ll not go to picnics nor anywhere else until you’ve confessed, Clara.”\n\n“Oh, Edna,” gasped Clara.\n\nBut Edna had gone out and shut the door.\n\nWednesday morning dawned as bright and fair as if expressly made to order for the picnic. Birds sang around Green Gables; the Madonna lilies in the garden sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless winds at every door and window, and wandered through halls and rooms like spirits of benediction. The birches in the hollow waved joyful hands as if watching for Clara’s usual morning greeting from the east gable. But Clara was not at her window. When Edna took her breakfast up to her she found the child sitting primly on her bed, pale and resolute, with tight-shut lips and gleaming eyes.\n\n“Edna, I’m ready to confess.”\n\n“Ah!” Edna laid down her tray. Once again her method had succeeded; but her success was very bitter to her. “Let me hear what you have to say then, Clara.”\n\n“I took the amethyst brooch,” said Clara, as if repeating a lesson she had learned. “I took it just as you said. I didn’t mean to take it when I went in. But it did look so beautiful, Edna, when I pinned it on my breast that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation. I imagined how perfectly thrilling it would be to take it to Idlewild and play I was the Lady Veronica Lancaster. It would be so much easier to imagine I was the Lady Veronica if I had a real amethyst brooch on. Sophia and I make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts? So I took the brooch. I thought I could put it back before you came home. I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time. When I was going over the bridge across the Lake of Shining Waters I took the brooch off to have another look at it. Oh, how it did shine in the sunlight! And then, when I was leaning over the bridge, it just slipped through my fingers—so—and went down—down—down, all purply-sparkling, and sank forevermore beneath the Lake of Shining Waters. And that’s the best I can do at confessing, Edna.”\n\nEdna felt hot anger surge up into her heart again. This child had taken and lost her treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly reciting the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or repentance.\n\n“Clara, this is terrible,” she said, trying to speak calmly. “You are the very wickedest girl I ever heard of.”\n\n“Yes, I suppose I am,” agreed Clara tranquilly. “And I know I’ll have to be punished. It’ll be your duty to punish me, Edna. Won’t you please get it over right off because I’d like to go to the picnic with nothing on my mind.”\n\n“Picnic, indeed! You’ll go to no picnic today, Clara Fisher. That shall be your punishment. And it isn’t half severe enough either for what you’ve done!”\n\n“Not go to the picnic!” Clara sprang to her feet and clutched Edna’s hand. “But you promised me I might! Oh, Edna, I must go to the picnic. That was why I confessed. Punish me any way you like but that. Oh, Edna, please, please, let me go to the picnic. Think of the ice cream! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice cream again.”\n\nEdna disengaged Clara’s clinging hands stonily.\n\n“You needn’t plead, Clara. You are not going to the picnic and that’s final. No, not a word.”\n\nClara realized that Edna was not to be moved. She clasped her hands together, gave a piercing shriek, and then flung herself face downward on the bed, crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of disappointment and despair.\n\n“For the land’s sake!” gasped Edna, hastening from the room. “I believe the child is crazy. No child in her senses would behave as she does. If she isn’t she’s utterly bad. Oh dear, I’m afraid Beatrice was right from the first. But I’ve put my hand to the plow and I won’t look back.”\n\nThat was a dismal morning. Edna worked fiercely and scrubbed the porch floor and the dairy shelves when she could find nothing else to do. Neither the shelves nor the porch needed it—but Edna did. Then she went out and raked the yard.\n\nWhen dinner was ready she went to the stairs and called Clara. A tear-stained face appeared, looking tragically over the banisters.\n\n“Come down to your dinner, Clara.”\n\n“I don’t want any dinner, Edna,” said Clara, sobbingly. “I couldn’t eat anything. My heart is broken. You’ll feel remorse of conscience someday, I expect, for breaking it, Edna, but I forgive you. Remember when the time comes that I forgive you. But please don’t ask me to eat anything, especially boiled pork and greens. Boiled pork and greens are so unromantic when one is in affliction.”\n\nExasperated, Edna returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale of woe to Donald, who, between his sense of justice and his unlawful sympathy with Clara, was a miserable man.\n\n“Well now, she shouldn’t have taken the brooch, Edna, or told stories about it,” he admitted, mournfully surveying his plateful of unromantic pork and greens as if he, like Clara, thought it a food unsuited to crises of feeling, “but she’s such a little thing—such an interesting little thing. Don’t you think it’s pretty rough not to let her go to the picnic when she’s so set on it?”\n\n“Donald Forsythe, I’m amazed at you. I think I’ve let her off entirely too easy. And she doesn’t appear to realize how wicked she’s been at all—that’s what worries me most. If she’d really felt sorry it wouldn’t be so bad. And you don’t seem to realize it, neither; you’re making excuses for her all the time to yourself—I can see that.”\n\n“Well now, she’s such a little thing,” feebly reiterated Donald. “And there should be allowances made, Edna. You know she’s never had any bringing up.”\n\n“Well, she’s having it now” retorted Edna.\n\nThe retort silenced Donald if it did not convince him. That dinner was a very dismal meal. The only cheerful thing about it was Max Fontaine, the hired boy, and Edna resented his cheerfulness as a personal insult.\n\nWhen her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed Edna remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black lace shawl when she had taken it off on Monday afternoon on returning from the Ladies’ Aid.\n\nShe would go and mend it. The shawl was in a box in her trunk. As Edna lifted it out, the sunlight, falling through the vines that clustered thickly about the window, struck upon something caught in the shawl—something that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light. Edna snatched at it with a gasp. It was the amethyst brooch, hanging to a thread of the lace by its catch!\n\n“Dear life and heart,” said Edna blankly, “what does this mean? Here’s my brooch safe and sound that I thought was at the bottom of Barry’s pond. Whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost it? I declare I believe Green Gables is bewitched. I remember now that when I took off my shawl Monday afternoon I laid it on the bureau for a minute. I suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow. Well!”\n\nEdna betook herself to the east gable, brooch in hand. Clara had cried herself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window.\n\n“Clara Fisher,” said Edna solemnly, “I’ve just found my brooch hanging to my black lace shawl. Now I want to know what that rigmarole you told me this morning meant.”\n\n“Why, you said you’d keep me here until I confessed,” returned Clara wearily, “and so I decided to confess because I was bound to get to the picnic. I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and made it as interesting as I could. And I said it over and over so that I wouldn’t forget it. But you wouldn’t let me go to the picnic after all, so all my trouble was wasted.”\n\nEdna had to laugh in spite of herself. But her conscience pricked her.\n\n“Clara, you do beat all! But I was wrong—I see that now. I shouldn’t have doubted your word when I’d never known you to tell a story. Of course, it wasn’t right for you to confess to a thing you hadn’t done—it was very wrong to do so. But I drove you to it. So if you’ll forgive me, Clara, I’ll forgive you and we’ll start square again. And now get yourself ready for the picnic.”\n\nClara flew up like a rocket.\n\n“Oh, Edna, isn’t it too late?”\n\n“No, it’s only two o’clock. They won’t be more than well gathered yet and it’ll be an hour before they have tea. Wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham. I’ll fill a basket for you. There’s plenty of stuff baked in the house. And I’ll get Max to hitch up the sorrel and drive you down to the picnic ground.”\n\n“Oh, Edna,” exclaimed Clara, flying to the washstand. “Five minutes ago I was so miserable I was wishing I’d never been born and now I wouldn’t change places with an angel!”\n\nThat night a thoroughly happy, completely tired-out Clara returned to Green Gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe.\n\n“Oh, Edna, I’ve had a perfectly scrumptious time. Scrumptious is a new word I learned today. I heard Nora Carter use it. Isn’t it very expressive? Everything was lovely. We had a splendid tea and then Mr. Marvin Chapman took us all for a row on the Lake of Shining Waters—six of us at a time. And Martha Chapman nearly fell overboard. She was leaning out to pick water lilies and if Mr. Chapman hadn’t caught her by her sash just in the nick of time she’d fallen in and prob’ly been drowned. I wish it had been me. It would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly drowned. It would be such a thrilling tale to tell. And we had the ice cream. Words fail me to describe that ice cream. Edna, I assure you it was sublime.”\n\nThat evening Edna told the whole story to Donald over her stocking basket.\n\n“I’m willing to own up that I made a mistake,” she concluded candidly, “but I’ve learned a lesson. I have to laugh when I think of Clara’s ‘confession,’ although I suppose I shouldn’t for it really was a falsehood. But it doesn’t seem as bad as the other would have been, somehow, and anyhow I’m responsible for it. That child is hard to understand in some respects. But I believe she’ll turn out all right yet. And there’s one thing certain, no house will ever be dull that she’s in.”\n\nCHAPTER XV.\nA Tempest in the School Teapot\nWHAT a splendid day!” said Clara, drawing a long breath. “Isn’t it good just to be alive on a day like this? I pity the people who aren’t born yet for missing it. They may have good days, of course, but they can never have this one. And it’s splendider still to have such a lovely way to go to school by, isn’t it?”\n\n“It’s a lot nicer than going round by the road; that is so dusty and hot,” said Sophia practically, peeping into her dinner basket and mentally calculating if the three juicy, toothsome, raspberry tarts reposing there were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl would have.\n\nThe little girls of Avonlea school always pooled their lunches, and to eat three raspberry tarts all alone or even to share them only with one’s best chum would have forever and ever branded as “awful mean” the girl who did it. And yet, when the tarts were divided among ten girls you just got enough to tantalize you.\n\nThe way Clara and Sophia went to school was a pretty one. Clara thought those walks to and from school with Sophia couldn’t be improved upon even by imagination. Going around by the main road would have been so unromantic; but to go by Lover’s Lane and Willowmere and Violet Vale and the Birch Path was romantic, if ever anything was.\n\nLover’s Lane opened out below the orchard at Green Gables and stretched far up into the woods to the end of the Cuthbert farm. It was the way by which the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home in winter. Clara had named it Lover’s Lane before she had been a month at Green Gables.\n\n“Not that lovers ever really walk there,” she explained to Edna, “but Sophia and I are reading a perfectly magnificent book and there’s a Lover’s Lane in it. So we want to have one, too. And it’s a very pretty name, don’t you think? So romantic! We can’t imagine the lovers into it, you know. I like that lane because you can think out loud there without people calling you crazy.”\n\nClara, starting out alone in the morning, went down Lover’s Lane as far as the brook. Here Sophia met her, and the two little girls went on up the lane under the leafy arch of maples—“maples are such sociable trees,” said Clara; “they’re always rustling and whispering to you”—until they came to a rustic bridge. Then they left the lane and walked through Mr. Greene’s back field and past Willowmere. Beyond Willowmere came Violet Vale—a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr. Andrew Bell’s big woods. “Of course there are no violets there now,” Clara told Edna, “but Sophia says there are millions of them in spring. Oh, Edna, can’t you just imagine you see them? It actually takes away my breath. I named it Violet Vale. Sophia says she never saw the beat of me for hitting on fancy names for places. It’s nice to be clever at something, isn’t it? But Sophia named the Birch Path. She wanted to, so I let her; but I’m sure I could have found something more poetical than plain Birch Path. Anybody can think of a name like that. But the Birch Path is one of the prettiest places in the world, Edna.”\n\nIt was. Other people besides Clara thought so when they stumbled on it. It was a little narrow, twisting path, winding down over a long hill straight through Mr. Carter’s woods, where the light came down sifted through so many emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart of a diamond. It was fringed in all its length with slim young birches, white stemmed and lissom boughed; ferns and starflowers and wild lilies-of-the-valley and scarlet tufts of pigeonberries grew thickly along it; and always there was a delightful spiciness in the air and music of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood winds in the trees overhead. Now and then you might see a rabbit skipping across the road if you were quiet—which, with Clara and Sophia, happened about once in a blue moon. Down in the valley the path came out to the main road and then it was just up the spruce hill to the school.\n\nThe Avonlea school was a whitewashed building, low in the eaves and wide in the windows, furnished inside with comfortable substantial old-fashioned desks that opened and shut, and were carved all over their lids with the initials and hieroglyphics of three generations of school children. The schoolhouse was set back from the road and behind it was a dusky fir wood and a brook where all the children put their bottles of milk in the morning to keep cool and sweet until dinner hour.\n\nEdna had seen Clara start off to school on the first day of September with many secret misgivings. Clara was such an odd girl. How would she get on with the other children? And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours?\n\nThings went better than Edna feared, however. Clara came home that evening in high spirits.\n\n“I think I’m going to like school here,” she announced. “I don’t think much of the master, though. He’s all the time curling his mustache and making eyes at Lena Chapman. Lena is grown up, you know. She’s sixteen and she’s studying for the entrance examination into Queen’s Academy at Charlottetown next year. Emma Conner says the master is dead gone on her. She’s got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair and she does it up so elegantly. She sits in the long seat at the back and he sits there, too, most of the time—to explain her lessons, he says. But Coral Hayes says she saw him writing something on her slate and when Lena read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled; and Coral Hayes says she doesn’t believe it had anything to do with the lesson.”\n\n“Clara Fisher, don’t let me hear you talking about your teacher in that way again,” said Edna sharply. “You don’t go to school to criticize the master. I guess he can teach you something, and it’s your business to learn. And I want you to understand right off that you are not to come home telling tales about him. That is something I won’t encourage. I hope you were a good girl.”\n\n“Indeed I was,” said Clara comfortably. “It wasn’t so hard as you might imagine, either. I sit with Sophia. Our seat is right by the window and we can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters. There are a lot of nice girls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime. It’s so nice to have a lot of little girls to play with. But of course I like Sophia best and always will. I adore Sophia. I’m dreadfully far behind the others. They’re all in the fifth book and I’m only in the fourth. I feel that it’s kind of a disgrace. But there’s not one of them has such an imagination as I have and I soon found that out. We had reading and geography and Canadian history and dictation today. Mr. Edwards said my spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could see it, all marked over. I felt so mortified, Edna; he might have been politer to a stranger, I think. Coral Hayes gave me an apple and Clara Russell lent me a lovely pink card with ‘May I see you home?’ on it. I’m to give it back to her tomorrow. And Emma Conner let me wear her bead ring all the afternoon. Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh, Edna, Martha Chapman told me that Dolly Wilson told her that she heard Lena Chapman tell Harper Hayes that I had a very pretty nose. Edna, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you can’t imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. Edna, have I really a pretty nose? I know you’ll tell me the truth.”\n\n“Your nose is well enough,” said Edna shortly. Secretly she thought Clara’s nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention of telling her so.\n\nThat was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far. And now, this crisp September morning, Clara and Sophia were tripping blithely down the Birch Path, two of the happiest little girls in Avonlea.\n\n“I guess Rowan Blake will be in school today,” said Sophia. “He’s been visiting his cousins over in New Brunswick all summer and he only came home Saturday night. He’s aw’fly handsome, Clara. And he teases the girls something terrible. He just torments our lives out.”\n\nSophia’s voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented out than not.\n\n“Rowan Blake?” said Clara. “Isn’t his name that’s written up on the porch wall with Olive Carter’s and a big ‘Take Notice’ over them?”\n\n“Yes,” said Sophia, tossing her head, “but I’m sure he doesn’t like Olive Carter so very much. I’ve heard him say he studied the multiplication table by her freckles.”\n\n“Oh, don’t speak about freckles to me,” implored Clara. “It isn’t delicate when I’ve got so many. But I do think that writing take-notices up on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever. I should just like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy’s. Not, of course,” she hastened to add, “that anybody would.”\n\nClara sighed. She didn’t want her name written up. But it was a little humiliating to know that there was no danger of it.\n\n“Nonsense,” said Sophia, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played such havoc with the hearts of Avonlea schoolboys that her name figured on the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices. “It’s only meant as a joke. And don’t you be too sure your name won’t ever be written up. Jack Russell is dead gone on you. He told his mother—his mother, mind you—that you were the smartest girl in school. That’s better than being good looking.”\n\n“No, it isn’t,” said Clara, feminine to the core. “I’d rather be pretty than clever. And I hate Jack Russell, I can’t bear a boy with goggle eyes. If anyone wrote my name up with his I’d never get over it, Sophia Greene. But it is nice to keep head of your class.”\n\n“You’ll have Rowan in your class after this,” said Sophia, “and he’s used to being head of his class, I can tell you. He’s only in the fourth book although he’s nearly fourteen. Four years ago his father was sick and had to go out to Alberta for his health and Rowan went with him. They were there three years and Gil didn’t go to school hardly any until they came back. You won’t find it so easy to keep head after this, Clara.”\n\n“I’m glad,” said Clara quickly. “I couldn’t really feel proud of keeping head of little boys and girls of just nine or ten. I got up yesterday spelling ‘ebullition.’ Hannah Ford was head and, mind you, she peeped in her book. Mr. Edwards didn’t see her—he was looking at Lena Chapman—but I did. I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.”\n\n“Those Pye girls are cheats all round,” said Sophia indignantly, as they climbed the fence of the main road. “Heather Ford actually went and put her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. Did you ever? I don’t speak to her now.”\n\nWhen Mr. Edwards was in the back of the room hearing Lena Chapman’s Latin, Sophia whispered to Clara, “That’s Rowan Blake sitting right across the aisle from you, Clara. Just look at him and see if you don’t think he’s handsome.”\n\nClara looked accordingly. She had a good chance to do so, for the said Rowan Blake was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid of Coral Hayes, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. He was a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth twisted into a teasing smile. Presently Coral Hayes started up to take a sum to the master; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek, believing that her hair was pulled out by the roots. Everybody looked at her and Mr. Edwards glared so sternly that Coral began to cry. Rowan had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the soberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he looked at Clara and winked with inexpressible drollery.\n\n“I think your Rowan Blake is handsome,” confided Clara to Sophia, “but I think he’s very bold. It isn’t good manners to wink at a strange girl.”\n\nBut it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.\n\nMr. Edwards was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to Lena Chapman and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as they pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their slates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle. Rowan Blake was trying to make Clara Fisher look at him and failing utterly, because Clara was at that moment totally oblivious not only to the very existence of Rowan Blake, but of every other scholar in Avonlea school itself. With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes fixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west window afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and seeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.\n\nRowan Blake wasn’t used to putting himself out to make a girl look at him and meeting with failure. She should look at him, that red-haired Shirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren’t like the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school.\n\nRowan reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Clara’s long red braid, held it out at arm’s length and said in a piercing whisper:\n\n“Carrots! Carrots!”\n\nThen Clara looked at him with a vengeance!\n\nShe did more than look. She sprang to her feet, her bright fancies fallen into cureless ruin. She flashed one indignant glance at Rowan from eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry tears.\n\n“You mean, hateful boy!” she exclaimed passionately. “How dare you!”\n\nAnd then—thwack! Clara had brought her slate down on Rowan’s head and cracked it—slate not head—clear across.\n\nAvonlea school always enjoyed a scene. This was an especially enjoyable one. Everybody said “Oh” in horrified delight. Sophia gasped. Coral Hayes, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. Jake Russell let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared open-mouthed at the tableau.\n\nMr. Edwards stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on Clara’s shoulder.\n\n“Clara Fisher, what does this mean?” he said angrily. Clara returned no answer. It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell before the whole school that she had been called “carrots.” Rowan it was who spoke up stoutly.\n\n“It was my fault Mr. Edwards. I teased her.”\n\nMr. Edwards paid no heed to Rowan.\n\n“I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such a vindictive spirit,” he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of being a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts of small imperfect mortals. “Clara, go and stand on the platform in front of the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.”\n\nClara would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under which her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white, set face she obeyed. Mr. Edwards took a chalk crayon and wrote on the blackboard above her head.\n\n“Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control her temper,” and then read it out loud so that even the primer class, who couldn’t read writing, should understand it.\n\nClara stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her. She did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. With resentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Sophia’s sympathetic gaze and Jack Russell’s indignant nods and Hannah Ford’s malicious smiles. As for Rowan Blake, she would not even look at him. She would never look at him again! She would never speak to him!!\n\nWhen school was dismissed Clara marched out with her red head held high. Rowan Blake tried to intercept her at the porch door.\n\n“I’m awfully sorry I made fun of your hair, Clara,” he whispered contritely. “Honest I am. Don’t be mad for keeps, now.”\n\nClara swept by disdainfully, without look or sign of hearing. “Oh how could you, Clara?” breathed Sophia as they went down the road half reproachfully, half admiringly. Sophia felt that she could never have resisted Rowan’s plea.\n\n“I shall never forgive Rowan Blake,” said Clara firmly. “And Mr. Edwards spelled my name without an e, too. The iron has entered into my soul, Sophia.”\n\nSophia hadn’t the least idea what Clara meant but she understood it was something terrible.\n\n“You mustn’t mind Rowan making fun of your hair,” she said soothingly. “Why, he makes fun of all the girls. He laughs at mine because it’s so black. He’s called me a crow a dozen times; and I never heard him apologize for anything before, either.”\n\n“There’s a great deal of difference between being called a crow and being called carrots,” said Clara with dignity. “Rowan Blake has hurt my feelings excruciatingly, Sophia.”\n\nIt is possible the matter might have blown over without more excruciation if nothing else had happened. But when things begin to happen they are apt to keep on.\n\nAvonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in Mr. Carter’s spruce grove over the hill and across his big pasture field. From there they could keep an eye on Eben Wright’s house, where the master boarded. When they saw Mr. Edwards emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse; but the distance being about three times longer than Mr. Wright’s lane they were very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three minutes too late.\n\nOn the following day Mr. Edwards was seized with one of his spasmodic fits of reform and announced before going home to dinner, that he should expect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned. Anyone who came in late would be punished.\n\nAll the boys and some of the girls went to Mr. Carter’s spruce grove as usual, fully intending to stay only long enough to “pick a chew.” But spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling; they picked and loitered and strayed; and as usual the first thing that recalled them to a sense of the flight of time was Simon Cook shouting from the top of a patriarchal old spruce “Master’s coming.”\n\nThe girls who were on the ground, started first and managed to reach the schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare. The boys, who had to wriggle hastily down from the trees, were later; and Clara, who had not been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the grove, waist deep among the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a wreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity of the shadowy places, was latest of all. Clara could run like a deer, however; run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys at the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as Mr. Edwards was in the act of hanging up his hat.\n\nMr. Edwards’s brief reforming energy was over; he didn’t want the bother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something to save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it in Clara, who had dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a particularly rakish and disheveled appearance.\n\n“Clara Fisher, since you seem to be so fond of the boys’ company we shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon,” he said sarcastically. “Take those flowers out of your hair and sit with Rowan Blake.”\n\nThe other boys snickered. Sophia, turning pale with pity, plucked the wreath from Clara’s hair and squeezed her hand. Clara stared at the master as if turned to stone.\n\n“Did you hear what I said, Clara?” queried Mr. Edwards sternly.\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Clara slowly “but I didn’t suppose you really meant it.”\n\n“I assure you I did”—still with the sarcastic inflection which all the children, and Clara especially, hated. It flicked on the raw. “Obey me at once.”\n\nFor a moment Clara looked as if she meant to disobey. Then, realizing that there was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the aisle, sat down beside Rowan Blake, and buried her face in her arms on the desk. Coral Hayes, who got a glimpse of it as it went down, told the others going home from school that she’d “acksually never seen anything like it—it was so white, with awful little red spots in it.”\n\nTo Clara, this was as the end of all things. It was bad enough to be singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should be Rowan Blake was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly unbearable. Clara felt that she could not bear it and it would be of no use to try. Her whole being seethed with shame and anger and humiliation.\n\nAt first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged. But as Clara never lifted her head and as Rowan worked fractions as if his whole soul was absorbed in them and them only, they soon returned to their own tasks and Clara was forgotten. When Mr. Edwards called the history class out Clara should have gone, but Clara did not move, and Mr. Edwards, who had been writing some verses “To Felicia” before he called the class, was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never missed her. Once, when nobody was looking, Rowan took from his desk a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, “You are sweet,” and slipped it under the curve of Clara’s arm. Whereupon Clara arose, took the pink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers, dropped it on the floor, ground it to powder beneath her heel, and resumed her position without deigning to bestow a glance on Rowan.\n\nWhen school went out Clara marched to her desk, ostentatiously took out everything therein, books and writing tablet, pen and ink, testament and arithmetic, and piled them neatly on her cracked slate.\n\n“What are you taking all those things home for, Clara?” Sophia wanted to know, as soon as they were out on the road. She had not dared to ask the question before.\n\n“I am not coming back to school any more,” said Clara. Sophia gasped and stared at Clara to see if she meant it.\n\n“Will Edna let you stay home?” she asked.\n\n“She’ll have to,” said Clara. “I’ll never go to school to that man again.”\n\n“Oh, Clara!” Sophia looked as if she were ready to cry. “I do think you’re mean. What shall I do? Mr. Edwards will make me sit with that horrid Heather Ford—I know he will because she is sitting alone. Do come back, Clara.”\n\n“I’d do almost anything in the world for you, Sophia,” said Clara sadly. “I’d let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But I can’t do this, so please don’t ask it. You harrow up my very soul.”\n\n“Just think of all the fun you will miss,” mourned Sophia. “We are going to build the loveliest new house down by the brook; and we’ll be playing ball next week and you’ve never played ball, Clara. It’s tremendously exciting. And we’re going to learn a new song—Martha Chapman is practicing it up now; and Alice Andrews is going to bring a new Pansy book next week and we’re all going to read it out loud, chapter about, down by the brook. And you know you are so fond of reading out loud, Clara.”\n\nNothing moved Clara in the least. Her mind was made up. She would not go to school to Mr. Edwards again; she told Edna so when she got home.\n\n“Nonsense,” said Edna.\n\n“It isn’t nonsense at all,” said Clara, gazing at Edna with solemn, reproachful eyes. “Don’t you understand, Edna? I’ve been insulted.”\n\n“Insulted fiddlesticks! You’ll go to school tomorrow as usual.”\n\n“Oh, no.” Clara shook her head gently. “I’m not going back, Edna. I’ll learn my lessons at home and I’ll be as good as I can be and hold my tongue all the time if it’s possible at all. But I will not go back to school, I assure you.”\n\nEdna saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking out of Clara’s small face. She understood that she would have trouble in overcoming it; but she re-solved wisely to say nothing more just then. “I’ll run down and see Beatrice about it this evening,” she thought. “There’s no use reasoning with Clara now. She’s too worked up and I’ve an idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion. Far as I can make out from her story, Mr. Edwards has been carrying matters with a rather high hand. But it would never do to say so to her. I’ll just talk it over with Beatrice. She’s sent ten children to school and she ought to know something about it. She’ll have heard the whole story, too, by this time.”\n\nEdna found Mrs. Harper knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully as usual.\n\n“I suppose you know what I’ve come about,” she said, a little shamefacedly.\n\nMrs. Beatrice nodded.\n\n“About Clara’s fuss in school, I reckon,” she said. “Emma Conner was in on her way home from school and told me about it.”\n\n“I don’t know what to do with her,” said Edna. “She declares she won’t go back to school. I never saw a child so worked up. I’ve been expecting trouble ever since she started to school. I knew things were going too smooth to last. She’s so high strung. What would you advise, Beatrice?”\n\n“Well, since you’ve asked my advice, Edna,” said Mrs. Harper amiably—Mrs. Harper dearly loved to be asked for advice—“I’d just humor her a little at first, that’s what I’d do. It’s my belief that Mr. Edwards was in the wrong. Of course, it doesn’t do to say so to the children, you know. And of course he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who were late should have been punished as well as Clara, that’s what. And I don’t believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It isn’t modest. Emma Conner was real indignant. She took Clara’s part right through and said all the scholars did too. Clara seems real popular among them, somehow. I never thought she’d take with them so well.”\n\n“Then you really think I’d better let her stay home,” said Edna in amazement.\n\n“Yes. That is I wouldn’t say school to her again until she said it herself. Depend upon it, Edna, she’ll cool off in a week or so and be ready enough to go back of her own accord, that’s what, while, if you were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum she’d take next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the better, in my opinion. She won’t miss much by not going to school, as far as that goes. Mr. Edwards isn’t any good at all as a teacher. The order he keeps is scandalous, that’s what, and he neglects the young fry and puts all his time on those big scholars he’s getting ready for Queen’s. He’d never have got the school for another year if his uncle hadn’t been a trustee—the trustee, for he just leads the other two around by the nose, that’s what. I declare, I don’t know what education in this Island is coming to.”\n\nMrs. Beatrice shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the head of the educational system of the Province things would be much better managed.\n\nEdna took Mrs. Beatrice’s advice and not another word was said to Clara about going back to school. She learned her lessons at home, did her chores, and played with Sophia in the chilly purple autumn twilights; but when she met Rowan Blake on the road or encountered him in Sunday-school she passed him by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by his evident desire to appease her. Even Sophia’s efforts as a peacemaker were of no avail. Clara had evidently made up her mind to hate Rowan Blake to the end of life.\n\nAs much as she hated Rowan, however, did she love Sophia, with all the love of her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and dislikes. One evening Edna, coming in from the orchard with a basket of apples, found Clara sitting along by the east window in the twilight, crying bitterly.\n\n“Whatever’s the matter now, Clara?” she asked.\n\n“It’s about Sophia,” sobbed Clara luxuriously. “I love Sophia so, Edna. I cannot ever live without her. But I know very well when we grow up that Sophia will get married and go away and leave me. And oh, what shall I do? I hate her husband—I just hate him furiously. I’ve been imagining it all out—the wedding and everything—Sophia dressed in snowy garments, with a veil, and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen; and me the bridesmaid, with a lovely dress too, and puffed sleeves, but with a breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face. And then bidding Sophia goodbye-e-e—” Here Clara broke down entirely and wept with increasing bitterness.\n\nEdna turned quickly away to hide her twitching face; but it was no use; she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and unusual peal of laughter that Donald, crossing the yard outside, halted in amazement. When had he heard Edna laugh like that before?\n\n“Well, Clara Fisher,” said Edna as soon as she could speak, “if you must borrow trouble, for pity’s sake borrow it handier home. I should think you had an imagination, sure enough.”\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\nSophia Is Invited to Tea with Tragic Results\nOCTOBER was a beautiful month at Green Gables, when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild cherry-trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green, while the fields sunned themselves in aftermaths.\n\nClara reveled in the world of color about her.\n\n“Oh, Edna,” she exclaimed one Saturday morning, coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs, “I’m so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers. It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November, wouldn’t it? Look at these maple branches. Don’t they give you a thrill—several thrills? I’m going to decorate my room with them.”\n\n“Messy things,” said Edna, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed. “You clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors stuff, Clara. Bedrooms were made to sleep in.”\n\n“Oh, and dream in too, Edna. And you know one can dream so much better in a room where there are pretty things. I’m going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table.”\n\n“Mind you don’t drop leaves all over the stairs then. I’m going on a meeting of the Aid Society at Carmody this afternoon, Clara, and I won’t likely be home before dark. You’ll have to get Donald and Max their supper, so mind you don’t forget to put the tea to draw until you sit down at the table as you did last time.”\n\n“It was dreadful of me to forget,” said Clara apologetically, “but that was the afternoon I was trying to think of a name for Violet Vale and it crowded other things out. Donald was so good. He never scolded a bit. He put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not. And I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting, so he didn’t find the time long at all. It was a beautiful fairy story, Edna. I forgot the end of it, so I made up an end for it myself and Donald said he couldn’t tell where the join came in.”\n\n“Donald would think it all right, Clara, if you took a notion to get up and have dinner in the middle of the night. But you keep your wits about you this time. And—I don’t really know if I’m doing right—it may make you more addlepated than ever—but you can ask Sophia to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here.”\n\n“Oh, Edna!” Clara clasped her hands. “How perfectly lovely! You are able to imagine things after all or else you’d never have understood how I’ve longed for that very thing. It will seem so nice and grown-uppish. No fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when I have company. Oh, Edna, can I use the rosebud spray tea set?”\n\n“No, indeed! The rosebud tea set! Well, what next? You know I never use that except for the minister or the Aids. You’ll put down the old brown tea set. But you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves. It’s time it was being used anyhow—I believe it’s beginning to work. And you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps.”\n\n“I can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and pouring out the tea,” said Clara, shutting her eyes ecstatically. “And asking Sophia if she takes sugar! I know she doesn’t but of course I’ll ask her just as if I didn’t know. And then pressing her to take another piece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves. Oh, Edna, it’s a wonderful sensation just to think of it. Can I take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes? And then into the parlor to sit?”\n\n“No. The sitting room will do for you and your company. But there’s a bottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church social the other night. It’s on the second shelf of the sitting-room closet and you and Sophia can have it if you like, and a cooky to eat with it along in the afternoon, for I daresay Donald ‘ll be late coming in to tea since he’s hauling potatoes to the vessel.”\n\nClara flew down to the hollow, past the Dryad’s Bubble and up the spruce path to Orchard Slope, to ask Sophia to tea. As a result just after Edna had driven off to Carmody, Sophia came over, dressed in her second-best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked out to tea. At other times she was wont to run into the kitchen without knocking; but now she knocked primly at the front door. And when Clara, dressed in her second best, as primly opened it, both little girls shook hands as gravely as if they had never met before. This unnatural solemnity lasted until after Sophia had been taken to the east gable to lay off her hat and then had sat for ten minutes in the sitting room, toes in position.\n\n“How is your mother?” inquired Clara politely, just as if she had not seen Mrs. Greene picking apples that morning in excellent health and spirits.\n\n“She is very well, thank you. I suppose Mr. Forsythe is hauling potatoes to the lily sands this afternoon, is he?” said Sophia, who had ridden down to Mr. Marvin Chapman’s that morning in Donald’s cart.\n\n“Yes. Our potato crop is very good this year. I hope your father’s crop is good too.”\n\n“It is fairly good, thank you. Have you picked many of your apples yet?”\n\n“Oh, ever so many,” said Clara forgetting to be dignified and jumping up quickly. “Let’s go out to the orchard and get some of the Red Sweetings, Sophia. Edna says we can have all that are left on the tree. Edna is a very generous woman. She said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea. But it isn’t good manners to tell your company what you are going to give them to eat, so I won’t tell you what she said we could have to drink. Only it begins with an R and a C and it’s bright red color. I love bright red drinks, don’t you? They taste twice as good as any other color.”\n\nThe orchard, with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with fruit, proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the afternoon in it, sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared the green and the mellow autumn sunshine lingered warmly, eating apples and talking as hard as they could. Sophia had much to tell Clara of what went on in school. She had to sit with Heather Ford and she hated it; Gertie squeaked her pencil all the time and it just made her—Sophia’s—blood run cold; Coral Hayes had charmed all her warts away, true’s you live, with a magic pebble that old Grace Nigel from the Creek gave her. You had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw it away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the warts would all go. Jack Russell’s name was written up with Beau White’s on the porch wall and Beau White was awful mad about it; Frank Conner had “sassed” Mr. Edwards in class and Mr. Edwards whipped him and Sam’s father came down to the school and dared Mr. Edwards to lay a hand on one of his children again; and Linda Chapman had a new red hood and a blue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were perfectly sickening; and Nina Grant didn’t speak to Jenny McGee because Jenny McGee’s grown-up sister had cut out Nina Grant’s grown-up sister with her beau; and everybody missed Clara so and wished she’s come to school again; and Rowan Blake—\n\nBut Clara didn’t want to hear about Rowan Blake. She jumped up hurriedly and said suppose they go in and have some raspberry cordial.\n\nClara looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no bottle of raspberry cordial there. Search revealed it away back on the top shelf. Clara put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler.\n\n“Now, please help yourself, Sophia,” she said politely. “I don’t believe I’ll have any just now. I don’t feel as if I wanted any after all those apples.”\n\nSophia poured herself out a tumblerful, looked at its bright-red hue admiringly, and then sipped it daintily.\n\n“That’s awfully nice raspberry cordial, Clara,” she said. “I didn’t know raspberry cordial was so nice.”\n\n“I’m real glad you like it. Take as much as you want. I’m going to run out and stir the fire up. There are so many responsibilities on a person’s mind when they’re keeping house, isn’t there?”\n\nWhen Clara came back from the kitchen Sophia was drinking her second glassful of cordial; and, being entreated thereto by Clara, she offered no particular objection to the drinking of a third. The tumblerfuls were generous ones and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice.\n\n“The nicest I ever drank,” said Sophia. “It’s ever so much nicer than Mrs. Harper’s, although she brags of hers so much. It doesn’t taste a bit like hers.”\n\n“I should think Edna’s raspberry cordial would prob’ly be much nicer than Mrs. Harper’s,” said Clara loyally. “Edna is a famous cook. She is trying to teach me to cook but I assure you, Sophia, it is uphill work. There’s so little scope for imagination in cookery. You just have to go by rules. The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in. I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me, Sophia. I thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you, but I went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life; and then I took the smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears; and you never, never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you. Oh, it was such a pathetic tale, Sophia. The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake. But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure. Flour is so essential to cakes, you know. Edna was very cross and I don’t wonder. I’m a great trial to her. She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week. We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over. Edna said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it. I meant to cover it just as much as could be, Sophia, but when I carried it in I was imagining I was ",

He swung her out through the open window behind them, vaulted lightly over the sill and caught her hand.\n\n“Quick—we must run for it—they’ll be after us.”\n\nElara ran as she had never run before, clinging tight to Rowan’s hand, wondering why she did not drop dead in such a mad scamper. Suppose she did! What a scandal it would make for her poor people. For the first time Elara felt a little sorry for them. Also, she felt glad that she had escaped from that horrible row. Also, glad that she was holding tight to Rowan’s hand. Her feelings were badly mixed and she had never had so many in such a brief time in her life.\n\nThey finally reached a quiet corner in the pine woods. The pursuit had taken a different direction and the whoops and yells behind them were growing faint. Elara, out of breath, with a crazily beating heart, collapsed on the trunk of a fallen pine.\n\n“Thanks,” she gasped.\n\n“What a goose you were to come to such a place!” said Rowan.\n\n“I—didn’t—know—it—would—be like this,” protested Elara.\n\n“You should have known. Chidley Corners!”\n\n“It—was—just—a name—to me.”\n\nElara knew Rowan could not realise how ignorant she was of the regions “up back.” She had lived in Deerwood all her life and of course he supposed she knew. He didn’t know how she had been brought up. There was no use trying to explain.\n\n“When I drifted in at Thaddeus’s this evening and Mabel told me you’d come here I was amazed. And downright scared. Mabel told me she was worried about you but hadn’t liked to say anything to dissuade you for fear you’d think she was thinking selfishly about herself. So I came on up here instead of going to Deerwood.”\n\nElara felt a sudden delightful glow irradiating soul and body under the dark pines. So he had actually come up to look after her.\n\n“As soon as they stop hunting for us we’ll sneak around to the Muskoka road. I left Lady Cordelia down there. I’ll take you home. I suppose you’ve had enough of your party.”\n\n“Quite,” said Elara meekly. The first half of the way home neither of them said anything. It would not have been much use. Lady Cordelia made so much noise they could not have heard each other. Anyway, Elara did not feel conversationally inclined. She was ashamed of the whole affair—ashamed of her folly in going—ashamed of being found in such a place by Rowan Callister. By Rowan Callister, reputed jail-breaker, infidel, forger and defaulter. Elara’s lips twitched in the darkness as she thought of it. But she was ashamed.\n\nAnd yet she was enjoying herself—was full of a strange exultation—bumping over that rough road beside Rowan Callister. The big trees shot by them. The tall mulleins stood up along the road in stiff, orderly ranks like companies of soldiers. The thistles looked like drunken fairies or tipsy elves as their car-lights passed over them. This was the first time she had even been in a car. After all, she liked it. She was not in the least afraid, with Rowan at the wheel. Her spirits rose rapidly as they tore along. She ceased to feel ashamed. She ceased to feel anything except that she was part of a comet rushing gloriously through the night of space.\n\nAll at once, just where the pine woods frayed out to the scrub barrens, Lady Cordelia became quiet—too quiet. Lady Cordelia slowed down quietly—and stopped.\n\nRowan uttered an aghast exclamation. Got out. Investigated. Came apologetically back.\n\n“I’m a doddering idiot. Out of gas. I knew I was short when I left home, but I meant to fill up in Deerwood. Then I forgot all about it in my hurry to get to the Corners.”\n\n“What can we do?” asked Elara coolly.\n\n“I don’t know. There’s no gas nearer than Deerwood, nine miles away. And I don’t dare leave you here alone. There are always tramps on this road—and some of those crazy fools back at the Corners may come straggling along presently. There were boys there from the Port. As far as I can see, the best thing to do is for us just to sit patiently here until some car comes along and lends us enough gas to get to Thaddeus Greeley’s with.”\n\n“Well, what’s the matter with that?” said Elara.\n\n“We may have to sit here all night,” said Rowan.\n\n“I don’t mind,” said Elara.\n\nRowan gave a short laugh. “If you don’t, I needn’t. I haven’t any reputation to lose.”\n\n“Nor I,” said Elara comfortably.\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n“We’ll just sit here,” said Rowan, “and if we think of anything worth while saying we’ll say it. Otherwise, not. Don’t imagine you’re bound to talk to me.”\n\n“Ian Rowlston says,” quoted Elara, “‘If you can sit in silence with a person for half an hour and yet be entirely comfortable, you and that person can be friends. If you cannot, friends you’ll never be and you need not waste time in trying.’”\n\n“Evidently Ian Rowlston says a sensible thing once in a while,” conceded Rowan.\n\nThey sat in silence for a long while. Little rabbits hopped across the road. Once or twice an owl laughed out delightfully. The road beyond them was fringed with the woven shadow lace of trees. Away off to the southwest the sky was full of silvery little cirrus clouds above the spot where Rowan’s island must be.\n\nElara was perfectly happy. Some things dawn on you slowly. Some things come by lightning flashes. Elara had had a lightning flash.\n\nShe knew quite well now that she loved Rowan. Yesterday she had been all her own. Now she was this man’s. Yet he had done nothing—said nothing. He had not even looked at her as a woman. But that didn’t matter. Nor did it matter what he was or what he had done. She loved him without any reservations. Everything in her went out wholly to him. She had no wish to stifle or disown her love. She seemed to be his so absolutely that thought apart from him—thought in which he did not predominate—was an impossibility.\n\nShe had realised, quite simply and fully, that she loved him, in the moment when he was leaning on the car door, explaining that Lady Cordelia had no gas. She had looked deep into his eyes in the moonlight and had known. In just that infinitesimal space of time everything was changed. Old things passed away and all things became new.\n\nShe was no longer unimportant, little, old maid Elara Finch. She was a woman, full of love and therefore rich and significant—justified to herself. Life was no longer empty and futile, and death could cheat her of nothing. Love had cast out her last fear.\n\nLove! What a searing, torturing, intolerably sweet thing it was—this possession of body, soul and mind! With something at its core as fine and remote and purely spiritual as the tiny blue spark in the heart of the unbreakable diamond. No dream had ever been like this. She was no longer solitary. She was one of a vast sisterhood—all the women who had ever loved in the world.\n\nRowan need never know it—though she would not in the least have minded his knowing. But she knew it and it made a tremendous difference to her. Just to love! She did not ask to be loved. It was rapture enough just to sit there beside him in silence, alone in the summer night in the white splendour of moonshine, with the wind blowing down on them out of the pine woods. She had always envied the wind. So free. Blowing where it listed. Through the hills. Over the lakes. What a tang, what a zip it had! What a magic of adventure! Elara felt as if she had exchanged her shop-worn soul for a fresh one, fire-new from the workshop of the gods. As far back as she could look, life had been dull—colourless—savourless. Now she had come to a little patch of violets, purple and fragrant—hers for the plucking. No matter who or what had been in Rowan’s past—no matter who or what might be in his future—no one else could ever have this perfect hour. She surrendered herself utterly to the charm of the moment.\n\n“Ever dream of ballooning?” said Rowan suddenly.\n\n“No,” said Elara.\n\n“I do—often. Dream of sailing through the clouds—seeing the glories of sunset—spending hours in the midst of a terrific storm with lightning playing above and below you—skimming above a silver cloud floor under a full moon—wonderful!”\n\n“It does sound so,” said Elara. “I’ve stayed on earth in my dreams.”\n\nShe told him about her Blue Castle. It was so easy to tell Rowan things. One felt he understood everything—even the things you didn’t tell him. And then she told him a little of her existence before she came to Thaddeus Greeley’s. She wanted him to see why she had gone to the dance “up back.”\n\n“You see—I’ve never had any real life,” she said. “I’ve just—breathed. Every door has always been shut to me.”\n\n“But you’re still young,” said Rowan.\n\n“Oh, I know. Yes, I’m ‘still young’—but that’s so different from young,” said Elara bitterly. For a moment she was tempted to tell Rowan why her years had nothing to do with her future; but she did not. She was not going to think of death tonight.\n\n“Though I never was really young,” she went on—“until tonight,” she added in her heart. “I never had a life like other girls. You couldn’t understand. Why,”—she had a desperate desire that Rowan should know the worst about her—“I didn’t even love my mother. Isn’t it awful that I don’t love my mother?”\n\n“Rather awful—for her,” said Rowan drily.\n\n“Oh, she didn’t know it. She took my love for granted. And I wasn’t any use or comfort to her or anybody. I was just a—a—vegetable. And I got tired of it. That’s why I came to keep house for Mr. Greeley and look after Mabel.”\n\n“And I suppose your people thought you’d gone mad.”\n\n“They did—and do—literally,” said Elara. “But it’s a comfort to them. They’d rather believe me mad than bad. There’s no other alternative. But I’ve been living since I came to Mr. Greeley’s. It’s been a delightful experience. I suppose I’ll pay for it when I have to go back—but I’ll have had it.”\n\n“That’s true,” said Rowan. “If you buy your experience it’s your own. So it’s no matter how much you pay for it. Somebody else’s experience can never be yours. Well, it’s a funny old world.”\n\n“Do you think it really is old?” asked Elara dreamily. “I never believe that in June. It seems so young tonight—somehow. In that quivering moonlight—like a young, white girl—waiting.”\n\n“Moonlight here on the verge of up back is different from moonlight anywhere else,” agreed Rowan. “It always makes me feel so clean, somehow—body and soul. And of course the age of gold always comes back in spring.”\n\nIt was ten o’clock now. A dragon of black cloud ate up the moon. The spring air grew chill—Elara shivered. Rowan reached back into the innards of Lady Cordelia and clawed up an old, tobacco-scented overcoat.\n\n“Put that on,” he ordered.\n\n“Don’t you want it yourself?” protested Elara.\n\n“No. I’m not going to have you catching cold on my hands.”\n\n“Oh, I won’t catch cold. I haven’t had a cold since I came to Mr. Greeley’s—though I’ve done the foolishest things. It’s funny, too—I used to have them all the time. I feel so selfish taking your coat.”\n\n“You’ve sneezed three times. No use winding up your ‘experience’ up back with grippe or pneumonia.”\n\nHe pulled it up tight about her throat and buttoned it on her. Elara submitted with secret delight. How nice it was to have some one look after you so! She snuggled down into the tobaccoey folds and wished the night could last forever.\n\nTen minutes later a car swooped down on them from “up back.” Rowan sprang from Lady Cordelia and waved his hand. The car came to a stop beside them. Elara saw Uncle Jasper and Isla gazing at her in horror from it.\n\nSo Uncle Jasper had got a car! And he must have been spending the evening up at Mistawis with Cousin Rufus. Elara almost laughed aloud at the expression on his face as he recognised her. The pompous, bewhiskered old humbug!\n\n“Can you let me have enough gas to take me to Deerwood?” Rowan was asking politely. But Uncle Jasper was not attending to him.\n\n“Elara, how came you here!” he said sternly.\n\n“By chance or God’s grace,” said Elara.\n\n“With this jail-bird—at ten o’clock at night!” said Uncle Jasper.\n\nElara turned to Rowan. The moon had escaped from its dragon and in its light her eyes were full of deviltry.\n\n“Are you a jail-bird?”\n\n“Does it matter?” said Rowan, gleams of fun in his eyes.\n\n“Not to me. I only asked out of curiosity,” continued Elara.\n\n“Then I won’t tell you. I never satisfy curiosity.” He turned to Uncle Jasper and his voice changed subtly.\n\n“Mr. Stirling, I asked you if you could let me have some gas. If you can, well and good. If not, we are only delaying you unnecessarily.”\n\nUncle Jasper was in a horrible dilemma. To give gas to this shameless pair! But not to give it to them! To go away and leave them there in the Mistawis woods—until daylight, likely. It was better to give it to them and let them get out of sight before any one else saw them.\n\n“Got anything to get gas in?” he grunted surlily.\n\nRowan produced a two-gallon measure from Lady Cordelia. The two men went to the rear of the Stirling car and began manipulating the tap. Elara stole sly glances at Isla over the collar of Rowan’s coat. Isla was sitting grimly staring straight ahead with an outraged expression. She did not mean to take any notice of Elara. Isla had her own secret reasons for feeling outraged. Corwin had been in Deerwood lately and of course had heard all about Elara. He agreed that her mind was deranged and was exceedingly anxious to find out whence the derangement had been inherited. It was a serious thing to have in the family—a very serious thing. One had to think of one’s—descendants.\n\n“She got it from the Wansbarras,” said Isla positively. “There’s nothing like that in the Stirlings—nothing!”\n\n“I hope not—I certainly hope not,” Corwin had responded dubiously. “But then—to go out as a servant—for that is what it practically amounts to. Your cousin!”\n\nPoor Isla felt the implication. The Port Lawrence Prices were not accustomed to ally themselves with families whose members “worked out.”\n\nElara could not resist temptation. She leaned forward.\n\n“Isla, does it hurt?”\n\nIsla bit—stiffly.\n\n“Does what hurt?”\n\n“Looking like that.”\n\nFor a moment Isla resolved she would take no further notice of Elara. Then duty came uppermost. She must not miss the opportunity.\n\n“El,” she implored, leaning forward also, “won’t you come home—come home tonight?”\n\nElara yawned.\n\n“You sound like a revival meeting,” she said. “You really do.”\n\n“If you will come back——”\n\n“All will be forgiven.”\n\n“Yes,” said Isla eagerly. Wouldn’t it be splendid if she could induce the prodigal daughter to return? “We’ll never cast it up to you. El, there are nights when I cannot sleep for thinking of you.”\n\n“And me having the time of my life,” said Elara, laughing.\n\n“El, I can’t believe you’re bad. I’ve always said you couldn’t be bad——”\n\n“I don’t believe I can be,” said Elara. “I’m afraid I’m hopelessly proper. I’ve been sitting here for three hours with Rowan Callister and he hasn’t even tried to kiss me. I wouldn’t have minded if he had, Isla.”\n\nElara was still leaning forward. Her little hat with its crimson rose was tilted down over one eye. Isla stared. In the moonlight Elara’s eyes—Elara’s smile—what had happened to Elara! She looked—not pretty—El couldn’t be pretty—but provocative, fascinating—yes, abominably so. Isla drew back. It was beneath her dignity to say more. After all, Elara must be both mad and bad.\n\n“Thanks—that’s enough,” said Rowan behind the car. “Much obliged, Mr. Stirling. Two gallons—seventy cents. Thank you.”\n\nUncle Jasper climbed foolishly and feebly into his car. He wanted to give Callister a piece of his mind, but dared not. Who knew what the creature might do if provoked? No doubt he carried firearms.\n\nUncle Jasper looked indecisively at Elara. But Elara had turned her back on him and was watching Rowan pour the gas into Lady Cordelia’s maw.\n\n“Drive on,” said Isla decisively. “There’s no use in waiting here. Let me tell you what she said to me.”\n\n“The little hussy! The shameless little hussy!” said Uncle Jasper.\n\nCHAPTER XXII\nThe next thing the Stirlings heard was that Elara had been seen with Rowan Callister in a movie theatre in Port Lawrence and after it at supper in a Chinese restaurant there. This was quite true—and no one was more surprised at it than Elara herself. Rowan had come along in Lady Cordelia one dim twilight and told Elara unceremoniously if she wanted a drive to hop in.\n\n“I’m going to the Port. Will you go there with me?”\n\nHis eyes were teasing and there was a bit of defiance in his voice. Elara, who did not conceal from herself that she would have gone anywhere with him to any place, “hopped in” without more ado. They tore into and through Deerwood. Mrs. Octavia and Cousin Thistle, taking a little air on the verandah, saw them whirl by in a cloud of dust and sought comfort in each other’s eyes. Elara, who in some dim pre-existence had been afraid of a car, was hatless and her hair was blowing wildly round her face. She would certainly come down with bronchitis—and die at Thaddeus Greeley’s. She wore a low-necked dress and her arms were bare. That Callister creature was in his shirt-sleeves, smoking a pipe. They were going at the rate of forty miles an hour—sixty, Cousin Thistle averred. Lady Cordelia could hit the pike when she wanted to. Elara waved her hand gaily to her relatives. As for Mrs. Octavia, she was wishing she knew how to go into hysterics.\n\n“Was it for this,” she demanded in hollow tones, “that I suffered the pangs of motherhood?”\n\n“I will not believe,” said Cousin Thistle solemnly, “that our prayers will not yet be answered.”\n\n“Who—who will protect that unfortunate girl when I am gone?” moaned Mrs. Octavia.\n\nAs for Elara, she was wondering if it could really be only a few weeks since she had sat there with them on that verandah. Hating the rubber-plant. Pestered with teasing questions like black flies. Always thinking of appearances. Cowed because of Aunt Juniper’s teaspoons and Uncle Eldridge’s money. Poverty-stricken. Afraid of everybody. Envying Isla. A slave to moth-eaten traditions. Nothing to hope for or expect.\n\nAnd now every day was a gay adventure.\n\nLady Cordelia flew over the fifteen miles between Deerwood and the Port—through the Port. The way Rowan went past traffic policemen was not holy. The lights were beginning to twinkle out like stars in the clear, lemon-hued twilight air. This was the only time Elara ever really liked the town, and she was crazy with the delight of speeding. Was it possible she had ever been afraid of a car? She was perfectly happy, riding beside Rowan. Not that she deluded herself into thinking it had any significance. She knew quite well that Rowan had asked her to go on the impulse of the moment—an impulse born of a feeling of pity for her and her starved little dreams. She was looking tired after a wakeful night with a heart attack, followed by a busy day. She had so little fun. He’d give her an outing for once. Besides, Thaddeus was in the kitchen, at the point of drunkenness where he was declaring he did not believe in God and beginning to sing ribald songs. It was just as well she should be out of the way for a while. Rowan knew Thaddeus Greeley’s repertoire.\n\nThey went to the movie—Elara had never been to a movie. And then, finding a nice hunger upon them, they went and had fried chicken—unbelievably delicious—in the Chinese restaurant. After which they rattled home again, leaving a devastating trail of scandal behind them. Mrs. Octavia gave up going to church altogether. She could not endure her friends’ pitying glances and questions. But Cousin Thistle went every Sunday. She said they had been given a cross to bear.\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\nOn one of Mabel’s wakeful nights, she told Elara her poor little story. They were sitting by the open window. Mabel could not get her breath lying down that night. An inglorious gibbous moon was hanging over the wooded hills and in its spectral light Mabel looked frail and lovely and incredibly young. A child. It did not seem possible that she could have lived through all the passion and pain and shame of her story.\n\n“He was stopping at the hotel across the lake. He used to come over in his canoe at night—we met in the pines down the shore. He was a young college student—his father was a rich man in Toronto. Oh, Elara, I didn’t mean to be bad—I didn’t, indeed. But I loved him so—I love him yet—I’ll always love him. And I—didn’t know—some things. I didn’t—understand. Then his father came and took him away. And—after a little—I found out—oh, Elara,—I was so frightened. I didn’t know what to do. I wrote him—and he came. He—he said he would marry me, Elara.”\n\n“And why—and why?——”\n\n“Oh, Elara, he didn’t love me any more. I saw that at a glance. He—he was just offering to marry me because he thought he ought to—because he was sorry for me. He wasn’t bad—but he was so young—and what was I that he should keep on loving me?”\n\n“Never mind making excuses for him,” said Elara a bit shortly. “So you wouldn’t marry him?”\n\n“I couldn’t—not when he didn’t love me any more. Somehow—I can’t explain—it seemed a worse thing to do than—the other. He—he argued a little—but he went away. Do you think I did right, Elara?”\n\n“Yes, I do. You did right. But he——”\n\n“Don’t blame him, dear. Please don’t. Let’s not talk about him at all. There’s no need. I wanted to tell you how it was—I didn’t want you to think me bad——”\n\n“I never did think so.”\n\n“Yes, I felt that—whenever you came. Oh, Elara, what you’ve been to me! I can never tell you—but God will bless you for it. I know He will—‘with what measure ye mete.’”\n\nMabel sobbed for a few minutes in Elara’s arms. Then she wiped her eyes.\n\n“Well, that’s almost all. I came home. I wasn’t really so very unhappy. I suppose I should have been—but I wasn’t. Patron wasn’t hard on me. And my baby was so sweet while he lived. I was even happy—I loved him so much, the dear little thing. He was so sweet, Elara—with such lovely blue eyes—and little rings of pale gold hair like silk floss—and tiny dimpled hands. I used to bite his satin-smooth little face all over—softly, so as not to hurt him, you know——”\n\n“I know,” said Elara, wincing. “I know—a woman always knows—and dreams——”\n\n“And he was all mine. Nobody else had any claim on him. When he died, oh, Elara, I thought I must die too—I didn’t see how anybody could endure such anguish and live. To see his dear little eyes and know he would never open them again—to miss his warm little body nestled against mine at night and think of him sleeping alone and cold, his wee face under the hard frozen earth. It was so awful for the first year—after that it was a little easier, one didn’t keep thinking ‘this day last year’—but I was so glad when I found out I was dying.”\n\n“‘Who could endure life if it were not for the hope of death?’” murmured Elara softly—it was of course a quotation from some book of Ian Rowlston’s.\n\n“I’m glad I’ve told you all about it,” sighed Mabel. “I wanted you to know.”\n\nMabel died a few nights after that. Thaddeus Greeley was away. When Elara saw the change that had come over Mabel’s face she wanted to telephone for the doctor. But Mabel wouldn’t let her.\n\n“Elara, why should you? He can do nothing for me. I’ve known for several days that—this—was near. Let me die in peace, dear—just holding your hand. Oh, I’m so glad you’re here. Tell Patron good-bye for me. He’s always been as good to me as he knew how—and Rowan. Somehow, I think that Rowan——”\n\nBut a spasm of coughing interrupted and exhausted her. She fell asleep when it was over, still holding to Elara’s hand. Elara sat there in the silence. She was not frightened—or even sorry. At sunrise Mabel died. She opened her eyes and looked past Elara at something—something that made her smile suddenly and happily. And, smiling, she died.\n\nElara crossed Mabel’s hands on her breast and went to the open window. In the eastern sky, amid the fires of sunrise, an old moon was hanging—as slender and lovely as a new moon. Elara had never seen an old, old moon before. She watched it pale and fade until it paled and faded out of sight in the living rose of day. A little pool in the barrens shone in the sunrise like a great golden lily.\n\nBut the world suddenly seemed a colder place to Elara. Again nobody needed her. She was not in the least sorry Corwinia was dead. She was only sorry for all her suffering in life. But nobody could ever hurt her again. Elara had always thought death dreadful. But Mabel had died so quietly—so pleasantly. And at the very last—something—had made up to her for everything. She was lying there now, in her white sleep, looking like a child. Beautiful! All the lines of shame and pain gone.\n\nThaddeus Greeley drove in, justifying his name. Elara went down and told him. The shock sobered him at once. He slumped down on the seat of his buggy, his great head hanging.\n\n“Mabel dead—Mabel dead,” he said vacantly. “I didn’t think it would ‘a’ come so soon. Dead. She used to run down the lane to meet me with a little white rose stuck in her hair. Mabel used to be a pretty little girl. And a good little girl.”\n\n“She has always been a good little girl,” said Elara.\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\nElara herself made Mabel ready for burial. No hands but hers should touch that pitiful, wasted little body. The old house was spotless on the day of the funeral. Rowan Callister was not there. He had done all he could to help Elara before it—he had shrouded the pale Corwinia in white roses from the garden—and then had gone back to his island. But everybody else was there. All Deerwood and “up back” came. They forgave Mabel splendidly at last. Mr. Sutton gave a very beautiful funeral address. Elara had wanted her old Free Methodist man, but Thaddeus Greeley was obdurate. He was a Presbyterian and no one but a Presbyterian minister should bury his daughter. Mr. Sutton was very tactful. He avoided all dubious points and it was plain to be seen he hoped for the best. Six reputable citizens of Deerwood bore Mabel Greeley to her grave in decorous Deerwood cemetery. Among them was Uncle Jasper.\n\nThe Stirlings all came to the funeral, men and women. They had had a family conclave over it. Surely now that Mabel Greeley was dead Elara would come home. She simply could not stay there with Thaddeus Greeley. That being the case, the wisest course—decreed Uncle Vernon—was to attend the funeral—legitimise the whole thing, so to speak—show Deerwood that Elara had really done a most creditable deed in going to nurse poor Mabel Greeley and that her family backed her up in it. Death, the miracle worker, suddenly made the thing quite respectable. If Elara would return to home and decency while public opinion was under its influence all might yet be well. Society was suddenly forgetting all Corwinia’s wicked doings and remembering what a pretty, modest little thing she had been—“and motherless, you know—motherless!” It was the psychological moment—said Uncle Vernon.\n\nSo the Stirlings went to the funeral. Even Cousin Hattie’ neuritis allowed her to come. Cousin Thistle was there, her bonnet dripping all over her face, crying as woefully as if Mabel had been her nearest and dearest. Funerals always brought Cousin Thistle’ “own sad bereavement” back.\n\nAnd Uncle Jasper was a pall-bearer.\n\nElara, pale, subdued-looking, her slanted eyes smudged with purple, in her snuff-brown dress, moving quietly about, finding seats for people, consulting in undertones with minister and undertaker, marshalling the “mourners” into the parlour, was so decorous and proper and Stirlingish that her family took heart of grace. This was not—could not be—the girl who had sat all night in the woods with Rowan Callister—who had gone tearing bareheaded through Deerwood and Port Lawrence. This was the Elara they knew. Really, surprisingly capable and efficient. Perhaps she had always been kept down a bit too much—Vera really was rather strict—hadn’t had a chance to show what was in her. So thought the Stirlings. And Samuel Hayes, from the Port road, a widower with a large family who was beginning to take notice, took notice of Elara and thought she might make a mighty fine second wife. No beauty—but a fifty-year-old widower, Mr. Beck told himself very reasonably, couldn’t expect everything. Altogether, it seemed that Elara’s matrimonial chances were never so bright as they were at Mabel Greeley’s funeral.\n\nWhat the Stirlings and Samuel Hayes would have thought had they known the back of Elara’s mind must be left to the imagination. Elara was hating the funeral—hating the people who came to stare with curiosity at Corwinia’s marble-white face—hating the smugness—hating the dragging, melancholy singing—hating Mr. Sutton’s cautious platitudes. If she could have had her absurd way, there would have been no funeral at all. She would have covered Mabel over with flowers, shut her away from prying eyes, and buried her beside her nameless little baby in the grassy burying-ground under the pines of the “up back” church, with a bit of kindly prayer from the old Free Methodist minister. She remembered Mabel saying once, “I wish I could be buried deep in the heart of the woods where nobody would ever come to say, ‘Mabel Greeley is buried here,’ and tell over my miserable story.”\n\nBut this! However, it would soon be over. Elara knew, if the Stirlings and Samuel Hayes didn’t, exactly what she intended to do then. She had lain awake all the preceding night thinking about it and finally deciding on it.\n\nWhen the funeral procession had left the house, Mrs. Octavia sought out Elara in the kitchen.\n\n“My child,” she said tremulously, “you’ll come home now?”\n\n“Home,” said Elara absently. She was getting on an apron and calculating how much tea she must put to steep for supper. There would be several guests from “up back”—distant relatives of the Gays’ who had not remembered them for years. And she was so tired she wished she could borrow a pair of legs from the cat.\n\n“Yes, home,” said Mrs. Octavia, with a touch of asperity. “I suppose you won’t dream of staying here now—alone with Thaddeus Greeley.”\n\n“Oh, no, I’m not going to stay here,” said Elara. “Of course, I’ll have to stay for a day or two, to put the house in order generally. But that will be all. Excuse me, Matron, won’t you? I’ve a frightful lot to do—all those “up back” people will be here to supper.”\n\nMrs. Octavia retreated in considerable relief, and the Stirlings went home with lighter hearts.\n\n“We will just treat her as if nothing had happened when she comes back,” decreed Uncle Eldridge. “That will be the best plan. Just as if nothing had happened.”\n\nCHAPTER XXV\nOn the evening of the day after the funeral Thaddeus Greeley went off for a spree. He had been sober for four whole days and could endure it no longer. Before he went, Elara told him she would be going away the next day. Thaddeus Greeley was sorry, and said so. A distant cousin from “up back” was coming to keep house for him—quite willing to do so now since there was no sick girl to wait on—but Thaddeus was not under any delusions concerning her.\n\n“She won’t be like you, my girl. Well, I’m obliged to you. You helped me out of a bad hole and I won’t forget it. And I won’t forget what you did for Mabel. I’m your friend, and if you ever want any of the Stirlings spanked and sot in a corner send for me. I’m going to wet my whistle. Lord, but I’m dry! Don’t reckon I’ll be back afore tomorrow night, so if you’re going home tomorrow, good-bye now.”\n\n“I may go home tomorrow,” said Elara, “but I’m not going back to Deerwood.”\n\n“Not going——”\n\n“You’ll find the key on the woodshed nail,” interrupted Elara, politely and unmistakably. “The dog will be in the barn and the cat in the cellar. Don’t forget to feed her till your cousin comes. The pantry is full and I made bread and pies today. Good-bye, Mr. Greeley. You have been very kind to me and I appreciate it.”\n\n“We’ve had a d——d decent time of it together, and that’s a fact,” said Thaddeus Greeley. “You’re the best small sport in the world, and your little finger is worth the whole Stirling clan tied together. Good-bye and good-luck.”\n\nElara went out to the garden. Her legs trembled a little, but otherwise she felt and looked composed. She held something tightly in her hand. The garden was lying in the magic of the warm, odorous July twilight. A few stars were out and the robins were calling through the velvety silences of the barrens. Elara stood by the gate expectantly. Would he come? If he did not——\n\nHe was coming. Elara heard Lady Cordelia Grey far back in the woods. Her breath came a little more quickly. Nearer—and nearer—she could see Lady Cordelia now—bumping down the lane—nearer—nearer—he was there—he had sprung from the car and was leaning over the gate, looking at her.\n\n“Going home, Miss Stirling?”\n\n“I don’t know—yet,” said Elara slowly. Her mind was made up, with no shadow of turning, but the moment was very tremendous.\n\n“I thought I’d run down and ask if there was anything I could do for you,” said Rowan.\n\nElara took it with a canter.\n\n“Yes, there is something you can do for me,” she said, evenly and distinctly. “Will you marry me?”\n\nFor a moment Rowan was silent. There was no particular expression on his face. Then he gave an odd laugh.\n\n“Come, now! I knew luck was just waiting around the corner for me. All the signs have been pointing that way today.”\n\n“Wait.” Elara lifted her hand. “I’m in earnest—but I want to get my breath after that question. Of course, with my bringing up, I realise perfectly well that this is one of the things ‘a lady should not do.’”\n\n“But why—why?”\n\n“For two reasons.” Elara was still a little breathless, but she looked Rowan straight in the eyes, while all the dead Stirlings revolved rapidly in their graves and the living ones did nothing because they did not know that Elara was at that moment proposing lawful marriage to the notorious Rowan Callister. “The first reason is, I—I”—Elara tried to say “I love you” but could not. She had to take refuge in a pretended flippancy. “I’m crazy about you. The second is—this.”\n\nShe handed him Dr. Larkin’s letter.\n\nRowan opened it with the air of a man thankful to find some safe, sane thing to do. As he read it his face changed. He understood—more perhaps than Elara wanted him to.\n\n“Are you sure nothing can be done for you?”\n\nElara did not misunderstand the question.\n\n“Yes. You know Dr. Larkin’s reputation in regard to heart disease. I haven’t long to live—perhaps only a few months—a few weeks. I want to live them. I can’t go back to Deerwood—you know what my life was like there. And”—she managed it this time—“I love you. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. That’s all.”\n\nRowan folded his arms on the gate and looked gravely enough at a white, saucy star that was winking at him just over Thaddeus Greeley’s kitchen chimney.\n\n“You don’t know anything about me. I may be a—murderer.”\n\n“No, I don’t. You may be something dreadful. Everything they say of you may be true. But it doesn’t matter to me.”\n\n“You care that much for me, Elara?” said Rowan incredulously, looking away from the star and into her eyes—her strange, mysterious eyes.\n\n“I care—that much,” said Elara in a low voice. She was trembling. He had called her by her name for the first time. It was sweeter than another man’s caress could have been just to hear him say her name like that.\n\n“If we are going to get married,” said Rowan, speaking suddenly in a casual, matter-of-fact voice, “some things must be understood.”\n\n“Everything must be understood,” said Elara.\n\n“I have things I want to hide,” said Rowan coolly. “You are not to ask me about them.”\n\n“I won’t,” said Elara.\n\n“You must never ask to see my mail.”\n\n“Never.”\n\n“And we are never to pretend anything to each other.”\n\n“We won’t,” said Elara. “You won’t even have to pretend you like me. If you marry me I know you’re only doing it out of pity.”\n\n“And we’ll never tell a lie to each other about anything—a big lie or a petty lie.”\n\n“Especially a petty lie,” agreed Elara.\n\n“And you’ll have to live back on my island. I won’t live anywhere else.”\n\n“That’s partly why I want to marry you,” said Elara.\n\nRowan peered at her.\n\n“I believe you mean it. Well—let’s get married, then.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Elara, with a sudden return of primness. She would have been much less embarrassed if he had refused her.\n\n“I suppose I haven’t any right to make conditions. But I’m going to make one. You are never to refer to my heart or my liability to sudden death. You are never to urge me to be careful. You are to forget—absolutely forget—that I’m not perfectly healthy. I have written a letter to my mother—here it is—you are to keep it. I have explained everything in it. If I drop dead suddenly—as I likely will do——”\n\n“It will exonerate me in the eyes of your kindred from the suspicion of having poisoned you,” said Rowan with a grin.\n\n“Exactly.” Elara laughed gaily. “Dear me, I’m glad this is over. It has been—a bit of an ordeal. You see, I’m not in the habit of going about asking men to marry me. It is so nice of you not to refuse me—or offer to be a brother!”\n\n“I’ll go to the Port tomorrow and get a license. We can be married tomorrow evening. Dr. Hawthorne, I suppose?”\n\n“Heavens, no.” Elara shuddered. “Besides, he wouldn’t do it. He’d shake his forefinger at me and I’d jilt you at the altar. No, I want my old Mr. Langley to marry me.”\n\n“Will you marry me as I stand?” demanded Rowan. A passing car, full of tourists, honked loudly—it seemed derisively. Elara looked at him. Blue homespun shirt, nondescript hat, muddy overalls. Unshaved!\n\n“Yes,” she said.\n\nRowan put his hands over the gate and took her little, cold ones gently in his.\n\n“Elara,” he said, trying to speak lightly, “of course I’m not in love with you—never thought of such a thing as being in love. But, do you know, I’ve always thought you were a bit of a dear.”\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\nThe next day passed for Elara like a dream. She could not make herself or anything she did seem real. She saw nothing of Rowan, though she expected he must go rattling past on his way to the Port for a license.\n\nPerhaps he had changed his mind.\n\nBut at dusk the lights of Lady Cordelia suddenly swooped over the crest of the wooded hill beyond the lane. Elara was waiting at the gate for her bridegroom. She wore her green dress and her green hat because she had nothing else to wear. She did not look o",

She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature:—\n\n“Oh! dear! very true. Only think, Miss Langley, to my great surprise I met with Mr Langley in Bath Street. I was never more astonished. He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard. He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return. He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow. He was full of ‘to-morrow,’ and it is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head.”\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\nOne day only had passed since Clara’s conversation with Mrs Johnson; but a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched by Mr Langley’s conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street. She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner. Her faith was plighted, and Mr Langley’s character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade’s head, must live another day.\n\nShe could not keep her appointment punctually, however; the weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain on her friends’ account, and felt it very much on her own, before she was able to attempt the walk. When she reached the White Hart, and made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself neither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive. The party before her were, Mrs Broughton, talking to Mrs Sutherland, and Captain Kingston to Captain Hawthorne; and she immediately heard that Diana and Evelyn, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Broughton to keep her there till they returned. She had only to submit, sit down, be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed. There was no delay, no waste of time. She was deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such happiness, instantly. Two minutes after her entering the room, Captain Hawthorne said—\n\n“We will write the letter we were talking of, Kingston, now, if you will give me materials.”\n\nMaterials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it, and nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.\n\nMrs Broughton was giving Mrs Sutherland the history of her eldest daughter’s engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper. Clara felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Kingston seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as, “how Mr Broughton and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day, and what Mr Broughton had proposed the next, and what had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well,” and a great deal in the same style of open-hearted communication: minutiae which, even with every advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Broughton could not give, could be properly interesting only to the principals. Mrs Sutherland was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, it was very sensibly. Clara hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self-occupied to hear.\n\n“And so, ma’am, all these thing considered,” said Mrs Broughton, in her powerful whisper, “though we could have wished it different, yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for Edmund Carlton was quite wild about it, and Evelyn was pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the best of it, as many others have done before them. At any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement.”\n\n“That is precisely what I was going to observe,” cried Mrs Sutherland. “I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved in a long engagement. I always think that no mutual—”\n\n“Oh! dear Mrs Sutherland,” cried Mrs Broughton, unable to let her finish her speech, “there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement. It is what I always protested against for my children. It is all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement—”\n\n“Yes, dear ma’am,” said Mrs Sutherland, “or an uncertain engagement, an engagement which may be long. To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can.”\n\nClara found an unexpected interest here. She felt its application to herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table, Captain Hawthorne’s pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing, listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look, one quick, conscious look at her.\n\nThe two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths, and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation, but Clara heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear, her mind was in confusion.\n\nCaptain Kingston, who had in truth been hearing none of it, now left his seat, and moved to a window, and Clara seeming to watch him, though it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood. He looked at her with a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, “Come to me, I have something to say;” and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation. She roused herself and went to him. The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer to Captain Hawthorne’s table, not very near. As she joined him, Captain Kingston’s countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character.\n\n“Look here,” said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying a small miniature painting, “do you know who that is?”\n\n“Certainly: Captain Collins.”\n\n“Yes, and you may guess who it is for. But,” (in a deep tone), “it was not done for her. Miss Langley, do you remember our walking together at Lyme, and grieving for him? I little thought then—but no matter. This was drawn at the Cape. He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another! It was a commission to me! But who else was there to employ? I hope I can allow for him. I am not sorry, indeed, to make it over to another. He undertakes it;” (looking towards Captain Hawthorne,) “he is writing about it now.” And with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding, “Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!”\n\n“No,” replied Clara, in a low, feeling voice. “That I can easily believe.”\n\n“It was not in her nature. She doted on him.”\n\n“It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.”\n\nCaptain Kingston smiled, as much as to say, “Do you claim that for your sex?” and she answered the question, smiling also, “Yes. We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us. It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit. We cannot help ourselves. We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.”\n\n“Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men (which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply to Collins. He has not been forced upon any exertion. The peace turned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us, in our little family circle, ever since.”\n\n“True,” said Clara, “very true; I did not recollect; but what shall we say now, Captain Kingston? If the change be not from outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man’s nature, which has done the business for Captain Collins.”\n\n“No, no, it is not man’s nature. I will not allow it to be more man’s nature than woman’s to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or have loved. I believe the reverse. I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage, and riding out the heaviest weather.”\n\n“Your feelings may be the strongest,” replied Clara, “but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender. Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments. Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise. You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with. You are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship. Your home, country, friends, all quitted. Neither time, nor health, nor life, to be called your own. It would be hard, indeed” (with a faltering voice), “if woman’s feelings were to be added to all this.”\n\n“We shall never agree upon this question,” Captain Kingston was beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention to Captain Hawthorne’s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room. It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Clara was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think he could have caught.\n\n“Have you finished your letter?” said Captain Kingston.\n\n“Not quite, a few lines more. I shall have done in five minutes.”\n\n“There is no hurry on my side. I am only ready whenever you are. I am in very good anchorage here,” (smiling at Clara), “well supplied, and want for nothing. No hurry for a signal at all. Well, Miss Langley,” (lowering his voice), “as I was saying, we shall never agree, I suppose, upon this point. No man and woman would, probably. But let me observe that all histories are against you—all stories, prose and verse. If I had such a memory as Collins, I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman’s inconstancy. Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman’s fickleness. But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.”\n\n“Perhaps I shall. Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in books. Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything.”\n\n“But how shall we prove anything?”\n\n“We never shall. We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point. It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof. We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some respect saying what should not be said.”\n\n“Ah!” cried Captain Kingston, in a tone of strong feeling, “if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat that he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, ‘God knows whether we ever meet again!’ And then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth’s absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself, and saying, ‘They cannot be here till such a day,’ but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still! If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence! I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!” pressing his own with emotion.\n\n“Oh!” cried Clara eagerly, “I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you, and by those who resemble you. God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman. No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives. I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance, so long as—if I may be allowed the expression—so long as you have an object. I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you. All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.”\n\nShe could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart was too full, her breath too much oppressed.\n\n“You are a good soul,” cried Captain Kingston, putting his hand on her arm, quite affectionately. “There is no quarrelling with you. And when I think of Collins, my tongue is tied.”\n\nTheir attention was called towards the others. Mrs Sutherland was taking leave.\n\n“Here, Robert, you and I part company, I believe,” said she. “I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend. To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,” (turning to Clara). “We had your sister’s card yesterday, and I understood Robert had a card too, though I did not see it; and you are disengaged, Robert, are you not, as well as ourselves?”\n\nCaptain Hawthorne was folding up a letter in great haste, and either could not or would not answer fully.\n\n“Yes,” said he, “very true; here we separate, but Kingston and I shall soon be after you; that is, Kingston, if you are ready, I am in half a minute. I know you will not be sorry to be off. I shall be at your service in half a minute.”\n\nMrs Sutherland left them, and Captain Hawthorne, having sealed his letter with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried, agitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone. Clara knew not how to understand it. She had the kindest “Good morning, God bless you!” from Captain Kingston, but from him not a word, nor a look! He had passed out of the room without a look!\n\nShe had only time, however, to move closer to the table where he had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning; the door opened, it was himself. He begged their pardon, but he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room to the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Clara with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs Broughton was aware of his being in it: the work of an instant!\n\nThe revolution which one instant had made in Clara, was almost beyond expression. The letter, with a direction hardly legible, to “Miss A. E.—,” was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily. While supposed to be writing only to Captain Collins, he had been also addressing her! On the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her. Anything was possible, anything might be defied rather than suspense. Mrs Broughton had little arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection she must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied, succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written, her eyes devoured the following words:\n\n“I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago. Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant. You alone have brought me to Bath. For you alone, I think and plan. Have you not seen this? Can you fail to have understood my wishes? I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine. I can hardly write. I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me. You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others. Too good, too excellent creature! You do us justice, indeed. You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men. Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in\n\nF. W.\n\n“I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow your party, as soon as possible. A word, a look, will be enough to decide whether I enter your father’s house this evening or never.”\n\nSuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from. Half an hour’s solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity. Every moment rather brought fresh agitation. It was overpowering happiness. And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation, Simon, Diana, and Evelyn all came in.\n\nThe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more. She began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself. They could then see that she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not stir without her for the world. This was dreadful. Would they only have gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting, and in desperation, she said she would go home.\n\n“By all means, my dear,” cried Mrs Broughton, “go home directly, and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening. I wish Martha was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself. Simon, ring and order a chair. She must not walk.”\n\nBut the chair would never do. Worse than all! To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Hawthorne in the course of her quiet, solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him) could not be borne. The chair was earnestly protested against, and Mrs Broughton, who thought only of one sort of illness, having assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in the case; that Clara had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on finding her better at night.\n\nAnxious to omit no possible precaution, Clara struggled, and said—\n\n“I am afraid, ma’am, that it is not perfectly understood. Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening. I am afraid there had been some mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Kingston and Captain Hawthorne, that we hope to see them both.”\n\n“Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word. Captain Kingston has no thought but of going.”\n\n“Do you think so? But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry. Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again? You will see them both this morning, I dare say. Do promise me.”\n\n“To be sure I will, if you wish it. Simon, if you see Captain Kingston anywhere, remember to give Miss Clara’s message. But indeed, my dear, you need not be uneasy. Captain Kingston holds himself quite engaged, I’ll answer for it; and Captain Hawthorne the same, I dare say.”\n\nClara could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity. It could not be very lasting, however. Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself, it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Kingston. Another momentary vexation occurred. Simon, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her; there was no preventing him. This was almost cruel. But she could not be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith’s, to be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling but gratitude apparent.\n\nThey were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something of familiar sound, gave her two moments’ preparation for the sight of Captain Hawthorne. He joined them; but, as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked. Clara could command herself enough to receive that look, and not repulsively. The cheeks which had been pale now glowed, and the movements which had hesitated were decided. He walked by her side. Presently, struck by a sudden thought, Simon said—\n\n“Captain Hawthorne, which way are you going? Only to Gay Street, or farther up the town?”\n\n“I hardly know,” replied Captain Hawthorne, surprised.\n\n“Are you going as high as Belmont? Are you going near Camden Place? Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place, and give Clara your arm to her father’s door. She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to be at that fellow’s in the Market Place. He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance. By his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one day round Winthrop.”\n\nThere could not be an objection. There could be only the most proper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture. In half a minute Simon was at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceeding together: and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow. There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by so many, many years of division and estrangement. There they returned again into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other’s character, truth, and attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting. And there, as they slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers, flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest. All the little variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and to-day there could scarcely be an end.\n\nShe had not mistaken him. Jealousy of Mr Langley had been the retarding weight, the doubt, the torment. That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned, after a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do, in the last four-and-twenty hours. It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions occasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Kingston; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.\n\nOf what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified. He persisted in having loved none but her. She had never been supplanted. He never even believed himself to see her equal. Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge: that he had been constant unconsciously, nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it to be done. He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been a sufferer from them. Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself. At Lyme, he had received lessons of more than one sort. The passing admiration of Mr Langley had at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Kingston’s had fixed her superiority.\n\nIn his preceding attempts to attach himself to Beatrice Broughton (the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care, for Beatrice; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Beatrice’s could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own. There, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind. There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment, which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.\n\nFrom that period his penance had become severe. He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Beatrice’s accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again, than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.\n\n“I found,” said he, “that I was considered by Kingston an engaged man! That neither Kingston nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment. I was startled and shocked. To a degree, I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same—her own family, nay, perhaps herself—I was no longer at my own disposal. I was hers in honour if she wished it. I had been unguarded. I had not thought seriously on this subject before. I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill effects. I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.”\n\nHe found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Beatrice at all, he must regard himself as bound to her, if her sentiments for him were what the Kingstons supposed. It determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere. He would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore, to his brother’s, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require.\n\n“I was six weeks with Theodore,” said he, “and saw him happy. I could have no other pleasure. I deserved none. He enquired after you very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.”\n\nClara smiled, and let it pass. It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach. It is something for a woman to be assured, in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Clara, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be the result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.\n\nHe had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride, and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from Beatrice by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Collins.\n\n“Here,” said he, “ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do something. But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful. Within the first five minutes I said, ‘I will be at Bath on Wednesday,’ and I was. Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive with some degree of hope? You were single. It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine. I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, ‘Was this for me?’”\n\nTheir first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but the concert still more. That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments. The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him: the moment of Mr Langley’s appearing and tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy.\n\n“To see you,” cried he, “in the midst of those who could not be my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling, and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match! To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you! Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be his! Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared? How could I look on without agony? Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence, the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done—was it not all against me?”\n\n“You should have distinguished,” replied Clara. “You should not have suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different. If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk. When I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here. In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred, and all duty violated.”\n\n“Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,” he replied, “but I could not. I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character. I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed, buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year. I could think of you only as one who had yielded, who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me. I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery. I had no reason to believe her of less authority now. The force of habit was to be added.”\n\n“I should have thought,” said Clara, “that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this.”\n\n“No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give. I left you in this belief; and yet, I was determined to see you again. My spirits rallied with the morning, and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.”\n\nAt last Clara was at home again, and happier than any one in that house could have conceived. All the surprise and suspense, and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last. An interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went to her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment.\n\nThe evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled. It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Clara had never found an evening shorter. Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness, and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for, she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her. Mr Langley was there; she avoided, but she could pity him. The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them. Lady Whitmore and Miss Adelaide—they would soon be innoxious cousins to her. She cared not for Mrs Stone, and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister. With the Musgroves, there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Kingston, the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Violet Hargrove, attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral and Mrs Sutherland, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain Hawthorne, some moments of communications continually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his being there.\n\nIt was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said—\n\n“I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now. To me, she was in the place of a parent. Do not mistake me, however. I am not saying that she did not err in her advice. It was, perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice. But I mean, that I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my conscience. I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman’s portion.”\n\nHe looked at her, looked at Lady Violet Hargrove, and looking again at her, replied, as if in cool deliberation—\n\n“Not yet. But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time. I trust to being in charity with her soon. But I too have been thinking over the past, and a question has suggested itself, whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady? My own self. Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you, would you have answered my letter? Would you, in short, have renewed the engagement then?”\n\n“Would I!” was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.\n\n“Good God!” he cried, “you would! It is not that I did not think of it, or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success; but I was proud, too proud to ask again. I did not understand you. I shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice. This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself. Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared. It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me. I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed. I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards. Like other great men under reverses,” he added, with a smile. “I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune. I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve.”\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\nWho can be in doubt of what followed? When any two young people take it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other’s ultimate comfort. This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Hawthorne and an Clara Langley, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing down every opposition? They might in fact, have borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth. Lord Albert made no objection, and Isabella did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned. Captain Hawthorne, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him, was no longer nobody. He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet, who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.\n\nLord Albert, indeed, though he had no affection for Clara, and no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion, was very far from thinking it a bad match for her. On the contrary, when he saw more of Captain Hawthorne, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name, enabled Lord Albert at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.\n\nThe only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was Lady Violet Hargrove. Clara knew that Lady Violet Hargrove must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Langley, and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with, and do justice to Captain Hawthorne. This however was what Lady Violet Hargrove had now to do. She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each; that because Captain Hawthorne’s manners had not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Langley’s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well-regulated mind. There was nothing less for Lady Violet Hargrove to do, than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes.\n\nThere is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience in others can equal, and Lady Violet Hargrove had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend. But she was a very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging, her first was to see Clara happy. She loved Clara better than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.\n\nOf all the family, Diana was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance. It was creditable to have a sister married, and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion, by keeping Clara with her in the autumn; and as her own sister must be better than her husband’s sisters, it was very agreeable that Captain Hawthorne should be a richer man than either Captain Collins or Edmund Carlton. She had something to suffer, perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Clara restored to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation. Clara had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate, no headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Hawthorne from being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Clara.\n\nIt would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation, for a change is not very probable there. She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Langley withdraw, and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.\n\nThe news of his cousin Clara’s engagement burst on Mr Langley most unexpectedly. It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness, his best hope of keeping Lord Albert single by the watchfulness which a son-in-law’s rights would have given. But, though discomfited and disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment. He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Stone’s quitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established under his protection in London, it was evident how double a game he had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman, at least.\n\nMrs Stone’s affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed, for the young man’s sake, the possibility of scheming longer for Lord Albert. She has abilities, however, as well as affections; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being the wife of Lord Albert, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William.\n\nIt cannot be doubted that Lord Albert and Isabella were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of their deception in her. They had their great cousins, to be sure, to resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of half enjoyment.\n\nClara, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Violet Hargrove’s meaning to love Captain Hawthorne as she ought, had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value. There she felt her own inferiority very keenly. The disproportion in their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment’s regret; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly, nothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity. She had but two friends in the world to add to his list, Lady Violet Hargrove and Mrs Johnson. To those, however, he was very well disposed to attach himself. Lady Violet Hargrove, in spite of all her former transgressions, he could now value from his heart. While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them, he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour, and as for Mrs Johnson, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently.\n\nHer recent good offices by Clara had been enough in themselves, and their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend, secured her two. She was their earliest visitor in their settled life; and Captain Hawthorne, by putting her in the way of recovering her husband’s property in the West Indies, by writing for her, acting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend, fully requited the services which she had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.\n\nMrs Johnson’s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income, with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends to be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity. She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be happy. Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits, as her friend Clara’s was in the warmth of her heart. Clara was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it in Captain Hawthorne’s affection. His profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine. She gloried in being a sailor’s wife, but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance.",

    "context": "y; proof of every thing you were saying. But why be acquainted with us now?”\n\n“I can explain this too,” cried Mrs Johnson, smiling.\n\n“Can you really?”\n\n“Yes. I have shewn you Mr Langley as he was a dozen years ago, and I will shew him as he is now. I cannot produce written proof again, but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he is now wanting, and what he is now doing. He is no hypocrite now. He truly wants to marry you. His present attentions to your family are very sincere: quite from the heart. I will give you my authority: his friend Colonel Norris.”\n\n“Colonel Norris! you are acquainted with him?”\n\n“No. It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; it takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence. The stream is as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away. Mr Langley talks unreservedly to Colonel Norris of his views on you, which said Colonel Norris, I imagine to be, in himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Norris has a very pretty silly wife, to whom he tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her. She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all to her nurse; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me. On Monday evening, my good friend Mrs Bright let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings. When I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed.”\n\n“My dear Mrs Johnson, your authority is deficient. This will not do. Mr Langley’s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father. That was all prior to my coming to Bath. I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived.”\n\n“I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but—”\n\n“Indeed, Mrs Johnson, we must not expect to get real information in such a line. Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can hardly have much truth left.”\n\n“Only give me a hearing. You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm. Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement. He had seen you indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without knowing it to be you. So says my historian, at least. Is this true? Did he see you last summer or autumn, ‘somewhere down in the west,’ to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?”\n\n“He certainly did. So far it is very true. At Lyme. I happened to be at Lyme.”\n\n“Well,” continued Mrs Johnson, triumphantly, “grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted. He saw you then at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Clara Langley, and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there. But there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain. If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable, stop me. My account states, that your sister’s friend, the lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Langley and Lord Albert as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea, among Lord Albert’s acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Eleanor Langley, and as general a surprise that Miss Langley should be apparently, blind to the danger.”\n\nHere Mrs Johnson paused a moment; but Clara had not a word to say, and she continued—\n\n“This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family, long before you returned to it; and Colonel Norris had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Langley gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Langley came to Bath for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas, Colonel Norris made him acquainted with the appearance of things, and the reports beginning to prevail. Now you are to understand, that time had worked a very material change in Mr Langley’s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy. Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man. Having long had as much money as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to. I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling. He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William. You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady if he found it material. This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Norris was to assist in every way that he could. He was to be introduced, and Mrs Norris was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced. Mr Langley came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added another motive), to watch Lord Albert and Mrs Stone. He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject. You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.”\n\n“Yes,” said Clara, “you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known, or could imagine. There is always something offensive in the details of cunning. The manœuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me. I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Langley, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied. I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared. I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not.”\n\n“Lessening, I understand,” replied Mrs Johnson. “He thinks Mrs Stone afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence. But since he must be absent some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence. Mrs Norris has an amusing idea, as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Langley marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Stone. A scheme, worthy of Mrs Norris’s understanding, by all accounts; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it. ‘Why, to be sure, ma’am,’ said she, ‘it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.’ And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a very strenuous opposer of Lord Albert’s making a second match. She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Eleanor Langley, through Mrs Norris’s recommendation?”\n\n“I am very glad to know all this,” said Clara, after a little thoughtfulness. “It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do. My line of conduct will be more direct. Mr Langley is evidently a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness.”\n\nBut Mr Langley was not done with. Mrs Johnson had been carried away from her first direction, and Clara had forgotten, in the interest of her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied against him; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints, and she listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Johnson, proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her; very deficient both in justice and compassion.\n\nShe learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Langley’s marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr Langley had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune. Mrs Johnson did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender of throwing any on her husband; but Clara could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance. From his wife’s account of him she could discern Mr Johnson to have been a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him, led by him, and probably despised by him. Mr Langley, raised by his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself, (for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man), and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend’s probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined.\n\nThe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it. They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr Langley’s had better not be tried; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known. With a confidence in Mr Langley’s regard, more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Johnson had appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Langley would not act, and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her, in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to without corresponding indignation.\n\nClara was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to urgent applications from Mrs Johnson, which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her. It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Clara felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime could have been worse. She had a great deal to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence. Clara could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend’s usual state of mind.\n\nThere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation. She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and this property, though not large, would be enough to make her comparatively rich. But there was nobody to stir in it. Mr Langley would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself, equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money. She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel, and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law. This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means. To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances, that a little trouble in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims, was hard to bear.\n\nIt was on this point that she had hoped to engage Clara’s good offices with Mr Langley. She had previously, in the anticipation of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature, since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Clara’s feelings, as far as the observances due to Mr Langley’s character would allow, when Clara’s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way.\n\nAfter listening to this full description of Mr Langley, Clara could not but express some surprise at Mrs Johnson’s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation. “She had seemed to recommend and praise him!”\n\n“My dear,” was Mrs Johnson’s reply, “there was nothing else to be done. I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if he had been your husband. My heart bled for you, as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless. He was very unkind to his first wife. They were wretched together. But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her. I was willing to hope that you must fare better.”\n\nClara could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed. It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Violet Hargrove! And under such a supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had disclosed all, too late?\n\nIt was very desirable that Lady Violet Hargrove should be no longer deceived; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference, which carried them through the greater part of the morning, was, that Clara had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Johnson, in which his conduct was involved.\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\nClara went home to think over all that she had heard. In one point, her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Langley. There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him. He stood as opposed to Captain Hawthorne, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness; and the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief he might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed. Pity for him was all over. But this was the only point of relief. In every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward, she saw more to distrust and to apprehend. She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Violet Hargrove would be feeling; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister, and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how to avert any one of them. She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him. She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Johnson, but here was a reward indeed springing from it! Mrs Johnson had been able to tell her what no one else could have done. Could the knowledge have been extended through her family? But this was a vain idea. She must talk to Lady Violet Hargrove, tell her, consult with her, and having done her best, wait the event with as much composure as possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Violet Hargrove; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.\n\nShe found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended, escaped seeing Mr Langley; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself, and felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.\n\n“I had not the smallest intention of asking him,” said Isabella, with affected carelessness, “but he gave so many hints; so Mrs Stone says, at least.”\n\n“Indeed, I do say it. I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation. Poor man! I was really in pain for him; for your hard-hearted sister, Miss Clara, seems bent on cruelty.”\n\n“Oh!” cried Isabella, “I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman’s hints. However, when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and Lord Albert together. They appear to so much advantage in company with each other. Each behaving so pleasantly. Mr Langley looking up with so much respect.”\n\n“Quite delightful!” cried Mrs Stone, not daring, however, to turn her eyes towards Clara. “Exactly like father and son! Dear Miss Langley, may I not say father and son?”\n\n“Oh! I lay no embargo on any body’s words. If you will have such ideas! But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men.”\n\n“My dear Miss Langley!” exclaimed Mrs Stone, lifting her hands and eyes, and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.\n\n“Well, my dear Hazel, you need not be so alarmed about him. I did invite him, you know. I sent him away with smiles. When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.”\n\nClara admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object. It was impossible but that Mrs Stone must hate the sight of Mr Langley; and yet she could assume a most obliging, placid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Lord Albert as she would have done otherwise.\n\nTo Clara herself it was most distressing to see Mr Langley enter the room; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her. She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere, but now she saw insincerity in everything. His attentive deference to her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Johnson, she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness, or the sound of his artificial good sentiments.\n\nShe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side. It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, as quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along. She was accordingly more guarded, and more cool, than she had been the night before.\n\nHe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken: he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin’s vanity; he found, at least, that it was not to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims of the others. He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest, bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable.\n\nShe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part of two days. He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain. It was bad enough that a Mrs Stone should be always before her; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort. It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Isabella; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them! Mrs Stone’s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Clara would have compounded for the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Langley’s subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.\n\nOn Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Violet Hargrove, and accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Stone was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion. She saw Mrs Stone fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street.\n\n“Very well,” said Isabella, “I have nothing to send but my love. Oh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me, and pretend I have read it through. I really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out. Lady Violet Hargrove quite bores one with her new publications. You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night. I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her at the concert. Something so formal and arrangé in her air! and she sits so upright! My best love, of course.”\n\n“And mine,” added Lord Albert. “Kindest regards. And you may say, that I mean to call upon her soon. Make a civil message; but I shall only leave my card. Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little. If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately.”\n\nWhile her father spoke, there was a knock at the door. Who could it be? Clara, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Langley, would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off. After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard, and “Mr and Mrs Simon Broughton” were ushered into the room.\n\nSurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance; but Clara was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that house, Lord Albert and Isabella were able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well. They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Broughton, and were at the White Hart. So much was pretty soon understood; but till Lord Albert and Isabella were walking Diana into the other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration, Clara could not draw upon Simon’s brain for a regular history of their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Diana, as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of.\n\nShe then found that it consisted of Mrs Broughton, Evelyn, and Captain Kingston, beside their two selves. He gave her a very plain, intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding. The scheme had received its first impulse by Captain Kingston’s wanting to come to Bath on business. He had begun to talk of it a week ago; and by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Simon had proposed coming with him, and Mrs Kingston had seemed to like the idea of it very much, as an advantage to her husband; but Diana could not bear to be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end. But then, it had been taken up by his father and mother. His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought a good opportunity for Evelyn to come and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being his mother’s party, that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Kingston; and he and Diana were included in it by way of general convenience. They had arrived late the night before. Mrs Kingston, her children, and Captain Collins, remained with Mr Broughton and Beatrice at Uppercross.\n\nClara’s only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Evelyn’s wedding-clothes to be talked of. She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Simon that, very recently, (since Diana’s last letter to herself), Edmund Carlton had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question, the two families had consented to the young people’s wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months, quite as soon as Beatrice’s. “And a very good living it was,” Simon added: “only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and in a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire. In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two of the three at least, Edmund Carlton might get a special recommendation. Not that he will value it as he ought,” he observed, “Simon is too cool about sporting. That’s the worst of him.”\n\n“I am extremely glad, indeed,” cried Clara, “particularly glad that this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well, and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other—that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort. I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.”\n\n“Oh! yes. My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer, but he has no other fault to find. Money, you know, coming down with money—two daughters at once—it cannot be a very agreeable operation, and it streightens him as to many things. However, I do not mean to say they have not a right to it. It is very fit they should have daughters’ shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind, liberal father to me. Diana does not above half like Evelyn’s match. She never did, you know. But she does not do him justice, nor think enough about Winthrop. I cannot make her attend to the value of the property. It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked Edmund Carlton all my life, and I shall not leave off now.”\n\n“Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Broughton,” exclaimed Clara, “should be happy in their children’s marriages. They do everything to confer happiness, I am sure. What a blessing to young people to be in such hands! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery, both in young and old. I hope you think Beatrice perfectly recovered now?”\n\nHe answered rather hesitatingly, “Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered; but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing or dancing; it is quite different. If one happens only to shut the door a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water; and Collins sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her, all day long.”\n\nClara could not help laughing. “That cannot be much to your taste, I know,” said she; “but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.”\n\n“To be sure he is. Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself. I have a great value for Collins; and when one can but get him to talk, he has plenty to say. His reading has done him no harm, for he has fought as well as read. He is a brave fellow. I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before. We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father’s great barns; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since.”\n\nHere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Simon’s following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Clara had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced, her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it. She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want to lessen theirs.\n\nThe visit passed off altogether in high good humour. Diana was in excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law’s carriage with four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place, that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought, and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as they were detailed to her. She had no demands on her father or sister, and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing-rooms.\n\nIsabella was, for a short time, suffering a good deal. She felt that Mrs Broughton and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style, the reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch. It was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then Isabella was happy again. These were her internal persuasions: “Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Beatrice never does; did not even ask her own sister’s family, though they were here a month: and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Broughton; put her quite out of her way. I am sure she would rather not come; she cannot feel easy with us. I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat. They have not seen two such drawing rooms before. They will be delighted to come to-morrow evening. It shall be a regular party, small, but most elegant.” And this satisfied Isabella: and when the invitation was given to the two present, and promised for the absent, Diana was as completely satisfied. She was particularly asked to meet Mr Langley, and be introduced to Lady Whitmore and Miss Adelaide, who were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention. Miss Langley was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Broughton in the course of the morning; and Clara walked off with Simon and Diana, to go and see her and Evelyn directly.\n\nHer plan of sitting with Lady Violet Hargrove must give way for the present. They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes; but Clara convinced herself that a day’s delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart, to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn, with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.\n\nThey found Mrs Broughton and her daughter within, and by themselves, and Clara had the kindest welcome from each. Evelyn was exactly in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all; and Mrs Broughton’s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress. It was a heartiness, and a warmth, and a sincerity which Clara delighted in the more, from the sad want of such blessings at home. She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on Simon’s leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Broughton’s history of Beatrice, and to Evelyn’s of herself, giving opinions on business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help which Diana required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts; from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Diana, well amused as she generally was, in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her moments of imagining.\n\nA morning of thorough confusion was to be expected. A large party in an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene. One five minutes brought a note, the next a parcel; and Clara had not been there half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half filled: a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Broughton, and Simon came back with Captains Kingston and Wentworth. The appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment. It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again. Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings; she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had hastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed. He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.\n\nShe tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:—“Surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understand each other ere long. We are not boy and girl, to be captiously irritable, misled by every moment’s inadvertence, and wantonly playing with our own happiness.” And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company with each other, under their present circumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind.\n\n“Clara,” cried Diana, still at her window, “there is Mrs Stone, I am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her. I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now. They seemed deep in talk. Who is it? Come, and tell me. Good heavens! I recollect. It is Mr Langley himself.”\n\n“No,” cried Clara, quickly, “it cannot be Mr Langley, I assure you. He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till to-morrow.”\n\nAs she spoke, she felt that Captain Hawthorne was looking at her, the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret that she had said so much, simple as it was.\n\nDiana, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin, began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Langley, calling again upon Clara to come and look for herself, but Clara did not mean to stir, and tried to be cool and unconcerned. Her distress returned, however, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves quite in the secret. It was evident that the report concerning her had spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther.\n\n“Do come, Clara,” cried Diana, “come and look yourself. You will be too late if you do not make haste. They are parting; they are shaking hands. He is turning away. Not know Mr Langley, indeed! You seem to have forgot all about Lyme.”\n\nTo pacify Diana, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment, Clara did move quietly to the window. She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr Langley, which she had never believed, before he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Stone walked quickly off on the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest, she calmly said, “Yes, it is Mr Langley, certainly. He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may be mistaken, I might not attend;” and walked back to her chair, recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well.\n\nThe visitors took their leave; and Simon, having civilly seen them off, and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with—\n\n“Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like. I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night. A’n’t I a good boy? I know you love a play; and there is room for us all. It holds nine. I have engaged Captain Hawthorne. Clara will not be sorry to join us, I am sure. We all like a play. Have not I done well, mother?”\n\nMrs Broughton was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play, if Evelyn and all the others liked it, when Diana eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming—\n\n“Good heavens, Simon! how can you think of such a thing? Take a box for to-morrow night! Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Whitmore and her daughter, and Mr Langley, and all the principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them? How can you be so forgetful?”\n\n“Phoo! phoo!” replied Simon, “what’s an evening party? Never worth remembering. Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if he had wanted to see us. You may do as you like, but I shall go to the play.”\n\n“Oh! Simon, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you promised to go.”\n\n“No, I did not promise. I only smirked and bowed, and said the word ‘happy.’ There was no promise.”\n\n“But you must go, Simon. It would be unpardonable to fail. We were asked on purpose to be introduced. There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves. Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately. We are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Langley too, whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with! Every attention is due to Mr Langley. Consider, my father’s heir: the future representative of the family.”\n\n“Don’t talk to me about heirs and representatives,” cried Simon. “I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun. If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir. What is Mr Langley to me?” The careless expression was life to Clara, who saw that Captain Hawthorne was all attention, looking and listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Simon to herself.\n\nSimon and Diana still talked on in the same style; he, half serious and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she, invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself, she should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play without her. Mrs Broughton interposed.\n\n“We had better put it off. Simon, you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday. It would be a pity to be divided, and we should be losing Miss Clara, too, if there is a party at her father’s; and I am sure neither Evelyn nor I should care at all for the play, if Miss Clara could not be with us.”\n\nClara felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying—\n\n“If it depended only on my inclination, ma’am, the party at home (excepting on Diana’s account) would not be the smallest impediment. I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to change it for a play, and with you. But, it had better not be attempted, perhaps.” She had spoken it; but she trembled when it was done, conscious that her words were listened to, and daring not even to try to observe their effect.\n\nIt was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; Simon only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife, by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.\n\nCaptain Hawthorne left his seat, and walked to the fire-place; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards, and taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Clara.\n\n“You have not been long enough in Bath,” said he, “to enjoy the evening parties of the place.”\n\n“Oh! no. The usual character of them has nothing for me. I am no card-player.”\n\n“You were not formerly, I know. You did not use to like cards; but time makes many changes.”\n\n“I am not yet so much changed,” cried Clara, and stopped, fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction. After waiting a few moments he said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling, “It is a period, indeed! Eight years and a half is a period.”\n\nWhether he would have proceeded farther was left to Clara’s imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Evelyn, eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out, and calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else should come in.\n\nThey were obliged to move. Clara talked of being perfectly ready, and tried to look it; but she felt that could Evelyn have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair, in preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own sensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection, wherewith to pity her.\n\nTheir preparations, however, were stopped short. Alarming sounds were heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for Lord Albert and Miss Langley, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill. Clara felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same. The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister. How mortifying to feel that it was so!\n\nHer jealous eye was satisfied in one particular. Captain Hawthorne was acknowledged again by each, by Isabella more graciously than before. She even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once. Isabella was, in fact, revolving a great measure. The sequel explained it. After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves. “To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends: no formal party.” It was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had provided herself, the “Miss Langley at home,” were laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Hawthorne. The truth was, that Isabella had been long enough in Bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his. The past was nothing. The present was that Captain Hawthorne would move about well in her drawing-room. The card was pointedly given, and Lord Albert and Isabella arose and disappeared.\n\nThe interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out, but not to Clara. She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which it had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather than gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance. She knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement for all the insolence of the past. Her spirits sank. He held the card in his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.\n\n“Only think of Isabella’s including everybody!” whispered Diana very audibly. “I do not wonder Captain Hawthorne is delighted! You see he cannot put the card out of his hand.”\n\nClara caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.\n\nThe party separated. The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Clara belonged to them. She was earnestly begged to return and dine, and give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more, and fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose.\n\nPromising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore, she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Isabella and Mrs Stone for the morrow’s party, the frequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending question, of whether Captain Hawthorne would come or not? They were reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together. She generally thought he would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.\n\nShe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation, to let Mrs Stone know that she had been seen with Mr Langley three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath, for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Stone’s face as she listened. It was transient: cleared away in an instant; but Clara could imag",

Perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company. Then, also, she was more civil than she had been. He did not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by them to do things.\n\n\"Tha'rt like th' robin,\" he said to her one morning when he lifted his head and saw her standing by him. \"I never knows when I shall see thee or which side tha'll come from.\"\n\n\"He's friends with me now,\" said Clara.\n\n\"That's like him,\" snapped Gus Greenfield. \"Makin' up to th' women folk just for vanity an' flightiness. There's nothin' he wouldn't do for th' sake o' showin' off an' flirtin' his tail-feathers. He's as full o' pride as an egg's full o' meat.\"\n\nHe very seldom talked much and sometimes [Pg 114]did not even answer Clara's questions except by a grunt, but this morning he said more than usual. He stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while he looked her over.\n\n\"How long has tha' been here?\" he jerked out.\n\n\"I think it's about a month,\" she answered.\n\n\"Tha's beginnin' to do Misselthwaite credit,\" he said. \"Tha's a bit fatter than tha' was an' tha's not quite so yeller. Tha' looked like a young plucked crow when tha' first came into this garden. Thinks I to myself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young 'un.\"\n\nClara was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she was not greatly disturbed.\n\n\"I know I'm fatter,\" she said. \"My stockings are getting tighter. They used to make wrinkles. There's the robin, Gus Greenfield.\"\n\nThere, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than ever. His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces. He seemed determined to make Gus Greenfield admire him. But Ben was sarcastic.\n\n\"Aye, there tha' art!\" he said. \"Tha' can [Pg 115]put up with me for a bit sometimes when tha's got no one better. Tha's been reddinin' up thy waistcoat an' polishin' thy feathers this two weeks. I know what tha's up to. Tha's courtin' some bold young madam somewhere, tellin' thy lies to her about bein' th' finest cock robin on Missel Moor an' ready to fight all th' rest of 'em.\"\n\n\"Oh! look at him!\" exclaimed Clara.\n\nThe robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood. He hopped closer and closer and looked at Gus Greenfield more and more engagingly. He flew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a little song right at him.\n\n\"Tha' thinks tha'll get over me by doin' that,\" said Ben, wrinkling his face up in such a way that Clara felt sure he was trying not to look pleased. \"Tha' thinks no one can stand out against thee—that's what tha' thinks.\"\n\nThe robin spread his wings—Clara could scarcely believe her eyes. He flew right up to the handle of Gus Greenfield's spade and alighted on the top of it. Then the old man's face wrinkled itself slowly into a new expression. He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe—as if he would not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away. He spoke quite in a whisper.\n\n\"Well, I'm danged!\" he said as softly as if [Pg 116]he were saying something quite different. \"Tha' does know how to get at a chap—tha' does! Tha's fair unearthly, tha's so knowin'.\"\n\nAnd he stood without stirring—almost without drawing his breath—until the robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away. Then he stood looking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it, and then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.\n\nBut because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Clara was not afraid to talk to him.\n\n\"Have you a garden of your own?\" she asked.\n\n\"No. I'm bachelder an' lodge with Martin at th' gate.\"\n\n\"If you had one,\" said Clara, \"what would you plant?\"\n\n\"Cabbages an' 'taters an' onions.\"\n\n\"But if you wanted to make a flower garden,\" persisted Clara, \"what would you plant?\"\n\n\"Bulbs an' sweet-smellin' things—but mostly roses.\"\n\nClara's face lighted up.\n\n\"Do you like roses?\" she said.\n\nGus Greenfield rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered.\n\n\"Well, yes, I do. I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to. She had a lot in a place she was fond of, an' she loved 'em like they [Pg 117]was children—or robins. I've seen her bend over an' kiss 'em.\" He dragged out another weed and scowled at it. \"That were as much as ten year' ago.\"\n\n\"Where is she now?\" asked Clara, much interested.\n\n\"Heaven,\" he answered, and drove his spade deep into the soil, \"'cording to what parson says.\"\n\n\"What happened to the roses?\" Clara asked again, more interested than ever.\n\n\"They was left to themselves.\"\n\nClara was becoming quite excited.\n\n\"Did they quite die? Do roses quite die when they are left to themselves?\" she ventured.\n\n\"Well, I'd got to like 'em—an' I liked her—an' she liked 'em,\" Gus Greenfield admitted reluctantly. \"Once or twice a year I'd go an' work at 'em a bit—prune 'em an' dig about th' roots. They run wild, but they was in rich soil, so some of 'em lived.\"\n\n\"When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you tell whether they are dead or alive?\" inquired Clara.\n\n\"Wait till th' spring gets at 'em—wait till th' sun shines on th' rain an' th' rain falls on th' sunshine an' then tha'll find out.\"\n\n\"How—how?\" cried Clara, forgetting to be careful.[Pg 118]\n\n\"Look along th' twigs an' branches an' if tha' sees a bit of a brown lump swelling here an' there, watch it after th' warm rain an' see what happens.\" He stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face. \"Why does tha' care so much about roses an' such, all of a sudden?\" he demanded.\n\nMistress Clara felt her face grow red. She was almost afraid to answer.\n\n\"I—I want to play that—that I have a garden of my own,\" she stammered. \"I—there is nothing for me to do. I have nothing—and no one.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Gus Greenfield slowly, as he watched her, \"that's true. Tha' hasn't.\"\n\nHe said it in such an odd way that Clara wondered if he was actually a little sorry for her. She had never felt sorry for herself; she had only felt tired and cross, because she disliked people and things so much. But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer. If no one found out about the secret garden, she should enjoy herself always.\n\nShe stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as many questions as she dared. He answered every one of them in his queer grunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his spade and leave her.[Pg 119] He said something about roses just as she was going away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond of.\n\n\"Do you go and see those other roses now?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not been this year. My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th' joints.\"\n\nHe said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he seemed to get angry with her, though she did not see why he should.\n\n\"Now look here!\" he said sharply. \"Don't tha' ask so many questions. Tha'rt th' worst wench for askin' questions I've ever come across. Get thee gone an' play thee. I've done talkin' for to-day.\"\n\nAnd he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in staying another minute. She went skipping slowly down the outside walk, thinking him over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was another person whom she liked in spite of his crossness. She liked old Gus Greenfield. Yes, she did like him. She always wanted to try to make him talk to her. Also she began to believe that he knew everything in the world about flowers.\n\nThere was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought [Pg 120]she would skip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when she reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she heard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was.\n\nIt was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she stopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back against it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy about twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Clara seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy's face. And on the trunk of the tree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses—and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little call his pipe seemed to make.\n\nWhen he saw Clara he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost as low as and rather like his piping.\n\n\"Don't tha' move,\" he said. \"It'd flight 'em.\"[Pg 121]\n\nClara remained motionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the ground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away, though not at all as if they were frightened.\n\n\"I'm Ewan,\" the boy said. \"I know tha'rt Miss Clara.\"\n\nThen Clara realized that somehow she had known at first that he was Ewan. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the natives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and his smile spread all over his face.\n\n\"I got up slow,\" he explained, \"because if tha' makes a quick move it startles 'em. A body 'as to move gentle an' speak low when wild things is about.\"\n\nHe did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but as if he knew her quite well. Clara knew nothing about boys and she spoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy.\n\n\"Did you get Libby's letter?\" she asked.\n\nHe nodded his curly, rust-colored head.[Pg 122]\n\n\"That's why I come.\"\n\nHe stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground beside him when he piped.\n\n\"I've got th' garden tools. There's a little spade an' rake an' a fork an' hoe. Eh! they are good 'uns. There's a trowel, too. An' th' woman in th' shop threw in a packet o' white poppy an' one o' blue larkspur when I bought th' other seeds.\"\n\n\"Will you show the seeds to me?\" Clara said.\n\nShe wished she could talk as he did. His speech was so quick and easy. It sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would not like him, though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes and with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head. As she came closer to him she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him, almost as if he were made of them. She liked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy.\n\n\"Let us sit down on this log and look at them,\" she said.\n\nThey sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of his coat pocket. He untied the string and inside there were ever so many [Pg 123]neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one.\n\n\"There's a lot o' mignonette an' poppies,\" he said. \"Mignonette's th' sweetest smellin' thing as grows, an' it'll grow wherever you cast it, same as poppies will. Them as'll come up an' bloom if you just whistle to 'em, them's th' nicest of all.\"\n\nHe stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lighting up.\n\n\"Where's that robin as is callin' us?\" he said.\n\nThe chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries, and Clara thought she knew whose it was.\n\n\"Is it really calling us?\" she asked.\n\n\"Aye,\" said Ewan, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, \"he's callin' some one he's friends with. That's same as sayin' 'Here I am. Look at me. I wants a bit of a chat.' There he is in the bush. Whose is he?\"\n\n\"He's Gus Greenfield's, but I think he knows me a little,\" answered Clara.\n\n\"Aye, he knows thee,\" said Ewan in his low voice again. \"An' he likes thee. He's took thee on. He'll tell me all about thee in a minute.\"\n\nHe moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Clara had noticed before, and then he made a sound almost like the robin's own twitter. The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and [Pg 124]then answered quite as if he were replying to a question.\n\n\"Aye, he's a friend o' yours,\" chuckled Ewan.\n\n\"Do you think he is?\" cried Clara eagerly. She did so want to know. \"Do you think he really likes me?\"\n\n\"He wouldn't come near thee if he didn't,\" answered Ewan. \"Birds is rare choosers an' a robin can flout a body worse than a man. See, he's making up to thee now. 'Cannot tha' see a chap?' he's sayin'.\"\n\nAnd it really seemed as if it must be true. He so sidled and twittered and tilted as he hopped on his bush.\n\n\"Do you understand everything birds say?\" said Clara.\n\nEwan's grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, and he rubbed his rough head.\n\n\"I think I do, and they think I do,\" he said. \"I've lived on th' moor with 'em so long. I've watched 'em break shell an' come out an' fledge an' learn to fly an' begin to sing, till I think I'm one of 'em. Sometimes I think p'raps I'm a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or a squirrel, or even a beetle, an' I don't know it.\"\n\nHe laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower seeds again. He told her what they looked like when they were flowers; [Pg 125]he told her how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them.\n\n\"See here,\" he said suddenly, turning round to look at her. \"I'll plant them for thee myself. Where is tha' garden?\"\n\nClara's thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap. She did not know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing. She had never thought of this. She felt miserable. And she felt as if she went red and then pale.\n\n\"Tha's got a bit o' garden, hasn't tha'?\" Ewan said.\n\nIt was true that she had turned red and then pale. Ewan saw her do it, and as she still said nothing, he began to be puzzled.\n\n\"Wouldn't they give thee a bit?\" he asked. \"Hasn't tha' got any yet?\"\n\nShe held her hands even tighter and turned her eyes toward him.\n\n\"I don't know anything about boys,\" she said slowly. \"Could you keep a secret, if I told you one? It's a great secret. I don't know what I should do if any one found it out. I believe I should die!\" She said the last sentence quite fiercely.\n\nEwan looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his rough head again, but he answered quite good-humoredly.[Pg 126]\n\n\"I'm keepin' secrets all th' time,\" he said. \"If I couldn't keep secrets from th' other lads, secrets about foxes' cubs, an' birds' nests, an' wild things' holes, there'd be naught safe on th' moor. Aye, I can keep secrets.\"\n\nMistress Clara did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve but she did it.\n\n\"I've stolen a garden,\" she said very fast. \"It isn't mine. It isn't anybody's. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes into it. Perhaps everything is dead in it already; I don't know.\"\n\nShe began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life.\n\n\"I don't care, I don't care! Nobody has any right to take it from me when I care about it and they don't. They're letting it die, all shut in by itself,\" she ended passionately, and she threw her arms over her face and burst out crying—poor little Mistress Clara.\n\nEwan's curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.\n\n\"Eh-h-h!\" he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the way he did it meant both wonder and sympathy.\n\n\"I've nothing to do,\" said Clara. \"Nothing belongs to me. I found it myself and I got into it myself. I was only just like the robin, and they wouldn't take it from the robin.\"[Pg 127]\n\n\"Where is it?\" asked Ewan in a dropped voice.\n\nMistress Clara got up from the log at once. She knew she felt contrary again, and obstinate, and she did not care at all. She was imperious and Indian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful.\n\n\"Come with me and I'll show you,\" she said.\n\nShe led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so thickly. Ewan followed her with a queer, almost pitying, look on his face. He felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird's nest and must move softly. When she stepped to the wall and lifted the hanging ivy he started. There was a door and Clara pushed it slowly open and they passed in together, and then Clara stood and waved her hand round defiantly.\n\n\"It's this,\" she said. \"It's a secret garden, and I'm the only one in the world who wants it to be alive.\"\n\nEwan looked round and round about it, and round and round again.\n\n\"Eh!\" he almost whispered, \"it is a queer, pretty place! It's like as if a body was in a dream.\"[Pg 128]\n\nCHAPTER XI\nTHE NEST OF THE MISSEL THRUSH\nFor two or three minutes he stood looking round him, while Clara watched him, and then he began to walk about softly, even more lightly than Clara had walked the first time she had found herself inside the four walls. His eyes seemed to be taking in everything—the gray trees with the gray creepers climbing over them and hanging from their branches, the tangle on the walls and among the grass, the evergreen alcoves with the stone seats and tall flower urns standing in them.\n\n\"I never thought I'd see this place,\" he said at last, in a whisper.\n\n\"Did you know about it?\" asked Clara.\n\nShe had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her.\n\n\"We must talk low,\" he said, \"or some one'll hear us an' wonder what's to do in here.\"\n\n\"Oh! I forgot!\" said Clara, feeling frightened and putting her hand quickly against her mouth. \"Did you know about the garden?\" she asked again when she had recovered herself.[Pg 129]\n\nEwan nodded.\n\n\"Libby told me there was one as no one ever went inside,\" he answered. \"Us used to wonder what it was like.\"\n\nHe stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him, and his round eyes looked queerly happy.\n\n\"Eh! the nests as'll be here come springtime,\" he said. \"It'd be th' safest nestin' place in England. No one never comin' near an' tangles o' trees an' roses to build in. I wonder all th' birds on th' moor don't build here.\"\n\nMistress Clara put her hand on his arm again without knowing it.\n\n\"Will there be roses?\" she whispered. \"Can you tell? I thought perhaps they were all dead.\"\n\n\"Eh! No! Not them—not all of 'em!\" he answered. \"Look here!\"\n\nHe stepped over to the nearest tree—an old, old one with gray lichen all over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and branches. He took a thick knife out of his pocket and opened one of its blades.\n\n\"There's lots o' dead wood as ought to be cut out,\" he said. \"An' there's a lot o' old wood, but it made some new last year. This here's a new bit,\" and he touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead of hard, dry gray.[Pg 130]\n\nClara touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.\n\n\"That one?\" she said. \"Is that one quite alive—quite?\"\n\nEwan curved his wide smiling mouth.\n\n\"It's as wick as you or me,\" he said; and Clara remembered that Libby had told her that \"wick\" meant \"alive\" or \"lively.\"\n\n\"I'm glad it's wick!\" she cried out in her whisper. \"I want them all to be wick. Let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones there are.\"\n\nShe quite panted with eagerness, and Ewan was as eager as she was. They went from tree to tree and from bush to bush. Ewan carried his knife in his hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful.\n\n\"They've run wild,\" he said, \"but th' strongest ones has fair thrived on it. The delicatest ones has died out, but th' others has growed an' growed, an' spread an' spread, till they's a wonder. See here!\" and he pulled down a thick gray, dry-looking branch. \"A body might think this was dead wood, but I don't believe it is—down to th' root. I'll cut it low down an' see.\"\n\nHe knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through, not far above the earth.\n\n\"There!\" he said exultantly. \"I told thee [Pg 131]so. There's green in that wood yet. Look at it.\"\n\nClara was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might.\n\n\"When it looks a bit greenish an' juicy like that, it's wick,\" he explained. \"When th' inside is dry an' breaks easy, like this here piece I've cut off, it's done for. There's a big root here as all this live wood sprung out of, an' if th' old wood's cut off an' it's dug round, an' took care of there'll be—\" he stopped and lifted his face to look up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him—\"there'll be a fountain o' roses here this summer.\"\n\nThey went from bush to bush and from tree to tree. He was very strong and clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood away, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green life in it. In the course of half an hour Clara thought she could tell too, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry out joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade of moist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. He showed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade and stirred the earth and let the air in.\n\nThey were working industriously round one [Pg 132]of the biggest standard roses when he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation of surprise.\n\n\"Why!\" he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. \"Who did that there?\"\n\nIt was one of Clara's own little clearings round the pale green points.\n\n\"I did it,\" said Clara.\n\n\"Why, I thought tha' didn't know nothin' about gardenin',\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"I don't,\" she answered, \"but they were so little, and the grass was so thick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe. So I made a place for them. I don't even know what they are.\"\n\nEwan went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile.\n\n\"Tha' was right,\" he said. \"A gardener couldn't have told thee better. They'll grow now like Jack's bean-stalk. They're crocuses an' snowdrops, an' these here is narcissuses,\" turning to another patch, \"an' here's daffydowndillys. Eh! they will be a sight.\"\n\nHe ran from one clearing to another.\n\n\"Tha' has done a lot o' work for such a little wench,\" he said, looking her over.\n\n\"I'm growing fatter,\" said Clara, \"and I'm growing stronger. I used always to be tired.[Pg 133] When I dig I'm not tired at all. I like to smell the earth when it's turned up.\"\n\n\"It's rare good for thee,\" he said, nodding his head wisely. \"There's naught as nice as th' smell o' good clean earth, except th' smell o' fresh growin' things when th' rain falls on 'em. I get out on th' moor many a day when it's rainin' an' I lie under a bush an' listen to th' soft swish o' drops on th' heather an' I just sniff an' sniff. My nose end fair quivers like a rabbit's, mother says.\"\n\n\"Do you never catch cold?\" inquired Clara, gazing at him wonderingly. She had never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one.\n\n\"Not me,\" he said, grinning. \"I never ketched cold since I was born. I wasn't brought up nesh enough. I've chased about th' moor in all weathers same as th' rabbits does. Mother says I've sniffed up too much fresh air for twelve year' to ever get to sniffin' with cold. I'm as tough as a white-thorn knobstick.\"\n\nHe was working all the time he was talking and Clara was following him and helping him with her fork or the trowel.\n\n\"There's a lot of work to do here!\" he said once, looking about quite exultantly.\n\n\"Will you come again and help me to do it?\" Clara begged. \"I'm sure I can help, too. I can [Pg 134]dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell me. Oh! do come, Ewan!\"\n\n\"I'll come every day if tha' wants me, rain or shine,\" he answered stoutly. \"It's th' best fun I ever had in my life—shut in here an' wakenin' up a garden.\"\n\n\"If you will come,\" said Clara, \"if you will help me to make it alive I'll—I don't know what I'll do,\" she ended helplessly. What could you do for a boy like that?\n\n\"I'll tell thee what tha'll do,\" said Ewan, with his happy grin. \"Tha'll get fat an' tha'll get as hungry as a young fox an' tha'll learn how to talk to th' robin same as I do. Eh! we'll have a lot o' fun.\"\n\nHe began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls and bushes with a thoughtful expression.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to make it look like a gardener's garden, all clipped an' spick an' span, would you?\" he said. \"It's nicer like this with things runnin' wild, an' swingin' an' catchin' hold of each other.\"\n\n\"Don't let us make it tidy,\" said Clara anxiously. \"It wouldn't seem like a secret garden if it was tidy.\"\n\nEwan stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.[Pg 135]\n\n\"It's a secret garden sure enough,\" he said, \"but seems like some one besides th' robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year' ago.\"\n\n\"But the door was locked and the key was buried,\" said Clara. \"No one could get in.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" he answered. \"It's a queer place. Seems to me as if there'd been a bit o' prunin' done here an' there, later than ten year' ago.\"\n\n\"But how could it have been done?\" said Clara.\n\nHe was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head.\n\n\"Aye! how could it!\" he murmured. \"With th' door locked an' th' key buried.\"\n\nMistress Clara always felt that however many years she lived she should never forget that first morning when her garden began to grow. Of course, it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning. When Ewan began to clear places to plant seeds, she remembered what Jasper had sung at her when he wanted to tease her.\n\n\"Are there any flowers that look like bells?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Lilies o' th' valley does,\" he answered, digging away with the trowel, \"an' there's Canterbury bells, an' campanulas.\"\n\n\"Let us plant some,\" said Clara.[Pg 136]\n\n\"There's lilies o' th' valley here already; I saw 'em. They'll have growed too close an' we'll have to separate 'em, but there's plenty. Th' other ones takes two years to bloom from seed, but I can bring you some bits o' plants from our cottage garden. Why does tha' want 'em?\"\n\nThen Clara told him about Jasper and his brothers and sisters in India and of how she had hated them and of their calling her \"Mistress Clara Quite Contrary.\"\n\n\"They used to dance round and sing at me. They sang—\n\n'Mistress Clara, quite contrary,\nHow does your garden grow?\nWith silver bells, and cockle shells,\nAnd marigolds all in a row.'\nI just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers like silver bells.\"\n\nShe frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into the earth.\n\n\"I wasn't as contrary as they were.\"\n\nBut Ewan laughed.\n\n\"Eh!\" he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he was sniffing up the scent of it, \"there doesn't seem to be no need for no one to be contrary when there's flowers an' such like, an' such lots o' friendly wild things runnin'[Pg 137] about makin' homes for themselves, or buildin' nests an' singin' an' whistlin', does there?\"\n\nClara, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him and stopped frowning.\n\n\"Ewan,\" she said. \"You are as nice as Libby said you were. I like you, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I should like five people.\"\n\nEwan sat up on his heels as Libby did when she was polishing the grate. He did look funny and delightful, Clara thought, with his round blue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.\n\n\"Only five folk as tha' likes?\" he said. \"Who is th' other four?\"\n\n\"Your mother and Libby,\" Clara checked them off on her fingers, \"and the robin and Gus Greenfield.\"\n\nEwan laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting his arm over his mouth.\n\n\"I know tha' thinks I'm a queer lad,\" he said, \"but I think tha' art th' queerest little lass I ever saw.\"\n\nThen Clara did a strange thing. She leaned forward and asked him a question she had never dreamed of asking any one before. And she tried to ask it in Yorkshire because that was his lan[Pg 138]guage, and in India a native was always pleased if you knew his speech.\n\n\"Does tha' like me?\" she said.\n\n\"Eh!\" he answered heartily, \"that I does. I likes thee wonderful, an' so does th' robin, I do believe!\"\n\n\"That's two, then,\" said Clara. \"That's two for me.\"\n\nAnd then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully. Clara was startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strike the hour of her midday dinner.\n\n\"I shall have to go,\" she said mournfully. \"And you will have to go too, won't you?\"\n\nEwan grinned.\n\n\"My dinner's easy to carry about with me,\" he said. \"Mother always lets me put a bit o' somethin' in my pocket.\"\n\nHe picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpy little bundle tied up in a quiet clean, coarse, blue and white handkerchief. It held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of something laid between them.\n\n\"It's oftenest naught but bread,\" he said, \"but I've got a fine slice o' fat bacon with it to-day.\"\n\nClara thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed ready to enjoy it.\n\n\"Run on an' get thy victuals,\" he said. \"I'll [Pg 139]be done with mine first. I'll get some more work done before I start back home.\"\n\nHe sat down with his back against a tree.\n\n\"I'll call th' robin up,\" he said, \"and give him th' rind o' th' bacon to peck at. They likes a bit o' fat wonderful.\"\n\nClara could scarcely bear to leave him. Suddenly it seemed as if he might be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the garden again. He seemed too good to be true. She went slowly half-way to the door in the wall and then she stopped and went back.\n\n\"Whatever happens, you—you never would tell?\" she said.\n\nHis poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of bread and bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly.\n\n\"If tha' was a missel thrush an' showed me where thy nest was, does tha' think I'd tell any one? Not me,\" he said. \"Tha' art as safe as a missel thrush.\"\n\nAnd she was quite sure she was.[Pg 140]\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\"MIGHT I HAVE A BIT OF EARTH?\"\nClara ran so fast that she was rather out of breath when she reached her room. Her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were bright pink. Her dinner was waiting on the table, and Libby was waiting near it.\n\n\"Tha's a bit late,\" she said. \"Where has tha' been?\"\n\n\"I've seen Ewan!\" said Clara. \"I've seen Ewan!\"\n\n\"I knew he'd come,\" said Libby exultantly. \"How does tha' like him?\"\n\n\"I think—I think he's beautiful!\" said Clara in a determined voice.\n\nLibby looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"he's th' best lad as ever was born, but us never thought he was handsome. His nose turns up too much.\"\n\n\"I like it to turn up,\" said Clara.\n\n\"An' his eyes is so round,\" said Libby, a [Pg 141]trifle doubtful. \"Though they're a nice color.\"\n\n\"I like them round,\" said Clara. \"And they are exactly the color of the sky over the moor.\"\n\nLibby beamed with satisfaction.\n\n\"Mother says he made 'em that color with always lookin' up at th' birds an' th' clouds. But he has got a big mouth, hasn't he, now?\"\n\n\"I love his big mouth,\" said Clara obstinately. \"I wish mine were just like it.\"\n\nLibby chuckled delightedly.\n\n\"It'd look rare an' funny in thy bit of a face,\" she said. \"But I knowed it would be that way when tha' saw him. How did tha' like th' seeds an' th' garden tools?\"\n\n\"How did you know he brought them?\" asked Clara.\n\n\"Eh! I never thought of him not bringin' 'em. He'd be sure to bring 'em if they was in Yorkshire. He's such a trusty lad.\"\n\nClara was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult questions, but she did not. She was very much interested in the seeds and gardening tools, and there was only one moment when Clara was frightened. This was when she began to ask where the flowers were to be planted.\n\n\"Who did tha' ask about it?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I haven't asked anybody yet,\" said Clara, hesitating.[Pg 142]\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't ask th' head gardener. He's too grand, Mr. Finch is.\"\n\n\"I've never seen him,\" said Clara. \"I've only seen under-gardeners and Gus Greenfield.\"\n\n\"If I was you, I'd ask Gus Greenfield,\" advised Libby. \"He's not half as bad as he looks, for all he's so crabbed. Mr. Thornfield lets him do what he likes because he was here when Mrs. Thornfield was alive, an' he used to make her laugh. She liked him. Perhaps he'd find you a corner somewhere out o' the way.\"\n\n\"If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one could mind my having it, could they?\" Clara said anxiously.\n\n\"There wouldn't be no reason,\" answered Libby. \"You wouldn't do no harm.\"\n\nClara ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she rose from the table she was going to run to her room to put on her hat again, but Libby stopped her.\n\n\"I've got somethin' to tell you,\" she said. \"I thought I'd let you eat your dinner first. Mr. Thornfield came back this mornin' and I think he wants to see you.\"\n\nClara turned quite pale.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said. \"Why! Why! He didn't want to see me when I came. I heard Pitcher say he didn't.\"[Pg 143]\n\n\"Well,\" explained Libby, \"Mrs. Winslow says it's because o' mother. She was walkin' to Thwaite village an' she met him. She'd never spoke to him before, but Mrs. Thornfield had been to our cottage two or three times. He'd forgot, but mother hadn't an' she made bold to stop him. I don't know what she said to him about you but she said somethin' as put him in th' mind to see you before he goes away again, to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Clara, \"is he going away to-morrow? I am so glad!\"\n\n\"He's goin' for a long time. He mayn't come back till autumn or winter. He's goin' to travel in foreign places. He's always doin' it.\"\n\n\"Oh! I'm so glad—so glad!\" said Clara thankfully.\n\nIf he did not come back until winter, or even autumn, there would be time to watch the secret garden come alive. Even if he found out then and took it away from her she would have had that much at least.\n\n\"When do you think he will want to see—\"\n\nShe did not finish the sentence, because the door opened, and Mrs. Winslow walked in. She had on her best black dress and cap, and her collar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man's face on it. It was a colored photograph of Mr. Winslow who had died years ago, and she [Pg 144]always wore it when she was dressed up. She looked nervous and excited.\n\n\"Your hair's rough,\" she said quickly. \"Go and brush it. Libby, help her to slip on her best dress. Mr. Thornfield sent me to bring her to him in his study.\"\n\nAll the pink left Clara's cheeks. Her heart began to thump and she felt herself changing into a stiff, plain, silent child again. She did not even answer Mrs. Winslow, but turned and walked into her bedroom, followed by Libby. She said nothing while her dress was changed, and her hair brushed, and after she was quite tidy she followed Mrs. Winslow down the corridors, in silence. What was there for her to say? She was obliged to go and see Mr. Thornfield and he would not like her, and she would not like him. She knew what he would think of her.\n\nShe was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before. At last Mrs. Winslow knocked at a door, and when some one said, \"Come in,\" they entered the room together. A man was sitting in an armchair before the fire, and Mrs. Winslow spoke to him.\n\n\"This is Miss Clara, sir,\" she said.\n\n\"You can go and leave her here. I will ring for you when I want you to take her away,\" said Mr. Thornfield.[Pg 145]\n\nWhen she went out and closed the door, Clara could only stand waiting, a plain little thing, twisting her thin hands together. She could see that the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high, rather crooked shoulders, and he had black hair streaked with white. He turned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her.\n\n\"Come here!\" he said.\n\nClara went to him.\n\nHe was not ugly. His face would have been handsome if it had not been so miserable. He looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him and as if he did not know what in the world to do with her.\n\n\"Are you well?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Clara.\n\n\"Do they take good care of you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over.\n\n\"You are very thin,\" he said.\n\n\"I am getting fatter,\" Clara answered in what she knew was her stiffest way.\n\nWhat an unhappy face he had! His black eyes seemed as if they scarcely saw her, as if they were seeing something else, and he could hardly keep his thoughts upon her.[Pg 146]\n\n\"I forgot you,\" he said. \"How could I remember you? I intended to send you a governess or a nurse, or some one of that sort, but I forgot.\"\n\n\"Please,\" began Clara. \"Please—\" and then the lump in her throat choked her.\n\n\"What do you want to say?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I am—I am too big for a nurse,\" said Clara. \"And please—please don't make me have a governess yet.\"\n\nHe rubbed his forehead again and stared at her.\n\n\"That was what the Morrow woman said,\" he muttered absent-mindedly.\n\nThen Clara gathered a scrap of courage.\n\n\"Is she—is she Libby's mother?\" she stammered.\n\n\"Yes, I think so,\" he replied.\n\n\"She knows about children,\" said Clara. \"She has twelve. She knows.\"\n\nHe seemed to rouse himself.\n\n\"What do you want to do?\"\n\n\"I want to play out of doors,\" Clara answered, hoping that her voice did not tremble. \"I never liked it in India. It makes me hungry here, and I am getting fatter.\"\n\nHe was watching her.\n\n\"Mrs. Morrow said it would do you good. Perhaps it will,\" he said. \"She thought you had [Pg 147]better get stronger before you had a governess.\"\n\n\"It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor,\" argued Clara.\n\n\"Where do you play?\" he asked next.\n\n\"Everywhere,\" gasped Clara. \"Libby's mother sent me a skipping-rope. I skip and run—and I look about to see if things are beginning to stick up out of the earth. I don't do any harm.\"\n\n\"Don't look so frightened,\" he said in a worried voice. \"You could not do any harm, a child like you! You may do what you like.\"\n\nClara put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid he might see the excited lump which she felt jump into it. She came a step nearer to him.\n\n\"May I?\" she said tremulously.\n\nHer anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever.\n\n\"Don't look so frightened,\" he exclaimed. \"Of course you may. I am your guardian, though I am a poor one for any child. I cannot give you time or attention. I am too ill, and wretched and distracted; but I wish you to be happy and comfortable. I don't know anything about children, but Mrs. Winslow is to see that you have all you need. I sent for you to-day because Mrs. Sow[Pg 148]erby said I ought to see you. Her daughter had talked about you. She thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running about.\"\n\n\"She knows all about children,\" Clara said again in spite of herself.\n\n\"She ought to,\" said Mr. Thornfield. \"I thought her rather bold to stop me on the moor, but she said—Mrs. Thornfield had been kind to her.\" It seemed hard for him to speak his dead wife's name. \"She is a respectable woman. Now I have seen you I think she said sensible things. Play out of doors as much as you like. It's a big place and you may go where you like and amuse yourself as you like. Is there anything you want?\" as if a sudden thought had struck him. \"Do you want toys, books, dolls?\"\n\n\"Might I,\" quavered Clara, \"might I have a bit of earth?\"\n\nIn her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would sound and that they were not the ones she had meant to say. Mr. Thornfield looked quite startled.\n\n\"Earth!\" he repeated. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"To plant seeds in—to make things grow—to see them come alive,\" Clara faltered.\n\nHe gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over his eyes.[Pg 149]\n\n\"Do you—care about gardens so much,\" he said slowly.\n\n\"I didn't know about them in India,\" said Clara. \"I was always ill and tired and it was too hot. I sometimes made little beds in the sand and stuck flowers in them. But here it is different.\"\n\nMr. Thornfield got up and began to walk slowly across the room.\n\n\"A bit of earth,\" he said to himself, and Clara thought that somehow she must have reminded him of something. When he stopped and spoke to her his dark eyes looked almost soft and kind.\n\n\"You can have as much earth as you want,\" he said. \"You remind me of some one else who loved the earth and things that grow. When you see a bit of earth you want,\" with something like a smile, \"take it, child, and make it come alive.\"\n\n\"May I take it from anywhere—if it's not wanted?\"\n\n\"Anywhere,\" he answered. \"There! You must go now, I am tired.\" He touched the bell to call Mrs. Winslow. \"Good-by. I shall be away all summer.\"\n\nMrs. Winslow came so quickly that Clara thought she must have been waiting in the corridor.\n\n\"Mrs. Winslow,\" Mr. Thornfield said to her,[Pg 150] \"now I have seen the child I understand what Mrs. Morrow meant. She must be less delicate before she begins lessons. Give her simple, healthy food. Let her run wild in the garden. Don't look after her too much. She needs liberty and fresh air and romping about. Mrs. Morrow is to come and see her now and then and she may sometimes go to the cottage.\"\n\nMrs. Winslow looked pleased. She was relieved to hear that she need not \"look after\" Clara too much. She had felt her a tiresome charge and had indeed seen as little of her as she dared. In addition to this she was fond of Libby's mother.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" she said. \"Ella Morrow and me went to school together and she's as sensible and good-hearted a woman as you'd find in a day's walk. I never had any children myself and she's had twelve, and there never was healthier or better ones. Miss Clara can get no harm from them. I'd always take Ella Morrow's advice about children myself. She's what you might call healthy-minded—if you understand me.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Mr. Thornfield answered. \"Take Miss Clara away now and send Pitcher to me.\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Winslow left her at the end of her own corridor Clara flew back to her room. She [Pg 151]found Libby waiting there. Libby had, in fact, hurried back after she had removed the dinner service.\n\n\"I can have my garden!\" cried Clara. \"I may have it where I like! I am not going to have a governess for a long time! Your mother is coming to see me and I may go to your cottage! He says a little girl like me could not do any harm and I may do what I like—anywhere!\"\n\n\"Eh!\" said Libby delightedly, \"that was nice of him wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Libby,\" said Clara solemnly, \"he is really a nice man, only his face is so miserable and his forehead is all drawn together.\"\n\nShe ran as quickly as she could to the garden. She had been away so much longer than she had thought she sh",
